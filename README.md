# Detailed Operation Steps
## 1.1 Data Sources
### 1.1.1 CiteSpace 6.2 R4 Analysis
The data source includes the Web of Science database. The study period ranges from January 1, 2004, to January 1, 2024, using a keyword search method. The search keywords are the English terms “internal fixation” and “materials.” Articles were screened based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and duplicate entries were removed. This process resulted in a total of 2,344 English articles.
### 1.1.2 VOSviewer Analysis
The Web of Science database was used as the data source. The search terms were “internal fixation” and “materials,” with English as the publication language. Articles were screened based on established inclusion and exclusion criteria, and duplicate articles were excluded. A random selection of recent relevant articles resulted in a total of 2,344 articles.
## 1.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
### 1.2.1Inclusion Criteria:
Included document types: articles and research papers.
Excluded document types: duplicate articles, conference abstracts, press releases, informational pieces, and reviews.
### 1.2.2 Relevance to the Topic:
Studies related to the themes of “internal fixation” and “materials,” covering various material types, fixation device performance, biocompatibility, and other related topics.
## 1.3 Data Processing and Analysis
The retrieved Chinese literature was screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, exported in Refworks format, and renamed as “download_01-download_03.” CiteSpace 6.2 R4 software was then used to visualize authors, institutions, and keywords, generating visual analysis graphs to further describe the research status, hotspots, and trends in internal fixation materials.
English literature retrieved from the Web of Science database was screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The relevant articles were exported in RIS format and renamed “download_04.” Articles exported in Plain Text File format were renamed as “download_05-download_12.” CiteSpace 6.2 R4 and VOSviewer software were used to conduct visual analyses of authors, institutions, and keywords, generating visual analysis graphs to further describe the research status, hotspots, and trends in internal fixation materials.
## 1.4 Analysis Parameter Settings
### 1.4.1 CiteSpace 6.2 R4 Analysis Settings
An analysis target folder needs to be created, containing four subfolders named “input,” “output,” “data,” and “project.” The processed exported data should be placed in the “input” folder. Use the CiteSpace 6.2 R4 data key for data format conversion, selecting an appropriate literature data source such as Web of Science. Once the data conversion is complete, move the converted files from the “output” folder to the “data” folder and create a new working dataset. On the new page, name the dataset, set the default data source to WoS, and save it. Set the interval for literature data, and choose options like “author” and “keyword” for visualization analysis. After completing the analysis, click on the visualization map options and highlight keywords as needed.
### 1.4.2 VOSviewer Analysis
Create a target analysis folder and place the exported database data within it. Click “Create” to set parameters, selecting the option “Create a map based on text data.” Choose the database data source and open the corresponding folder by selecting the appropriate database button. Select the “Title” and “Abstract” fields, choose the “Binary Counting” option, and adjust the frequency and interval of keyword display according to personal preference. Finally, generate a keyword clustering map. To obtain the final visual density map, select the “Density Visualization” option.
