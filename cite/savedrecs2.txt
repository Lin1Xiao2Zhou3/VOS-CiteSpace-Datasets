However, there are some limitations related to its limited access. The goal of the present study is to describe a modified 2-incision STA and to evaluate the radiographic and clinical outcomes in the treatment of DIACF. Materials and methods: Patients had a Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen/Orthopaedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA) classification 82-C, Sanders type II, III calcaneal fracture, and underwent modified 2-incision STA and internal fixation were included in this retrospective study. Serial radiographic measurements and clinical assessment were taken to evaluate the effectiveness of this technique. Results: Thirty-four feet of 33 patients treated between 2014 and 2019 were included with an average follow-up of 28.5 (range, 12-65) months. Mean preoperative Bohler's angle was 1.5 +/- 10.0 (range, -26.0-16.9) degrees and mean final Bohler' angle was 29.8 +/- 4.9 (range, 19.3-39.3) degrees with significant difference (P < .001). The average American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score and visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score at last follow-up were 86.2 +/- 5.0 (range, 76-97) and 1.6 +/- 1.1 (range, 0-4), respectively. Major complications included 2 (5.9%) wound infections and 1 (2.9%) incomplete separation of the lateral wall prior to plate insertion. Discussion and conclusions: This modified 2-incision STA is a safe and effective procedure. It allows access to the posterior facet and posterior calcaneal tuberosity, appropriate restoration of blowout lateral wall, and easy placement of a standard calcaneal plate. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Early recognition of the problem and appropriate management usually yields satisfactory outcomes. Closed or open reduction with Kirschner-wire (KW) is a cost-effective choice of fixation method for displaced fracture. However, various other methods, including partially threaded cannulated cancellous screw and biodegradable pin (BP), have also been used. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of BP and compare its clinical outcomes with KW. Material and methods: Patients with LCF admitted from January 2008 to January 2016 at our institute were reviewed retrospectively. Baseline information and clinical data were collected from Hospital Database. Patients were divided into the KW group and BP group. Results: In all, 85 patients (male 50, female 35) in the KW group and 76 patients (male 47, female 29) in the BP group were included in this study. The average age of patients in the KW group was 5.2 years, and that of BP was 5.9 years. No nonunion or malunion was observed in either group. At the last follow-up visit, there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups with regard to elbow function and appearance. The incidence of long-term complications, including avascular necrosis, fishtail deformity, and lateral prominence, showed no significant difference between both the groups. The incidence of hardware prominence was higher in the KW (13/85, 15.6%) than BP (2/76, 2.6%) group (P < .001). Conclusions: Both KW and BP are safe and effective choices for LCF of the humerus in children. Both the implant designs produce satisfactory and comparable clinical outcomes. However, BP has the advantage of less hardware prominence, no need for hardware removal, and fewer long-term complications.

Surgical reconstruction is challenging, especially with small and excavated head fragments. A promising surgical option is open reduction and stabilization using the Humerusblock device along with tension wires. The aim of this retrospective investigation was to evaluate the clinical and radiological results of this procedure. Materials and methods: Fifteen patients with symptomatic surgical neck nonunions were treated with open reduction and internal fixation using the Humerusblock device without bone grafting. All patients showed a loss of bone stock, leading to excavated head fragments. The mean interval from injury to the described treatment was 6.2 months (range, 3.4-10.7). At a mean follow-up of 40.5 months, the Constant-Murley score was documented, pain and patient satisfaction were evaluated using a visual analogue scale, and x-rays were taken in two planes. Results: The patients' mean age was 69.7 years (range, 52-83). The mean Constant-Murley score improved from 24 points before surgery to 62 points at follow-up, which was an average of 80.8% of the score obtained for the contralateral arm. Radiological examination confirmed bony healing in 14 patients. All but one patient felt satisfied with the results. Three patients required revision surgery because of a hematoma, and early metal removal was performed in one patient because of infection. Conclusion: Nonunions of humeral surgical neck fractures can be successfully treated by fixation using the Humerusblock device along with tension wires without the need for additional bone grafting. Especially in patients with flat, concave head fragments, this procedure remains a promising reconstructive option to arthroplasty. (c) 2018 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association.

Appropriate decisions could be made by the clinicians with the help of cost-utility analysis (CUA) about optimal healthcare for type II/III calcaneus fracture.MethodA single-center, retrospective study was conducted in which basic characteristics, clinical outcomes, and health care costs of 109 patients had been obtained and analyzed. Changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scores, validated by EuroQol five-dimensional-three levels (EQ-5D-3L), were used to enumerate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost-effectiveness was determined by the incremental cost per QALY.ResultsOne hundred nine patients were enrolled in our study including 62 in the ELA group and 47 in the STA group. There were no significant differences between these two groups in mean total cost, laboratory, and radiographic evaluation expense, surgery, anesthesia, and antibiotic expense. The expense of internal fixation materials ($3289.0 543.9) versus ($2630.6 763.7) and analgesia ($145.8 +/- 85.6) versus ($102.9 +/- 62.7) in ELA group were significantly higher than in the STA group (P < .001, P = .008, respectively). Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores showed significant difference at postoperative 3 and 5days (P < .001). American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot scores and the Bohlers' and Gissane angle showed no significant differences between the two groups before and after the operation. The cost-effectiveness ratios of ELA and STA were $8766.8 +/- 2835.2/QALY and $7914.9 +/- 1822.0/QALY respectively, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICERs) of ELA over STA was $32110.00/QALY, but both showed no significant difference.Conclusion Both ELA and STA techniques are effective operative procedures for the patients with calcaneus fracture. Moreover, STA seems to be more reasonable for its merits including less postoperative pain, and less expense of analgesia as well as internal fixation materials.Level of evidence	[Li, Zihua; Wu, Xinbo; Zhou, Haichao; Xu, Shaochen; Xiao, Fajiao; Huang, Hui; Yang, Yunfeng] Tongji Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthoped, Shanghai Tongji Hosp, Shanghai 200065, Peoples R China	Tongji University	Yang, YF (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthoped, Shanghai Tongji Hosp, Shanghai 200065, Peoples R China.	dr_yangyf123@163.com	Yang, Yunfeng/JLM-4147-2023; Li, Zihua/HJI-7616-2023	Li, Zihua/0000-0002-6087-7459	National Natural Science Foundation of China [31800782]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))	1.

JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							CORTICAL BONE SCREWS; MAXILLOMANDIBULAR FIXATION; MANDIBULAR FRACTURES; MANAGEMENT; REDUCTION; OUTCOMES	Purpose: To compare the outcomes of mandible fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation versus adjunctive intermaxillary fixation (IMF) using 2 different techniques. Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective medical record review. The medical records of consecutive patients with mandible fractures treated surgically with adjunctive use of IMF (embrasure wires vs arch bars) were reviewed for demographic data, etiology, fracture location, antibiotic use, and interval to repair. Specifically, the complications, including infection, malunion or nonunion, hardware failure, and wound dehiscence, were recorded. The data were analyzed using Student's t test and the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Statistical significance was set at P < .05. A descriptive cost analysis was also performed and compared with those from previously published studies. Results: The data from 86 subjects were included in the present study. Of the 86 subjects, 33 were in the embrasure wire group and 53 in the arch bar group. Of the patients in the arch bar group, 26% had complications compared with 15% in the embrasure wire IMF group. No statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of infection (P = .63), hardware failure (P = .75), malocclusion (P = .85), and nonunion (P = 1.0). However, the cost of arch bar placement and removal was approximately $ 2,672 more than the placement of embrasure wires. Conclusions: Patients treated with embrasure wire IMF had slightly better clinical outcomes compared with those treated with arch bar IMF. Also, the cost reduction for patients treated with embrasure wire IMF was significant.

Method Humeral 3D models were reconstructed by MIMICS after volunteers' CT image input in *.dicom format, and processed by Geomagic Studio for surfaces, while locking plates and screws were then designed by Pro-E. A humeral model of T-type fracture was created and assembled in Hypermesh, to integrate fixtures (e.g., MPL/PML/ML), to grid the mesh and then assign materials. A musculoskeletal model of the upper limb was established by AnyBody to simulate elbow flexion and extension. They were finally imported to Abaqus for boundary conditions and dynamic analysis. Result In terms of Von Mises stress, its maximum increased and then decreased gradually during the joint motion, but p > 0.05 in SPSS suggests no significant difference for all three fixtures. In terms of displacement, when the elbow was at 90 degrees, each motional pattern reached its peak as follows: ML180 degrees = 0.28 mm, MPL90 degrees = 0.49 mm & PML90 degrees = 0.54 mm during flexion; ML180 degrees = 0.073 mm, MPL90 degrees = 0.10 mm & PML90 degrees = 0.12 mm during extension. p p = 0.007 < 0.01667 suggests the significant difference between the two fixations, for example, PML90 degrees and ML180 degrees, indicating that the peak displacement of ML180 degrees is less than that of PML90 degrees. Conclusion After generally analysed in musculoskeletal dynamics, the biomechanical property of the fixtures was presented as follows: the displacement of the parallel plate was less than that of the vertical, and the parallel plate may optimise the clinical reduction anatomically.

Methods: A locking distal radius system was used in a combination of a dorsal and styloid plate (group 1), a single volar plate (group 2), and a combination of a volar and styloid plate (group 3) configuration. In addition a single volar 3.5-mm steel locking plate was used in group 4. Each construct was tested on 6 fresh-frozen radii with simulated unstable dorsally comminuted extra-articular distal radius fractures. Specimens were tested on a material testing machine with an extensometer and subjected to axial compression fatigue and load-to-failure testing. Results: No construct failed in fatigue testing of 250 N for 5,000 cycles. Two specimens in each group were tested for 20,000 cycles without failure. The plastic deformation in the double-plate groups was lower compared with the single-plate groups, although the difference was not statistically significant. Group 1 had the highest and group 4 the lowest failure load and stiffness, respectively. The differences between group 1 and the other groups, except failure load compared with group 3, were statistically significant. Groups 2 and 3 had a significantly higher load to failure and group 3 had a significantly higher stiffness compared with group 4. Conclusions: All constructs offer adequate stability with minimal deformation on fatigue testing under physiologic conditions. Dorsal fixed-angle constructs are stiffer and stronger than volar constructs. The addition of a styloid plate to a volar plate did not significantly improve stability in this model of simulated extra-articular dorsal comminution loaded in axial compression.

Recent studies have reported that the use of absorbable materials, instead of metallic ones, may lead to a lower incidence of postoperative infection. In this experimental pre-clinical animal study, we compared the infection rate between absorbable implants consisting of copolymers composed from trimethylene carbonate, L-polylactic acid, and D, L-polylactic acid monomers, and titanium implants after the inoculation of a pathogenic microorganism. Material and Methods: We used an experimental implant-related infection model in rabbits. Sixty animals were randomly and equally divided into two groups. In all animals, the right femur was exposed via a lateral approach and a 2.5 mm two-hole titanium plate with screws (Group A), or a two-hole absorbable plate and screws (Group B), were applied in the femoral shaft. Afterwards, the implant surface was inoculated with Pseudomonas Aeruginosa at a concentration of 2 x 108 CFU/mL. The primary outcome was the comparison of the incidence of developed infection between the two groups. The wound condition was monitored on a daily basis and radiographies were obtained at 12 weeks postoperatively. Infection-related laboratory markers (white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein values) were assessed at 3, 6, and 16 weeks postoperatively. Histologic analysis and cultures of tissue samples were also performed to evaluate the presence of infection. Results: Clinical and laboratory signs of infection were evident in 11 rabbits in Group A (36.7%), and 4 in Group B (13.3%). The difference between the groups was statistically significant (p = 0.04). Five animals in Group B (16.7%) had clinical and histologic signs of a foreign-body reaction with significantly elevated CRP and ESR values but no simultaneous presence of infection was identified (p = 0.04). Bone remodelling with thickening of the periosteum and surrounding sclerosis was demonstrated radiologically in animals developing infection or foreign-body reactions. Conclusions: Absorbable plates and screws show lower susceptibility to infection compared to titanium ones. However, their application is associated with foreign-body reaction and the potential need for a second surgical intervention.

We describe a new percutaneous minimally invasive spinal fixation system based on pedicle screws and inflatable rods. The rods are inserted in a flexible state and harden following deployment. We test this system in terms of biocompatibility, ferromagnetism, magnetic resonance artifact production, bench top mechanical testing, ease of insertion within cadavers, potential thermal damage to paraspinous muscles in pigs, and long-term device tolerability in sheep. Objectives. To determine the safety and utility of this system before its use in human subjects. Summary of Background Data. Composite materials and epoxy compounds have been used safely in a variety of implanted medical devices for years with no signs of systemic toxicity or significant device failures. Methods. Long-term biocompatibility test of system components was conducted according to International Standards Organization 10993 and Food and Drug Administration Blue Book Memorandum # G95-1 standards. Device components were assessed for magnetic deflection and torque and imaged in a 1.5 Tesla magnetic resonance unit. Full constructs of the system were tested for compression strength, torque, and fatigue per American Society for Testing and Materials F1717 standards. The system was deployed using C-arm fluoroscopic guidance in 11 cadavers and 2 live sheep. Further, the inflatable rods were tested for exothermic damage to paraspinous musculature in 2 pigs. Results. All system components were found to be biocompatible, nonferromagnetic, and produce little magnetic resonance artifact. Compression and torque results for the new system were found to be comparable to standard metallic pedicle screw and rod fixation systems. However, the new system displayed a superior modulus of elasticity relative to standard surgical systems. The new system endured 5 million cycles of repetitive compressions without breakage or significant wear. All cadaver and sheep insertions were performed successfully. Sheep suffered no complications, and minimal blood loss occurred during device insertions. One of the animals killed at 6 months demonstrated no internal organ damage. The self-curing version of polymer used to inflate the flexible rods cured to approximately 53% of its final strength in 90 minutes with maximum external rod temperature of 40.5 C. and no adjacent thermal damage within porcine paraspinous musculature. Conclusions. The new spinal fixation system is biocompatible, uses a nontoxic polymer, is magnetic resonance compatible, displays favorable biomechanical characteristics, can be easily deployed percutaneously using simple fluoroscopic guidance, is well tolerated in living sheep, caused no muscular thermal damage, and could be used in humans within a reasonable operative time frame. The new system demonstrates the feasibility of percutaneously constructing composite structures in situ within the body.

Unlike typical covalent organic frameworks, remarkably, these materials remain dispersed as single- to few-layer films in solution, presumably because of protonation of pyrazine motifs by the strong acid employed in the synthesis The C2Ps can be easily drop-cast onto solid surfaces for characterization and fabrication of electronic devices. The thin polymer films display a long-range internal order and exhibit high hole mobility up to 4 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1), the highest among C2Ps, which paves the way to design high-performance optoelectronic devices.

This biotnechanical study evaluated the strength of the reattached tuberosities in reverse total shoulder arthroplasty fixed with cables or with sutures in a cerclage-like technique. Considering the mechanical advantages of flexible titanium alloy cables compared with conventional sutures for cerclage-like fixations, we hypothesized that titanium alloy cables would achieve higher fixation strengths of the tuberosities compared with heavy nonabsorbable sutures. Methods: A 4-part fracture was created on 8-paired proximal human humeri. The tuberosities were reduced anatomically and fixed by 2 heavy nonabsorbable sutures (suture group) or by two 1-mm titanium alloy cables (cable group) in a cerclage-like technique around the neck of the prosthesis. The humeri were placed in a custom-made test setup enabling internal and external rotation. Cyclic loading with a stepwise increasing load magnitude was applied with a material testing machine, starting with 1 Nm and increasing the load by 0.25 Nm after each 100th cycle until failure of the fixation occurred (>15 degrees rotation of the tuberosities). Any motion of the tuberosities was measured with a 3-dimensional ultrasound motion analysis system. Results: Overall. the cable group reached 1414 +/- 372 cycles, and the suture group reached 1257 +/- 230 cycles until the fixations failed (P = .313). The suture group showed a significantly higher rotation of the lesser tuberosity relative to the humerus shaft axis after 200, 400, and 600 cycles compared with the cable group (P = .018-.043). Conclusions: Tuberosities reattached with cable cerclages showed higher fixation strength and therefore less rotation compared with suture cerclages in a 4-part proximal humeral fracture model treated with reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. Whether this higher fixation strength results in higher bony ingrowth rates of the tuberosities and thus leads to a better clinical outcome needs to be investigated in further clinical studies.

Size and stabilization of the dorsoulnar fragment in AO C3-type distal radius fractures	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Distal radius fracture; Volar locking plate; Lunate facet; Displacement; Rim; Dorsoulnar fragment	VOLAR PLATE FIXATION; LUNATE FACET; WRIST JOINT; DORSAL	Introduction: Volar locking plate (VLP) fixation has become the gold-standard treatment for distal radius fractures (DRFs). Especially, internal fixation of the volar lunate facet fragment is essential for the treatment of AO C3-type DRFs. On the other hand, the necessity of the fixation of the dorsal lunate facet fragment (dorsoulnar fragment) remains unclear. The purpose of the present study was to measure three-dimensionally the size of the dorsoulnar fragments in AO C3-type DRFs using computed tomography (CT) images in detail, and to reveal relationships of the size and stabilization of the dorsoulnar fragment with postoperative fracture displacement after VLP fixation. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the 101 consecutive Japanese patients who underwent surgical treatment for AO C3-type distal radius fractures. If patient had dorsoulnar fragment, the three-dimensional size of this fragment and the occupying ratio to the radiocarpal joint (RCJ) and the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) were anatomically evaluated using the preoperative CT images. In addition, we investigated the relationship of the size and stabilization of the dorsoulnar fragment with fracture displacement after VLP fixation. We statistically compared the size parameters and occupying ratio of the dorsoulnar fragment between the displaced group and the stable groups using a two-tailed t-test. We also statistically compared the numbers of screws inserted into the dorsoulnar fragments between the displaced and stable groups using a chi-square test. Results: The mean dorsoulnar fragment size was 9.4 mm x 7.9 mm x 11.0 mm and the occupying ratio to the DRUJ and RCJ was 50% and 10%, respectively. The number of patients treated with volar locking plate fixation was 77, of which 12 patients had postoperative displacements. Although the size of the dorsoulnar fragment was not associated with postoperative displacement, stabilization following screw insertion into the dorsoulnar fragment was significantly associated with displacement. Conclusion: Stabilization of the dorsoulnar fragment with at least one screw of the volar locking plate was necessary to prevent postoperative fracture displacement regardless of dorsoulnar fragment size in AO C3-type distal radius fractures.

Implant loosening or failure has been demonstrated to commonly occur at some subacute point during the postoperative period. The purpose of this study is to report on a series of patients with traumatic pelvic ring disruptions to determine the incidence and common factors associated with early postoperative symphyseal plate failure before 7 weeks. Materials and methods: 126 patients retrospectively identified with unstable pelvic injuries treated with open reduction and plate fixation of the symphysis pubis and iliosacral screw fixation. Preoperative and postoperative radiographs, computed tomography (CT) images, and medical chart were reviewed to determine symphyseal displacement preoperatively and postoperatively, time until plate failure, patient symptoms and symphyseal displacement at failure, subsequent symphyseal displacement, incidence of additional surgery, and patient weight bearing compliance. Results: 14 patients (11.1%) sustained premature postoperative fixation failure. 13 patients had anteroposterior compression (APC)-II injuries and 1 patient had an APC-III injury. Preoperative symphyseal displacement was 35.6 millimeters (mm) (20.8-52.9). Postoperative symphyseal space measurement was 6.3 mm (4.7-9.3). Time until plate failure was 29 days (5-47). Nine patients (64.2%) noted a pop surrounding the time of failure. Symphyseal space measurement at failure was 12.4 mm (5.6-20.5). All patients demonstrated additional symphyseal displacement averaging 2.6 mm (0.2-9.4). Two patients (14.2%) underwent revision. Four patients (28.5%) were non-compliant. Conclusion: Premature failure of symphysis pubis plating is not uncommon. In this series, further symphyseal displacement after plate failure was not substantial. The presence of acute symphyseal plate failure alone may not be an absolute indication for revision surgery. Making patient education a priority could lead to decreased postoperative non-compliance and potentially a decreased incidence of implant failure. Posterior pelvic ring fixation aides overall pelvic ring stability and may help minimize further displacement after early postoperative symphyseal plate failure. Further functional outcome and biomechanical studies surrounding early symphyseal plate failure are needed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The selection of the most appropriate osteobiologic from the growing list of available options can be a challenging task. In selecting a material, surgeons should weigh a variety of considerations, including the indication for their use (the when), the most suitable substance (the what), and the correct mode of application (the how). This summary reviews these considerations and seeks to provide the surgeon with a basis for informed clinical evidence-based decision-making in their choice of a successful option.

The purpose of this study was to determine clinical outcomes in patients with open pilon fractures treated as per BOAST guidelines alongside a treatment protocol which consisted of early wound debridement and spanning external fixation, delayed soft tissue coverage with a flap when necessary and delayed definitive fixation with the use of a Fine Wire Fixator. Material and methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of open pilon fractures treated between 2014 and 2019. All patients were included for the assessment of the rate of infection and fracture healing. Functional outcome assessment was performed in all patients according to the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) at 12 months post injury. Results: There were 20 patients including 16 males and 4 females. The mean age was 50.45 years. Initial wound with bone debridement and application of a spanning external fixator was performed within an average of 13.5 hours. The mean time from primary surgery to definitive fixation was 24.5 days. There were 3 patients with Gustilo Type I injuries, 6 with Type II, 4 Type with type IIIa and 7 with Type IIIb injuries. Average time to bone union was 10.4 (Range: 2-18) months. The mean AOFAS score was 74.2 (Range: 28-97). A Taylor Spatial Frame was used on 18 patients, while 2 patients had an Ilizarov frame. A corticotomy was performed on 4 patients with critical bone defect post debridement. There was 1 case of deep infection and 9 cases of superficial infection. There were also 4 cases of delayed union which required bone grafting from their femur using a RIA (Reamer Irrigation Aspirator). Conclusion: Our study suggests that the use of staged wound debridement including relatively aggressive bone debridement in conjunction with systemic and local antibiotics, external fixators and patient tailored conversion from spanning external fixator to fine wire frame achieves low rates of wound infection and complications for patients with open pilon fractures.

The aim of our study was to compare clinical and radiological outcomes in patients alternatively treated with plates and screws or external fixation system for a type III-IV proximal humerus fracture. Material and methods: Sixty-nine patients went surgery for type III-IV PHF between January 2011 and January 2014. According to the Neer classification, fractures were classified as type III in 50 cases (72,46%) and type IV in 19 cases (24,56%). 45 patients were treated with plates (65%) and 24 external flxators (35%). The patients' mean age was 62 years (range, 31-87 y). At five years, 60 patients (86,9%) were assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, Constant Score (CS), the range of motion, and radiological evaluation. The CS at five years was the primary outcome measure. Results were evaluated and compared with the contralateral unaffected side to avoid bias related to different ages. Results: At the final follow up, we found no clinical differences when comparing the two procedures. Moreover, when age was considered as a variable, a significative difference of the CS was observed in the group of patients younger than 65 years treated with a plate (Plate Group Mean: 79; SD: +/- 15. Ex Fi Mean: 58; SD:+/- 4. P= 0,008). In the group of patients older than 65 years, the two procedures did not show significative differences in outcomes (Plate Group Mean: 69; SD: +/- 15. Ex Fi Mean: 63; SD:+/- 7. P = 0,032). External fixation procedure was overall associated with a reduction in blood loss, surgical time, length of hospital stay. Conclusion: Percutaneous techniques have a long tradition in PHF treatment; the introduction of dedicated external fixation system has the advantage to improve the stability and allow early rehabilitation when compared to the classical pinning technique. In our experience, the indication elderly patients with osteoporosis and comorbidities may benefit by this type of mini-invasive surgery with low soft tissue damages. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The accurate analysis of the literature shows that this recommendation relies on low level of evidence in orthopaedic surgery with material implantation (arthroplasty components or implants for internal fixation). This study aimed to assess the attributable risk of smoking on organ/space SSI in orthopaedic surgery with implants. Risk factors of organ/space SSI were studied in a prospective cohort including 3,908 patients from June 2003 to December 2006. Smoking was found as a significant risk factor for organ/space SSI. We also observed a significant difference between smokers and non-smokers for surgical wound complications (hematoma, discharge or wound dehiscence) during the period between surgical procedure and discharge from hospital. This is the first large prospective report of a significant association between smoking and organ/space SSI in orthopaedic surgery with implants.

Several clinical studies have revealed that bone cement filled with hollow pedicle screws can achieve great benefits in the treatment of SP. However, most of the existing bone cement materials are based on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and calcium phosphate cement (CPC). However, PMMA has poor biocompatibility, due to which its actual efficacy is greatly reduced. Although CPC has good biocompatibility, it exhibits certain cytotoxicity and high pressure in the bone marrow, resulting in fat droplets in blood vessels, which may cause embolisms. This study aimed to investigate the actual efficacy of a new type of bone nanocement filled with hollow pedicle screw in the treatment of 11 children with lumbar SP and to provide a feasible surgical method for the treatment of lumbar SP with hollow pedicle screw filled with bone nanocement.

The question of how much does the existence of the screw tunnels affect the strength of the femur and whether the patient needs to be protected with an adjunctive device has been controversial. The objective of this finite element analysis was to determine (1) whether the screw tunnels affects normal weight bearing after removal of internal fixation of a proximal femur fracture, (2) which screw tunnels parameters affect the weight bearing capacity of the entire femur. Hypothesis: The presence of the screw tunnels reduces the load-bearing capacity of the femur, and the arrangement, diameter and wall thickness of the screw tunnels affect the load-bearing capacity of the femur. Materials and methods: Twenty patients who underwent surgical treatment for proximal femur fracture at our hospital were included in the study. Computed tomography (CT) values of the screw tunnel wall in the femur after removal of internal fixations were analysed. Mimics v16.0 and Hypermesh v13.0 software programs were used to generate 3-dimensional (3D) tetrahedral finite element models of the proximal femur with different screw tunnel numbers, diameters, thicknesses, and arrangements. An acetabulum exerting a vertical pressure load of 600 N on the femoral head was simulated and the force on various parts of the femur in each model was calculated. Results: There was no difference in the Hounsfield Units of the tunnel walls and cortical bone of the proximal femur (893.48 +/- 61.28 vs. 926.34 +/- 58.43; p = 0.091). In each of the 3D models, the cancellous bone was the first structure to reach maximal stress. The compressive strength of the femur decreased with increasing thickness of the screw tunnel wall and decreased with increasing tunnel diameter. The femoral neck model with the inverted triangle screw tunnel arrangement had the highest compressive strength. Discussion: The femoral neck with screw tunnels can withstand day-to-day stress without special intervention. For femoral neck fractures fixed with cannulated screws, inverted triangle screws are recommended; For a single screw tunnel in the femoral neck, the larger the diameter of the femoral neck internal screw channel, the weaker the load-bearing capacity of the femur. Level of evidence: III; well-designed computational non-experimental study. (c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Primary clinical trial of limited fixation for unstable Atlas fracture. Objectives. To clinically validate feasibility, safety and value of the C1 later-mass screw C2 pedicle screw and crosslink compression fixation technique. Summary of Background Date. In previous clinical studies, several techniques have been introduced to fix Atlas fracture. But all these treatments have intrinsic disadvantages. Now seeking a means of limited internal fixation has become a worthwhile subject of clinical study. Materials and Methods. From January 2001 to December 2004, 17 cases of atlas fracture were diagnosed consecutively, 11 cases were operated on with C1 lateral mass and C2 pedicle screws and crosslink fixation, of whom 6 patents had axial instability and rupture of transverse ligament, 1 patient had C2 laminal fracture, and the remaining 4 patients had axial instability. With the assistant of regional anatomy study and fluoroscopy C1 lateral mass screws and C2 pedicle screws were implanted in place, between which connecting rods were applied bilaterally. A crosslink compression was applied between the 2 rods to achieve realignment of C1 lateral mass fracture and C0-C1-C2 into the anatomic position. C1-C2 fusion with posterior bone grafting was performed in patients with axial instability or transverse ligament discontinuity. Results. Operative time ranged from 90 to 176 minutes with a mean of 124 minutes. Intraoperative blood loss ranged from 270 to 1200 mL with a mean of 432 mL. There were no neurologic deficits, vertebral artery related complications or other complications in all patients. No deterioration of the neurologic deficits was noticed 5 days after operation when the patients were brace fixed and began to ambulate. No cerebral hemodynamic deficit was observed in this patient. Radiograph examination showed bone fusion and stability in all patients 3 months after operation. Healing of C2 fracture was confirmed by computed tomography scan. Conclusion. Osteosynthesis of the atlas by C1 lateral mass screws C2 pedicle screws and crosslink compression fixation is an ideal option for C1 burst fracture with or without rupture of the transverse ligament. The procedure allows for partially physiologic reconstruction of the C0-C1-C2 joint and shortens external fixation.

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							INTERNAL-FIXATION; MINIPLATE FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; STRUT; PLATE	Purpose: The aim of the present study was to determine which method for internal fixation through a transoral approach has the lowest complication rate for patients with mandibular angle fractures (MAFs). Materials and Methods: To address our study purpose, we designed and implemented a systematic review with meta-analysis. To identify the studies to include in the review, a comprehensive electronic search without date or language restrictions was performed in April 2014. The inclusion criteria were studies of humans, including randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), and retrospective studies, with the aim of comparing fixation techniques (1 vs 2 miniplates, external oblique ridge vs lateral border miniplate placement, and geometric vs conventional miniplate) in the management of MAFs. The incidence of postoperative complications was analyzed. Only those studies in which a transoral approach had been used (with or without transbuccal instrumentation) were selected. Results: A total of 20 publications were included: 9 RCTs, 3 CCTs, and 8 retrospective studies. Eight studies had a low risk of bias, 11 studies a moderate risk of bias, and 1 a high risk of bias. A statistically significant difference was found between a single superior border miniplate and the use of 2 miniplates. The cumulative odds ratio (OR) was 0.63, indicating that the use of 1 miniplate in MAF fixation decreased the risk of postoperative complications by 37% compared with using 2 miniplates. Comparing a miniplate placed on the external oblique ridge to one placed on the lateral surface of the mandible resulted in a cumulative OR of 2.10, indicating that the use of the transbuccal miniplate decreased the risk of postoperative complications by 110% compared with a miniplate placed on the external oblique ridge. Comparing geometric and standard miniplates, the OR was 0.29, indicating that the use of a geometric miniplate decreased the risk of postoperative complications by 71% compared with using conventional miniplates. Conclusions: The results of the meta-analysis have shown that the use of 1 miniplate is superior to using 2 in reducing the incidence of postoperative complications in the management of MAFs. In addition, our results showed that the transbuccally placed lateral miniplate was better at reducing the incidence of postoperative complications than one placed on the external oblique ridge using a transoral approach. Finally, geometric miniplates performed better than conventional miniplates in reducing postoperative complications.

J	Ouyang, PR; Tan, QH; He, XJ; Zhao, B				Ouyang, Pengrong; Tan, Qinghua; He, Xijing; Zhao, Bo			Computational comparison of anterior lumbar interbody fusion and oblique lumbar interbody fusion with various supplementary fixation systems: a finite element analysis	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND RESEARCH			English	Article						Anterior lumbar interbody fusion; Oblique lumbar interbody fusion; Spinal internal fixation device; Biomechanical properties; Finite element analysis	STAND-ALONE ANTERIOR; PLATE; CAGE	Background and objective: Anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) and oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) have shown a great surgical potential, while it has always been controversial which surgical approach and which type of fixation system should be selected. This study investigated the biomechanical response of ALIF and OLIF with various supplementary fixation systems using the finite element method. Materials and methods: Lumbar L4-L5 ALIF and OLIF models stabilized by different supplementary fixation systems (stand-alone cage, integrated stand-alone cage, anterior plate, and bilateral pedicle screw) were developed to assess the segmental range of motion (ROM), endplate stress (EPS), and screw-bone interface stress (SBIS). Experimental results: ALIF showed lower ROM and EPS than OLIF in all motion planes and less SBIS in the most of motion planes compared with OLIF when the anterior plate or pedicle screw was used. ALIF induced higher ROM, while lower EPS and SBIS than OLIF in the majority of motion planes when integrated stand-alone cage was utilized. Using a stand-alone cage in ALIF and OLIF led to cage migration. Integrated stand-alone cage prevented the cage migration, whereas caused significantly larger ROM, EPS, and SBIS than other fixation systems except for the rotation plane. In the most of motion planes, the pedicle screw had the lowest ROM, EPS, and SBIS. The anterior plate induced a slightly larger ROM, EPS, and SBIS than the pedicle screw, while the differences were not significant. Conclusion: ALIF exhibited a better performance in postoperative segmental stability, endplate stress, and screw-bone interface stress than OLIF when the anterior plate or the pedicle screw was used. The pedicle screw could provide the greatest postoperative segmental stability, less cage subsidence incidence, and lower risk of fixation system loosening in ALIF and OLIF. The anterior plate could also contribute to the stability required and fewer complications, while not as effectively as the pedicle screw. Extreme caution should be regarded when the stand-alone cage is used due to the risk of cage migration. The integrated stand-alone cage may be an alternative method; however, further optimization is needed to reduce complications and improve postoperative segmental stability.

Does the PFNA™ nail limit impaction in unstable intertrochanteric femoral fracture? A 115 case-control series	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Intertrochanteric fracture; Internal fixation; ORIF unstable fracture; Secondary displacement; Fixation failure	SLIDING HIP SCREW; PERITROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; TROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; GAMMA-NAIL; FIXATION; ANTIROTATION; METAANALYSIS; REPRODUCIBILITY; ARTHROPLASTY; MORTALITY	Introduction: Femoral neck shortening after dynamic fixation of extra-capsular fracture may impair functional results, but is rarely assessed. The present study measured impaction in stable and unstable fractures (on the Ender classification) treated by PFNA (TM) nail. The objectives were: 1) to validate the Ender classification to assess fracture stability; 2) to determine whether neck shortening and head purchase quality varied with stability; and 3) to determine the functional impact of femoral neck shortening. Hypothesis: The study hypothesis was that the PFNA (TM) nail stabilizes unstable as well as stable fractures. Materials and Methods: One hundred and fifteen consecutive patients, aged over 70 years, operated on for intertrochanteric fracture using the PFNA (TM) nail were followed up prospectively for 6 months. Multivariate analysis, including age, gender, assembly quality and body-mass index, was applied to assess the predictive power of the Ender classification with respect to femoral neck shortening. Secondly, patients were grouped according to stable versus unstable fracture (n = 70 and 45, respectively), and impaction and femoral head purchase were assessed on a dedicated radiographic protocol. Functional results were assessed on Parker score. Results: In the unstable fracture group, 3 assembly failures required revision by total hip replacement. Ender grade >2 was significantly predictive of >5 mm neck shortening. Neck shortening was greater in unstable fracture: 8.1 +/- 8.4 mm (range, 4-32 mm), versus 2.5 +/- 3.7 mm (range, 3-14 mm) (P = 0.0004). Mean blade cut-through was 1.2 +/- 2.9 mm (range, 1-12 mm) in unstable fracture, versus 0.3 +/- 1.3 mm (range, 1-6 mm) (P = 0.02). Mean cut-out was 2.3 +/- 6 mm (range, 2-21 mm) in unstable fracture, versus 0.5 +/- 2.6 mm (range, 1-8 mm) (P = 0.03). Parker scores diminished comparably in the two groups, without significant difference at follow-up: 3.9 +/- 2.6 (range, 0-9) in stable and 3.1 +/- 1.9 (range, 0-8) in unstable fracture; reduction in Parker score showed no correlation with femoral neck shortening (r = 0.013, P = 0.88). Discussion: The PFNA (TM) nail provides poorer stabilization of unstable compared to stable fracture. Femoral neck shortening should be taken into account in assessing internal fixation hardware perfomances. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Materials and Methods: A total of 50 patients with a minimally displaced mandibular fracture were enrolled, with 25 patients randomly selected for each group. In group I (study group, n = 25), the patients were treated using IMFS, and in group II (control group, n = 25), they received eyelet interdental wiring. Both techniques were assessed for the following parameters: time required for placement and removal of each type of IMF technique, time required for placement of IMF wires, postoperative occlusion, stability of the IMF wire, local anesthesia requirement during removal of each fixation type, oral hygiene status, glove perforation rate, and complications associated with both techniques. The collected data were analyzed using Student's unpaired t test or chi(2) test. P < .05 was considered significant and the Statistical Package for Social Sciences software, version 10, was used for analysis. Results: The average time required for placement in groups I and II was 17.56 and 35.08 minutes, respectively (P = .000). The time required for placement of the IMF wire in group I was 2.1 minutes and in group II was 6 minutes. The oral hygiene status was assessed, and the mean plaque index score for groups I and II was 1.44 and 2.12, respectively (P = .00). The glove perforation rate was much less in group I than in group II. Finally, the most common complication in both groups was mucosal growth. Conclusions: The results established the supremacy of IMFS compared with eyelet interdental wiring. Thus, we have concluded that IMFS, in the present scenario, is a safe and time-saving technique. IMFS is a cost-effective, straightforward, and viable alternative to cumbersome eyelet interdental and other wiring techniques for providing IMF, with satisfactory occlusion during closed reduction or intraoperative open reduction internal fixation of fractures. In addition, oral hygiene can be maintained, and the glove perforation rate was very low using IMFS. The relatively small sample size and limited follow-up period were the study limitations.

This study shows the mid- to long-term clinical and radiological outcome after direct fixation of the posterior malleolus through a posterolateral approach. Materials and methods Thirty-six patients with an ankle fracture including a posterior malleolar fragment (23 x AO-44C, 12 x AO-44B, 1 x unclassifiable) treated with direct fixation of the fragment through a posterolateral approach were retrospectively evaluated. There were 24 females (67%) with a mean age of 63 (range 34-80) years and a BMI of 28 (range 19-41) kg/m(2)at the time of surgery. An initial fracture-dislocation was seen in 67%. The clinical outcome was assessed with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS, 0-10 points) and the American Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS, 0-100 points) score. Posttraumatic osteoarthritis was recorded with the Van Dijk Classification (grade 0-III). Subgroup analyses of patient- and fracture-associated risk factors (age, BMI, smoking, fracture-dislocation, postoperative articular step-off) were assessed to reveal possible negative prognostic predictors. Results After a mean follow-up of 7.9 (range 3-12) years, the median VAS was 1 (IQR 0-2) point, and the median AOFAS score was 96 (IQR 88-100) points. Ankle range of motion measurements showed a significant, but clinically irrelevant, difference in plantar- and dorsiflexion between the affected and unaffected ankle. 92% of the patients were very satisfied or satisfied with the postoperative course. 89% had no preoperative signs of ankle osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis progression was seen in 72%, with 50% showing grade II or III osteoarthritis at the final follow-up. No significant negative prognostic factors for a worse clinical outcome could be detected. Conclusion Direct fixation of posterior malleolar fractures through a posterolateral approach showed good clinical mid- to long-term results with a high satisfaction rate but substantial development of posttraumatic ankle osteoarthritis. Further studies should include CT analysis of the preoperative fracture morphology and even, perhaps, the postoperative reduction accuracy to evaluate the benefit of posterior malleolar fracture reduction in preventing ankle osteoarthritis in the long term.

In order to accurately assess the sacrum position relative to the pelvis, pelvic incidence (PI) is a commonly utilized radiographic parameter in sagittal view. This study aimed to investigate and compare the surgical outcomes and radiographic parameters of IS or TITS screw fixations for the treatment of posterior sacroiliac complex fractures with different PI values.Materials and methodsThe data on patients with posterior pelvic sacroiliac fractures who underwent percutaneous IS or TITS screw fixations, or both, at a single level I trauma center between January 2017 and June 2020 were reviewed. We documented the patient characteristics and fracture types, reviewed surgical records, and measured the radiographic parameters via plain films and multi-planar computed tomography (mpCT) images. Radiographic variations in PI, sacral slope, pelvic tilt, sacral dysmorphism, pelvic ring reduction quality, screw deviation angles, screw malposition grading, and iatrogenic complications were documented and analyzed.ResultsA total of 85 patients were included, and 65 IS and 70 TITS screws were accounted for. Patients were divided into two groups according to screw fixation method and further divided into four sub-groups based on baseline PI values. The PI cutoff values were 49.85 degrees and 48.05 degrees in the IS and TITS screw groups, respectively, according to receiver operating characteristic analysis and Youden's J statistic. Smaller PI values were significantly correlated with sacral dysmorphism (p = 0.027 and 0.003 in the IS and TITS screw groups, respectively). Patients with larger PI values were at a significantly increased risk of screw malposition in the TITS screw group (p = 0.049), with no association in the IS screw group. Logistic regression confirmed that a larger PI value was a significant risk factor for screw malposition in the TITS screw group (p = 0.010). The post-operative outcomes improved from poor/fair (at 6 months) to good/average (at 12 months) based on the Postel Merle d'Aubigne and Majeed scores, with no significant differences between subgroups.ConclusionsBoth percutaneous IS and TITS screw fixations are safe and effective treatments for posterior pelvic sacroiliac fractures. Due to the higher risk of screw malposition in patients with larger PI values, it is crucial to identify potential patients at risk when performing TITS screw fixation surgery.Level of evidence:Level III.

Because current fracture classifications do not take osteoporosis into account, a prospective radiological analysis was conducted of patients with hip and wrist fracture to evaluate the impact of osteoporosis oil fracture classification. Material/Methods:Altogether, 77 consecutive patients with either hip or wrist fracture were prospectively recruited within 24 hours of sustaining the fracture. The patients were assigned to subgroups according to gender, fracture site, fracture type, and bone mineral density (BMD). Using widely accepted classification systems for hip and wrist fractures, the impact of osteoporosis oil fracture classification was assessed. Results:Osteoporosis dominated in both fracture types and hone mineral density showed a significant negative correlation with age. Pertrochanteric fractures were more frequent, showing all equal distribution among severity grades, while less frequent femoral neck fractures were mainly unstable fractures. Postmenopausal patients sustained more severe intraarticular comminuted wrist fractures, which were not found rising the Fernandez classification. Conclusions:The contradiction between the higher incidence Nit lower severity of pertrochanteric fractures compared with femoral neck fractures in osteoporotic bone and inconsistencies between (lie classifications of wrist fractures may indicate incomplete fracture classification ill osteoporosis. Given the high incidence of osteoporotic fractures, incorporating hone mineral status into fracture classification systems may improve preoperative assessment, implant stability, and outcome.

Postoperative Monitoring of Distal Intraarticular Radial Fractures Treated with Osteosynthesis by means of Multislice CT	ROFO-FORTSCHRITTE AUF DEM GEBIET DER RONTGENSTRAHLEN UND DER BILDGEBENDEN VERFAHREN			English	Article						CT spiral; surgery; trauma; bones	EXTERNAL FIXATION; INTERNAL-FIXATION; COLLES FRACTURE; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; CLASSIFICATION; INTEROBSERVER; RADIOGRAPHY; RELIABILITY; PLACEMENT	Purpose: This study evaluates multislice CT (MSCT) for the postsurgical control of intraarticular fractures of the distal radius. Materials and Methods: In 131 patients conventional X-rays in two planes and MSCT were performed. In a consensus process two experienced radiologists judged conventional X-ray and computed tomography images in a random view. The correct position of the osteosynthetic material was assessed and it was ascertained whether an articular surface incongruity, a gap between two fracture fragments, or an intraarticular bone element was detectable. For each point of evaluation a confidence level of the evaluation was assessed on a five-point scale. Results: Ninety patients were classified as having correct alignment and osteosynthesis according to conventional X-ray, while when using the findings from axial CT scans only, 82 patients, and after the addition of multiplanar re-constructions (MPR) only 73 patients were found to have almost proper alignment and osteosynthesis. In 42 patients dehiscence of the fragments was diagnosed with MSCT, but was not visualized by Xray, leading to surgical revision in eight patients, confirming the diagnosis. In five patients an intraarticular position of intraarticular material was confirmed with MSCT and surgical revision. A significant advantage for the evaluation confidence level was achieved for MPRs in comparison with axial CT scans and X-ray. Conclusion: The marked diagnostic advantage with a high evaluation confidence level in comparison with conventional X-ray methods justify the use of MSCT during postoperative monitoring of articular radial fractures treated with osteosynthesis.

A mechanical study of novel additive manufactured modular mandible fracture fixation plates - Preliminary Study with finite element analysis	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Fixation plate; Mandible fracture; 3d printing; Finite element analysis	INTERNAL-FIXATION; STRESS; CONFIGURATIONS; DEFORMATION; REDUCTION	The paper presents an innovative osteofixation system designed for bone fracture stabilization. Its special feature, which makes it different from other similar systems, is the possibility to precisely adjust the implant to the shape of the bone. Such a precise adjustment is particularly important in the case of multiple fractures, where proper stabilization is a condition for restoring bone geometry and thus obtaining the biomechanical function of a given segment of the body lost due to fracture. Based on the tested properties of the implant material, the presented system structure was verified for loading, stress, and share forces in multi-site fractures of the mandible. Numerical tests were performed for three different fracture models: unilateral double fracture of the body of mandible, unilateral double fracture of the body and the angle of mandible, and bilateral fracture of the mandible at the angle and body of the mandible. The results indicate that the proposed system may be used to stabilize broken bone fragments successfully, and the obtained stabilization would allow unrestricted use of the chewing function during bone healing and remodeling. The authors point out the advantages of the proposed implantation method thanks to which it is possible to obtain any shape of the implant and thus stabilize bone fragments in any case.

Materials and Methods: A prospective, nonrandomized comparative study was conducted in 50 patients with age <12 years, presenting with displaced fracture of lateral condyle of humerus of <2 weeks duration, without associated ipsilateral upper limb injury, who were treated by open reduction and internal fixation with either exposed or buried K-wires (n = 25 in each group). At a minimum followup of 3 months, status of fracture reduction, union, evidence of osteomyelitis, carrying angle at the elbow, and elbow range of motion (ROM) were assessed clinicoradiologically. Results: Four (16%) patients in exposed group and 1 (4%) in buried group had superficial infection, while 3 (12%) patients in exposed group and 2 (8%) in buried group had deep infection. All the patients with infection responded well to oral antibiotics and regular dressings. Buried group had higher incidence of secondary skin and wire-related complications. Conclusion: There was no statistical difference between the two groups but exposed K wires are easy to remove so are preferred over buried K wires.

Computer tomography assessment of pedicle screw placement in thoracic spine: comparison between free hand and a generic 3D-based navigation techniques	EUROPEAN SPINE JOURNAL			English	Article						Pedicle screws; Thoracic spine Image-guided surgery; Spine navigation	IMAGE GUIDANCE; ACCURACY; INSERTION; FIXATION; SYSTEM	Although pedicle screw fixation is a well-established technique for the lumbar spine, screw placement in the thoracic spine is more challenging because of the smaller pedicle size and more complex 3D anatomy. The intraoperative use of image guidance devices may allow surgeons a safer, more accurate method for placing thoracic pedicle screws while limiting radiation exposure. This generic 3D imaging technique is a new generation intraoperative CT imaging system designed without compromise to address the needs of a modern OR. The aim of our study was to check the accuracy of this generic 3D navigated pedicle screw implants in comparison to free hand technique described by Roy-Camille at the thoracic spine using CT scans. The material of this study was divided into two groups: free hand group (group I) (18 patients; 108 screws) and 3D group (27 patients; 100 screws). The patients were operated upon from January 2009 to March 2010. Screw implantation was performed during internal fixation for fractures, tumors, and spondylodiscitis of the thoracic spine as well as for degenerative lumbar scoliosis. The accuracy rate in our work was 89.8 % in the free hand group compared to 98 % in the generic 3D navigated group. In conclusion, 3D navigation-assisted pedicle screw placement is superior to free hand technique in the thoracic spine.

Stability of Open Bite Correction With Sagittal Split Osteotomy and Closing Rotation of the Mandible	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							SURGICAL-ORTHODONTIC CORRECTION; ANTERIOR OPEN-BITE; RIGID FIXATION; ADVANCEMENT; SKELETAL; RAMUS; EXPERIENCE; DEFORMITY; SURGERY; RELAPSE	Purpose: To determine the long-term stability of bilateral sagittal split osteotomies with counterclockwise (closing) rotation of the mandible combined with rigid internal fixation in the correction of anterior open bite deformities. Materials and Methods: A total of 28 patients who had completed orthodontic therapy and had at least 1 year of postoperative follow-up were evaluated using cephalometric analysis for dental and skeletal changes. We evaluated 7 angular and 6 linear measurements cephalometrically at 3 points for each patient: immediately preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, and after a minimum of 1 year of postoperative follow-up. Results: Of the 28 patients, 12 exhibited some degree of opening rotation (range 1% to 64%, mean 16%), and 16 showed no open rotation or continued to experience bite closure. However, all patients had a positive overbite at 1 year of follow-up, indicating that even though skeletal relapse was observed postoperatively, dental compensation resulted in the maintenance of the occlusal relationships. Conclusions: Bilateral sagittal split osteotomies and closing rotation of the mandible using rigid fixation is a relatively stable procedure and a viable surgical treatment option for the correction of anterior open bite in instances in which maxillary osteotomies are not indicated to improve or enhance facial esthetics.

The fracture often extends into the trochlea and is associated with posterior comminution of the humerus and soft tissue injury. Diverse fixation techniques are required to restore the anatomy perfectly to ensure elbow function is regained. Materials and methods: This study presents the results of treatment of 26 patients followed up prospectively and treated within a week of injury. Clinical and radiographic evaluations were done annually by an independent reviewer, and the Mayo Elbow Performance Index (MEPI) was calculated. Results: Results were excellent in 9 patients, good in 9, and fair in 8 when assessed at an average of 46 months (range, 19-94 months) postoperatively using the MEPI, which averaged 81.3 (range 65-100). The poorer results occurred in patients with severe injuries associated with posterior comminution of the humerus and who required more extensive reconstructive procedures. All pain scores improved significantly and activities of daily living were restored in all groups, All returned to employment within 6 months, but 6 (3 type 2 and 3 type 3) had altered their roles from manual to administrative work. Conclusion: This series reflects the challenges in reconstructing precisely this cartilage-covered sphere, especially when there are multiple fragments. Modern techniques of fracture stabilization that concentrate on restoring a circular structure may require a different approach and engineering solutions.

ANALYSIS OF AN INTERNAL FIXATION OF A LONG BONE FRACTURE	JOURNAL OF MECHANICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Bone fracture; modulus; stress shielding; stiffness graded material; finite element analysis		A major concern when a fractured bone is fastened by stiff-plates to the bone on its tensile surface is excessive stress shielding of the bone. The compressive stress shielding at the fracture-interface immediately after fracture-fixation delays bone healing. Likewise, the tensile stress shielding of the healed bone underneath the plate also does not enable it to recover its tensile strength. Initially, the effect of a uniaxial load and a bending moment on the assembly of bone and plate is investigated analytically. The calculations showed that the screws near the fracture site transfers more load than the screws away from the fracture site in axial loading and it is found that less force is required when the screw is placed near to fracture site than the screw placed away from the fracture site to make the bone and plate bend with same radius of curvature when subjected to bending moment. Finally, the viability of using a stiffness graded bone-plate as a fixator is studied using finite element analysis (FEA): the stiffness-graded plate cause less stress-shielding than stainless steel plate.

Stereotactic CT-guided percutaneous stabilization of posterior pelvic ring fractures: A preclinical cadaver study	JOURNAL OF VASCULAR AND INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY			English	Article							ILIOSACRAL SCREW PLACEMENT; INTERNAL-FIXATION; SACROILIAC SCREWS; NAVIGATION SYSTEM; SACRAL FRACTURES; EXPERIENCES; INSERTION; JOINT; DISRUPTIONS; FLUOROSCOPY	PURPOSE: To determine the accuracy of frameless stereotactic computed tomographic (CT)-guided wire placement for percutaneous fixation of posterior pelvic ring fractures in human cadavers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four intact human cadavers were fixated in a double-vacuum immobilization system. A 2.5-mm helical CT dataset was obtained and transferred to the three-dimensional (3D) navigation system. In every specimen, two paths on each side (total number, 16) were defined on multiplanar reconstructions of the 3D CT datasets, simulating fixation of the iliosacral joint. An aiming device was adjusted according to the plan, and a 2.5-mm pin was advanced through the aiming device to the precalculated target point. To determine the accuracy of pin placement, a control CT scan was co-registered to the planning CT scan (with the planned trajectories). The distance between the planned and achieved positions of the pins (3D accuracy) was calculated in millimeters. RESULTS: The mean 3D accuracy was 1.84 mm +/- 0.9 (standard deviation) at the bone entrance point and 2.5 mm +/- 1.2 at the target, as determined with image fusion between the planning CT scan and the control CT scan with the pins in place. CONCLUSIONS: The described technique enables accurate placement of pins in the pelvis and may be useful for percutaneous orthopedic procedures.

The implant design and material as well as implantation technique play an important role in the pathogenesis of local infection. The aim of our study was to determine if the local resistance to infection of a cannulated IM nail is less than that of a solid nail and more similar to that of a hollow nail. In 65 female White Zealand rabbits, the intramedullary cavity was inoculated with matching concentrations of Staphylococcus aureus, and one of the three nails was inserted. The solid nail had a greater than twofold higher resistance to infection (23%) compared to that of the other two nails (hollow, 65%; cannulated, 61%) which was statistically significant (p < 0.02). No difference in infection resistance was detected between the hollow slotted and cannulated nail designs (p = 1). Although these experimental results may be clinically considered, direct extrapolation to clinical infection rates is ill advised. (c) 2004 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Biomechanical comparison of strategies to adjust axial stiffness of a hybrid fixator	VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ORTHOPAEDICS AND TRAUMATOLOGY			English	Article						External skeletal fixation; hybrid fixation; biomechanical properties	ILIZAROV EXTERNAL FIXATOR; MECHANICAL PERFORMANCE; TIBIAL FRACTURES; SKELETAL FIXATOR; PROXIMAL TIBIA; DOGS; CONSTRUCTS	Objectives: To evaluate strategies for increasing the axial stiffness of a hybrid external bone fixator. Materials and methods: Type la hybrid fixators, consisting of a uniplanar linear component connected to a circular ring, were tested in displacement controlled loading in axial compression. The basic hybrid construct was modified to explore strategies considered to increase fixator stiffness including: decreasing ring diameter, increasing ring thickness, adding pins to the ring fixation, and adding struts between the ring and vertical post components of the device. Stiffness in the initial phase of loading was compared between the groups. Results: The addition of a single diagonal bar between the ring and linear connecting rail did not significantly improve the stiffness of constructs. However, the addition of two half-pins to the ring, the addition of two struts between the ring and linear connecting rail, or decreasing the internal ring diameter from 115 to 85 mm progressively increased the stiffness of the frame. The most effective strategy consisted of increasing the thickness of the ring from 6 to 12 mm, thereby increasing the stiffness of the control frame by 335%. Clinical significance: Modulating the ring thickness, adding two struts between the ring and linear connecting rail, and reducing the ring diameter appear to be the most effective, simple, and clinically versatile ways to increase axial stiffness, most likely due to their impact on reducing ring bending.

Comparable results using 2.0-mm vs. 3.5-mm screw augmentation in midshaft clavicle fractures: a 10-year experience	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Clavicle; Fracture; Plate; Screw; Osteosynthesis; Cortical; Alignment		Purpose Absence of cortical alignment in wedge-shaped and multifragmentary fractures (Fx) results in decreased fixation stability. The aim of this study was to compare the outcome using 2.0- vs. 3.5-mm screws for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) in dislocated, wedge-shaped or fragmentary midshaft clavicle fractures. Materials and methods Patients suffering from AO/OTA 15 2.A-C midshaft clavicle fractures were operatively treated between 2008 and 2018. 2.0- or 3.5-mm cortical screws were used to restore anatomic alignment in dislocated, wedge-shaped and fragmentary clavicle fractures. Data of radiologic outcome were collected until fracture consolidation was identified. Results 80 consecutive patients with a mean age of 44.5 +/- 16.3 years, who were operatively treated for dislocated midshaft clavicle fractures were enrolled. 40 patients were treated using 2.0-mm and 40 patients using routine 3.5-mm cortical screws, respectively. Time to fracture consolidation was 12.8 +/- 7.8 months. No mal- or non-unions occurred during routine follow-up until 18 months postoperatively. Conclusion Restoring anatomic alignment in wedge or fragmentary clavicle fractures can ultimately be addressed using cortical screw augmentation. Both groups showed comparable results with respect to fracture reduction, fixation and stability as well as time to consolidation of the fracture, while the 2.0-mm screw diameter was associated with easier handling of small Fx fragments.

Many treatment modalities have been described with their own merits and demerits. Stabilization of ulnocarpal articulation is an effective method to prevent radial collapse during healing, and hence this study. Materials and Methods : A prospective study of 200 patients of comminuted intraarticular fracture lower end radius between 20-75 years of age irrespective of sex, treated by closed reduction and percutaneous stabilization of ulnocarpal articulation and a well-molded above elbow POP cast for 6 weeks has been presented. Patients were evaluated at 1 year follow-up and functionally by Sarmientos modification of Lindstrom criteria and Gartland and Werleys criteria. Results : Excellent to good results were seen in 92, fair in 6 and poor in 2 of the cases. Complications observed were, pintract infection ( n = 6), malunion ( n = 6), subluxation of the inferior radioulnar joint ( n = 4) Sudecks osteodystrophy ( n = 3) and post-traumatic arthritis of the wrist ( n = 3). Conclusion: Percutaneous fixation by this technique is an effective method to maintain the reduction, prevent radial collapse during healing, and to maintain the stability of the distal radioulnar joint even when the fracture is grossly comminuted, intraarticular, or unstable.

Materials and methods: Twenty-one patients with a hamatometacarpal fracture-dislocation were enrolled in this study. The classification scheme devised for hamatometacarpal fracture-dislocation is summarised as follows: type I - a simple dislocation; type IIA - a dislocation with the fourth metacarpal base intra-articular fracture; type IIB - a dislocation with a dorsal hamate fracture of less than one-third of the articular surface; and type III - a dislocation with a dorsal hamate fracture of more than one-third of the articular surface. Results: Type I injury was treated conservatively after closed reduction. Type IIA and IIB injuries were treated by percutaneous K-wire fixation. Type III injury was treated by open reduction and internal fixation. All injuries were well managed in both clinical and radiographic evaluations, without apparent complications. Conclusion: The novel classification system for hamatometacarpal fracture-dislocation can be used to establish guidelines for appropriate treatment. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Intramedullary Nailing for the Treatment of Dislocated Pediatric Radial Neck Fractures	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY			English	Article						children; radial neck fractures; intramedullary nailing	CLOSED REDUCTION; PROXIMAL RADIUS; CHILDREN; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; PROGNOSIS	Introduction: Pediatric radial neck fractures represent 5-10% of all elbow fractures. Open reduction allows anatomic fracture fixation but compromises the vulnerable blood supply of the radial head. Intramedullary nailing combines the advantages of closed reduction and stable internal fracture fixation. Material and Methods: During a 6-year-period the medical records of all children sustaining a radial neck fracture treated operatively at our institution were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Forty-two patients with dislocated fractures of the radial neck were treated with intramedullary nailing. The average age of the patients was 8 years. Thirty-eight patients (90%) could be treated with closed fracture reduction and retrograde nailing. Open fracture reduction was required in 4 (10%) patients, and in 2 patients necrosis of the radial head occurred. Loss of reduction was seen in 7 (17%) patients. Excellent results were found in 38 patients, good results in 2 patients, and poor results in another 2. Conclusion: The retrograde nailing technique for the treatment of dislocated fractures of the radial neck in pediatric patients is a simple, short and safe procedure.

However, OLIF at the L5-S1 level (OLIF51) is technically difficult because of the anatomical structures. We present a novel simultaneous technique of OLIF51 with percutaneous pedicle screw fixation without fluoroscopy. The patient is placed in a right lateral decubitus position. A percutaneous reference pin is inserted into the right sacroiliac joint. An O-arm scan is performed, and 3D reconstructed images are transmitted to the spinal navigation system. A 4 cm oblique skin incision is made under navigation guidance along the pelvis. The internal/ external and transverse abdominal muscles are divided along the muscle fibers, protecting the iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves. Using a retroperitoneal approach, the left common iliac vessels are identified. Special muscle retractors with illumination are used to expose the L5-S1 intervertebral disc. After disc preparation with navigated instruments, the disc space is distracted with navigated trials. Autogenous bone and demineralized bone material are then inserted into the cage hole. The OLIF51 cage is inserted into the disc space with the help of a mallet. Simultaneously, percutaneous pedicle screws are inserted by another surgeon without changing the lateral decubitus position of the patient. In conclusion, C-arm-free OLIF51 and simultaneous percutaneous pedicle screw fixation are performed in a lateral position under navigation guidance. This novel technique reduces surgical time and radiation hazards.

The aim of this work was to evaluate results of this unknown manual reduction method. Materials and Methods: A total of 184 patients were reviewed. We recorded epidemiology of mandible fracture. clinical and radiologic evaluation before and after Surgery, and treatment. Anatomic and functional manual reductions were the basic principle, manual maxillomandibular immobilization (functional) and manual fracture reduction (anatomic). In cases of condylar fractures Without severe displacement, MMF with cortical hone screws was indicated (orthopedic treatment). Physiotherapy was also possible (functional treatment). Results: In all, 315 mandible fractures Sustained by 184 patients were reviewed into the study. Of the patients, 80% were treated by osteosynthesis 54% by osteosynthesis treatment alone, 26% by osteosynthesis and orthopedic treatments. The average time required for osteosynthesis or osteosynthesis and orthopedic treatment was 56 minutes We observed 0 67% Of disturbed occlusion, 0.67% of pseudarthrosis, and 0 67% of bilateral temporomandibular joint internal derangement. Conclusions: Manual fracture reduction Suppresses systematic MMF using arch bars during osteosynthesis of mandible fractures Operating time and risk Of complications are reduced.

A two-center study was performed to understand the effects of naturalness of the nose on the aesthetic satisfaction of patients. Long-term follow-up results for 24 patients who underwent saddle nose correction with alloplastic materials (endonasal approach, group 1) in a state hospital were compared with the results for 29 patients who underwent a "calvarial bone graft" (autograft; group 2) at another hospital in terms of aesthetic results. With this aim, a questionnaire was designed to assess the patients' degree of aesthetic satisfaction with different aspects. The significance of the results was tested using dependent or independent sample t tests. Nasolabial angles were greater (meaning near to normal range) in group 2 than in group 1 in both males and females (P < 0.001). Nasofacial angles were also greater in group 2 than in group 1 in both males and females (P < 0.001). This situation causes discomfort in patients. However, in patients with the autogenous calvarial bone graft as the autograft, this uncomfortable situation was not observed; it was also not experienced in patients with alloplastic grafts. Although donor areas were left in their bodies, most patients were satisfied with this operation. They feel there are no foreign bodies in them. On the other hand, materials used to correct their nose have been taken from their own bodies.

Internal fixation of fractures of both bones forearm: Comparison of locked compression and limited contact dynamic compression plate	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Diaphyseal forearm fractures; limited contact dynamic compression plate; locking compression plate; plate fixation; radius and ulna	DIAPHYSEAL FRACTURES; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; RADIUS; REFRACTURE	Background: The locking compression plate (LCP) with combination holes is a newer device in fracture fixation. We undertook a study comparing the LCP with limited contact dynamic compression plate (LC-DCP) in the treatment of diaphyseal fractures of both bones of the forearm. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective comparative study, 36 patients (18 in each group) with fractures of both the forearm bones (72 fractures) were treated with one of the two devices. The average age of the patients was 30.5 years (range 16-60 years) with mean followup of 2.1 years (range 1.5-2.8 years). The patients were assessed for fracture union and function and complications and by Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score for patient related outcome at the latest followup. Results: There was no significant difference in two groups with respect to the range of movements or grip strength. One case had delayed union (LC-DCP group) and another had synostosis (LCP group). Plate removal was done in four cases within the study period with no refracture till the presentation of this report. Conclusion: LC plating is an effective treatment option for fractures of both bones of forearm. The present study could not prove its superiority over LC-DCP.	[Saikia, K. C.; Bhuyan, S.

Functional results after conservative treatment of fractures of the mandibular condyle	BRITISH JOURNAL OF ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article						condylar fractures; mandibular condyle (MESH); treatment (MESH); non-surgical; Helkimo; index and outcome	CLOSED TREATMENT; REDUCTION; OCCLUSAL; FIXATION	Since the introduction of osteosynthesis materials for rigid internal fixation after anatomical reduction there is an ongoing discussion about the treatment of condylar fractures of the mandible. Sixty patient files were analyzed and 28 patients were seen for re-examination and a x-orthopantomogram was taken. Functionality was graded with the Helkimo index at an average of 3.0 years follow-up. The clinical dysfunction index showed: severe symptoms in 11%, moderate symptoms in 39%, mild symptoms in 39% and 11% had no symptoms. Index for occlusal state showed: 21% severe occusal disturbances, 61% moderate occlusal disturbances and 18% no occlusal disturbances. According to the anamnestic dysfunction index 89% of the patients were symptom-free. The clinical outcome group showed a significant left/right ramus length difference compared with a 20-person control group. The re-examined group did not significantly differ from the control group. Conservative treatment for condylar fractures was successful in only 46% according to the 1999 consensus criteria described by Bos et al.

Material and methodsWe systematically summarized and compared results of different fixation techniques in the management of acute distal femur fractures above a total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Several databases were searched (Medline, Cochrane library, OTA and AAOS abstract databases) and baseline and outcome parameters were abstracted. Results We extracted data from 29 case series with a total of 415 fractures. The following outcomes were noted: a nonunion rate of 9%, a fixation failure rate of 4%, an infection rate of 3%, and a revision surgery rate of 13%. Retrograde nailing was associated with relative risk reduction (RRR) of 87% (p = 0.01) for developing a nonunion and 70% (p = 0.03) for requiring revision surgery compared to traditional (non-locking) plating methods. Point estimates also suggested risk reductions for locking plates, although these were not statistically significant (57% for nonunion, p = 0.2; 43% for revision surgery, p = 0.23) compared to traditional plating. RRRs for nonunion and revision surgery were also statistically significantly lower for retrograde nailing and locking plates compared to nonoperative treatment. Interpretation Modern-day treatment methods are superior to conventional treatment options in the management of distal femur fractures above TKAs. The results should be interpreted with caution, due to the lack of randomized controlled trials and the possible selection bias in case series.

The ceramic screw had been used for the fixation of a bone graft and reattachment of the greater trochanter in the primary THA. Scanning electron microscope analysis revealed large alumina ceramic particles embedded on the bearing surface of the polyethylene. It has previously been pointed out that metallosis of an inner head occurred in bipolar case due to a fracture of the ceramic screws in contact with a proximally migrated outer head. However, this case showed that if a ceramic screw fragmented even though it was used outside of the hip joint, the fragments could migrate into bearing surface and cause serious metallosis of the metal head. Thus, we recommend that surgeons should pay special attention to the radiographic signs of ceramic failure or metallosis such as a change of the metal head contour, if an aseptic loosening or severe osteolysis is observed in a THA in which ceramic materials were used near the hip joint. And, when a surgical revision is planned, the surgeon should be prepared to exchange with a new ceramic head.

Medial malleolar stress fracture secondary to chronic ankle impingement	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						stress fracture; medial malleolus; impingement; arthroscopy; internal fixation	ANTERIOR IMPINGEMENT; ARTHROSCOPIC TREATMENT; INJURIES; SCINTIGRAPHY; EXOSTOSES; SOCCER; SPURS; TALUS; FOOT; BONE	Background: Medial malleolar stress fractures are uncommon even in the sporting population. We believe that stress fractures of the medial malleolus may be the end stage of chronic anteromedial ankle impingement in elite running and jumping athletes. Materials and Methods: We present five cases of elite athletes who presented to our institution with stress fractures of the medial malleolus over a 3-year period (2004 to 2007). In each case preoperative imaging revealed an anteromedial bony spur on the tibia. All fractures were internally fixed and at the same sitting had arthroscopic debridement of the bony spur. Results: All fractures united without further intervention, average time to union was 10.2 (range, 6 to 16) weeks. At most recent review (average, 18 months; range, 8 to 37 months), all patients had resumed sporting activity to their previous level. No patient had suffered a recurrent fracture of the medial malleolus. Conclusion: We believe this region of impingement to be important in the development of the stress fracture and should be addressed at the time of fracture fixation.	[Jowett, Andrew J.

Semiautomatic registration of digital histopathology images to in vivo MR images in molded and unmolded prostates	JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING			English	Article						histopathology; registration; prostate cancer; MRI	DEFORMABLE REGISTRATION; MUTUAL INFORMATION; TISSUE-SHRINKAGE; CANCER; HISTOLOGY; SPECIMENS; COILS	Purpose To evaluate a semiautomatic software-based method of registering in vivo prostate MR images to digital histopathology images using two approaches: (i) in which the prostates were molded to simulate distortion due to the endorectal imaging coil before fixation, and (ii) in which the prostates were not molded. Materials and Methods T2-weighted MR images and digitized whole-mount histopathology images were acquired for 26 patients with biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy. Ten excised prostates were molded before fixation. A semiautomatic method was used to align MR images to histopathology. Percent overlap between MR and histopathology images, as well as distances between corresponding anatomical landmarks were calculated and used to evaluate the registration technique for molded and unmolded cases. Results The software successfully morphed histology-based prostate images into corresponding MR images. Percent overlap improved from 80.4 +/- 5.8% before morphing to 99.7 +/- 0.62% post morphing. Molded prostates had a smaller distance between landmarks (1.91 +/- 0.75 mm) versus unmolded (2.34 +/- 0.68 mm), P < 0.08. Conclusion Molding a prostate before fixation provided a better alignment of internal structures within the prostate, but this did not reach statistical significance. Software-based morphing allowed for nearly complete overlap between the pathology slides and the MR images. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2014;39:1223-1229. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Reactive dyeings are one of the most serious pollution sources and few dyeing technologies developed could successfully reduce the generation of toxic substances without decreasing dyeing qualities. Through a remarkable increase in chemical potential of dyes in dyeing medium, SWDS remarkably increased the dye concentration in the internal solvent phase. As a result, % exhaustion of dye was 100%, and % fixation of dye was up to 92% in SWDS. Final discharges of dyes and salts from SWDS were decreased by 85% and 100%, respectively, compared to that from the conventional aqueous system. More than 99.5% of initially added biodegradable soybean oil could be recycled for reactive dyeing without treatments. Furthermore, SWDS could be readily applied in jet-dyeing machines on a pilot scale. Via the reuse of soybean oil, SWDS could save up to $0.26 per kg of fabric compared to aqueous dyeings in terms of materials cost.

In this study, to investigate the usefulness of this composite as a scaffold loaded with cells, we estimated whether this material showed osteogenesis on implantation to extraosseous site. On loading With syngeneic bone marrow cells and implantation into rat dorsal subcutaneous tissue, osteogenesis with enchondral ossification was seen both on and in the material at 3 weeks after implantation. The osteogenesis in the u-HA/PDLLA had progressed, and newly formed bone tissue was found in the material by 6 weeks. To investigate the osteoinductive properties of the material, we implanted this porous composite material into extraosseous canine dorsal muscle. At 8 weeks, osteogenesis was seen in the pores of the material. Newly formed bone could be observed adjacent to the material. In addition, cuboidal osteoblasts adjacent to the newly formed bone were evident. Neither cartilage nor chondrocytes were found. These results might indicate that the material induced osteogenesis by intramembranous ossification. Conversely, similar porous PDLLA did not induce osteogenesis during the observation period. Therefore, porous HA/PDLLA, which has osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties, might be a useful material for use as a bone substitute and cellular scaffold. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Comparison of risk factors for postoperative complications across age groups in patients undergoing ORIF of the ankle	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Ankle fractures; Adverse outcomes; Risk factors; Age	OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP-APNEA; INTERNAL-FIXATION; FRACTURES; ASSOCIATION; OUTCOMES; SURGERY	Introduction: Risk factors associated with various adverse outcomes for patients undergoing open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the ankle, and how these risks differ between younger and older patient populations, has not been clearly established. Objective quantitative data may aid physicians in surgical decision making, individualizing postoperative management, and targeting interventions for reducing postoperative comorbidity. The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of and risk factors for adverse postoperative outcomes following ORIF of ankle fractures across patient age groups. Materials and methods: Charts of patients age 18 years and older who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for any closed, non-polytraumatic, non-pilon ankle fracture at a single institution between the years 2008 and 2018 were reviewed. Demographic information, comorbidities, and postoperative outcomes were collected. Relative risks for adverse outcomes were calculated and compared between patients younger than 50 and patients 50 years and older. Results: A total of 886 patients were included, 375 (42.3%) of which were over age 50. In both age groups, risk of infection was significantly increased among patients with hypertension, although risk among older patients (RR = 3.52, p = 0.004) was greater than that among younger patients (RR = 2.46, p = 0.017). In patients younger than 50, significant risk of wound dehiscence was associated with tobacco use (RR = 3.39, p = 0.022), substance use (RR = 3.07, p = 0.020), and CHF (RR = 12.77, p < 0.001). Risk of implant failure was significantly increased among younger patients with HIV (RR = 4.33, p = 0.026), CHF (RR = 10.54, p < 0.001), and CKD (RR = 10.54, p < 0.001), and among older patients with HTN (RR = 4.51, p = 0.006), CHF (RR = 5.83, p < 0.001), and tobacco use (RR = 3.82, P = 0.001). Conclusion: Patients undergoing ORIF of the ankle should be well-informed of the potential risks of surgery as they pertain to specific comorbidities. Multidisciplinary approaches are warranted for appropriate management of patients with multiple comorbidities. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nonoperative, open reduction and internal fixation or primary arthrodesis in the treatment of Lisfranc injuries: a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial - study protocol	BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS			English	Article						Lisfranc; Conservative treatment; Operative treatment ORIF; Arthrodesis	TARSOMETATARSAL JOINT; FRACTURE-DISLOCATIONS; MIDFOOT SPRAINS; MANAGEMENT; ANKLE; FOOT; CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS; TARSAL; HALLUX	Background: Lisfranc injuries are known to be rare and often overlooked injuries that can cause long-term disability and pain when missed or treated incorrectly. The wide variety of Lisfranc injuries ranges from subtle ligament distensions to open fracture dislocations. The treatment of Lisfranc joint injuries is still controversial and very little is known about what types of injury can be treated nonoperatively. The current literature provides only two randomized studies on dislocated Lisfranc injuries. These studies have shown that primary arthrodesis (PA) leads to a similar or better outcome and results in fewer secondary operations when compared with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) in ligamentous injuries. There have been no previous randomized studies of the nonoperative versus operative treatment of Lisfranc injuries. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare the operative and nonoperative treatment of non-dislocated Lisfranc injuries and to compare the ORIF and PA treatment of dislocated Lisfranc injuries. Methods: This study is a prospective, randomized, national multi-center trial. The trial comprises two strata: Stratum I compares cast-immobilization versus open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) treatment of non-dislocated Lisfranc joint injuries. Stratum II compares PA versus ORIF in the treatment of dislocated injuries of the Lisfranc joint The main hypothesis of stratum I is that the nonoperative treatment of non-dislocated Lisfranc injuries achieves a similar outcome compared with operative treatment (ORIF). The hypothesis of stratum II is that PA of dislocated Lisfranc injuries yields a similar functional outcome compared with ORIF, but that PA results in fewer secondary operations than ORIF. The main outcome measure is the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Midfoot score and the secondary outcome measures are Visual-Analogue-Scale Foot and Ankle (VAS-FA), VisualAnalogue-Scale (VAS), rate of secondary operations and other treatment-related complications. The results will be analyzed after the 2-year follow-up period. Discussion: This publication presents a prospective, randomized, national multi-center trial study protocol. It provides details of patient flow, randomization, aftercare and methods of analysis of the material and ways to present and publish the results.

The present study sought to identify factors for success or failure of internal fixation according to: 1) initial treatment; 2) initial reduction quality; and 3) population characteristics. Hypothesis: The study hypothesis was that population, fracture type, initial treatment and reduction quality can predict survival. Material and methods: A retrospective study included all cases of femoral neck fracture in under 65-years-old treated by screwing in our center: i.e., 112 patients. Patient characteristics, time to surgery were collated; surviving patients were followed up at a minimum 24 months. Reduction quality was assessed on X-rays in 3 dimensions and cervico-diaphyseal angle. Results: Mean follow-up was 5.3 +/- 3.0 years [range, 2.0-13.6 years]. At 2 years, 23 of the 112 patients (20.5%) had developed complications: 10 osteonecroses (8.9%) and 13 non-unions (11.6%). Known hip osteonecrosis risk factors showed no significant association with survival. Failure rates were significantly higher in unstable (Garden >= 3) than stable (Garden <= 2) fracture: HR = 2.77 [95%CI: 1.09-7.02]; p = 0.025. There was no significant association with time to treatment (<= 6 hours): HR = 1.08 [95%CI: 0.46-2.54]; p = 0.86. On 2-year radiographs, mean shortening on the z-axis was 12.3 +/- 4.8 mm [-0.7 to 26.2], 8.5 +/- 5.0 mm [-6.8 to 23.9] on the x-axis, and 6.4 +/- 6.1 mm [-6.3 to 25.3] on they-axis. There was a significant negative correlation between z shortening and HOOS pain component (r = -0.38; p = 0.005), a non-significant negative correlation with quality of life (r = -0.20; p = 0.16), and a significant negative correlation with sports activity (r = -0.28; p = 0.039). Conclusion: The present series showed lower rates of complications and of arthroplasty than in the literature. Internal fixation seemed to be indicated even at an interval of 6 hours or more.

Fresh fish scales were decellularized and characterized to provide higher biocompatibility. The mechanical properties of fish scales were tested, and the microstructure of an acellular fish scale was examined. The growth curve of a myoblastic cell line (C2C12), which was cultured on the acellular fish scales, implied biocompatibility in vitro, and the morphology of the cells cultured on the scales was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A bone pin made of decellularized fish scales was used for the internal fixation of femur fractures in New Zealand rabbits. Periodic X-ray evaluations were obtained, and histologic examinations were performed postoperatively. The present results show good cell growth on decellularized fish scales, implying great biocompatibility in vitro. Using SEM, the cell morphology revealed great adhesion on a native, layered collagen structure. The Young's modulus was 332 +/- 50.4 MPa and the tensile strength was 34.4 +/- 6.9 MPa for the decellularized fish scales. Animal studies revealed that a fish-scale-derived bone pin improved the healing of bone fractures and degraded with time. After an 8-week implantation, the bone pin integrated with the adjacent tissue, and new extracellular matrix was synthesized around the implant. Our results proved that fish-scale-derived bone pins are a promising implant material for bone healing and clinical applications.

The Importance of Sufficient Graft Material in Achieving Foot or Ankle Fusion	JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME			English	Article							AUTOGENOUS BONE-GRAFT; RETROGRADE INTRAMEDULLARY NAIL; TIBIOTALOCALCANEAL ARTHRODESIS; SUBTALAR ARTHRODESIS; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; FLATFOOT DEFORMITY; HINDFOOT FUSIONS; PROXIMAL TIBIA; RHPDGF-BB; FIXATION	Background: Nonunion, an important complication following foot and ankle arthrodesis, causes substantial morbidity and disability. In patients undergoing hindfoot and ankle arthrodesis, autogenous bone graft (autograft) or a suitable alternative is often used to promote osseous fusion across the joint. This study assessed the importance of adequate graft material in the fusion space to achieve joint fusion during ankle and hindfoot arthrodesis. Methods: This study used data from a previously published clinical trial of grafting material (recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB with beta-tricalcium phosphate [rhPDGF-BB/beta-TCP] or autograft) for healing in hindfoot and ankle arthrodesis to correlate the amount of graft fill at 9 weeks with ultimate healing. Patients who received supplemental graft material for ankle or hindfoot arthrodesis for end-stage ankle or hindfoot arthritis were stratified according to nonunion risk factors and surgical fusion site. Patients underwent arthrodesis using standard rigid internal fixation. Graft fill was defined as "adequate" if the material occupied >= 50% of the cross-sectional area of the fusion space on a computed tomography (CT) scan made at 9 weeks. Fusion was defined as osseous bridging of >= 50% of each articulation on a CT scan made at 24 weeks. Three hundred and seventy-nine patients with 573 joints (383 managed with rhPDGF-BB/b-TCP and 190 managed with autograft) that underwent arthrodesis had complete follow-up with 9-week and 24-week CT scans available. Results: Overall, 472 (82%) of 573 joints had adequate graft fill; of those, 383 (81%) were successfully fused at 24 weeks compared with 21 (21%) of 101 joints without adequate graft fill (p < 0.0001). Absolute fusion rate differences (joints with adequate fill minus those without adequate fill) were consistent across joints (61% to 63%) and for graft materials. The overall odds ratio (OR) of successful fusion in joints with adequate graft fill compared with those without adequate graft fill was 16.4 (95% confidence interval, 9.6 to 27.9). Conclusions: This study demonstrates an association between the amount of graft material and successful hindfoot and ankle arthrodesis. Graft material filling of >= 50% of the fusion space at 9 weeks, regardless of type or origin, was associated with significantly higher fusion rates at 24 weeks.

A Novel Device for Resonance Frequency Assessment of One-Piece Implants	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL IMPLANTS			English	Article						damping ratio; implant stability quotient; one-piece implants; primary stability; resonance frequency analysis	PRIMARY STABILITY; DAMPING CAPACITY; IN-VITRO; MODEL	Purpose: Immediate loading and/or restoration of dental implants requires the assessment of implant stability, which is best performed by resonance frequency analysis (RFA) prior to loading. One-piece dental implants are usually used for immediate loading, but there is currently no available reliable method to assess the primary stability of one-piece dental implants. Therefore, this study sought to validate a novel device designed for RFA measurements of one-piece implants. Material and Methods: Thirty (3.75 X 13 mm) internal-hex implants (Seven, MIS) were divided into two groups; 15 were placed in an acrylic glass block and 15 were placed in fresh porcine jawbone using 30 N/cm(2) of insertion torque. Implant stability quotient (ISQ) values were measured using the Osstell Mentor device; then, a new external fixation device was attached to the implant abutment with a 10-mm arm extending from the implant to an internal-hex ring at its proximal end. ISQ values were measured at the implant's internal hex and at the internal hex of the device, and the damping ratio was calculated. The measurements were repeated with 15 (3 X 13 mm) one-piece implants (UNO, MIS) attached to the same device. Results: The damping ratio between the implant and the proximal device was 23.6% +/- 4% in acrylic glass (50.1 +/- 1.7 ISO and 38.2 +/- 1.8 ISQ, respectively) and 23.1% +/- 3% in porcine bone (74.9 +/- 2.8 ISQ and 57.5 +/- 0.5 ISQ, respectively). ISQ values determined by the device on one-piece and two-piece implants were similar (57.4 +/- 0.9 and 57.5 +/- 0.5, respectively). Conclusion: With the present validation of this external fixation device for the measurements of implant stability using RFA, it is now possible to measure primary stability of any one-piece implant system, obviating the need for custom-made Osstell adaptors.

Materials and Methods A prospective arthroplasty registry was queried for patients with CPT codes for primary TKA, tibial plateau ORIF, removal of hardware (ROH), and diagnosis of post-traumatic arthritis. Patients were included if they had undergone tibial plateau ORIF and subsequent TKA. Chart review was performed to obtain demographic, clinical and post-operative information. Results Twenty-one patients were identified, with average age of 56.23 +/- 13.2 years at time of tibial plateau ORIF and 62.91 +/- 10.8 years at time of TKA. Seven (33.3%) patients had a tibial plateau fracture-related infection (FRI). Eight (38.1%) patients underwent ROH prior to TKA. Seven (33.3%) patients' TKA incision incorporated the prior plateau incisions. Eight (36.4%) patients developed wound complications following TKA and 5 (23.8%) developed an acute periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) following TKA and had the plateau incision incorporated into the TKA incision. FRI history did not increase the rate of wound complications but did increase the rate of ROH prior to TKA. Conclusions Previous FRI involving tibial plateau repair surgery doesn't correlate with PJI after conversion TKA for post traumatic OA. Surgeon-controlled factors such as staged ROH and incision placement can help reduce the rate of wound complications following TKA performed after tibial plateau ORIF.

The aim of our study is to analyze predictors related to poor outcome in surgically treated acetabular fractures. Damage to the femoral head cartilage and poor fracture reduction has been reported as predictors to total hip arthroplasty (THA). Material and methods: retrospective study of 207 consecutive patients with acetabular fractures, over a fourteen-year period. Demographic data, fracture pattern according to AO/OTA, complications related to surgery and predictor variables were analyzed. Results: Analyzing predictor variables, we observed seagull sign, femoral head dislocation, femoral osteochondral damage, acetabular marginal impaction, poor acetabular roof congruency after surgery (p < 0.001) and postoperative fracture congruence ( > 3mm) (p < 0.023) statistically related to the need of a THA during follow-up. Age (p = 0,98), Sex(p = 0,27), AO-OTA classification (p = 0,10), type of dislocation (p = 0,25), surgical approach (p = 0,57), time to surgery (p = 0,66) and posterior wall involvement (p = 0,06) were not related to THA. Most frequent complication was nerve injury, affecting 22 patients (20.18%). Only seventeen patients (15.6%) needed a THA at an average time of 6 years after initial open reduction and internal fixation. Conclusion: Femoral head damage and dislocation, fracture reduction, and seagull sign were the strongest predictors related to THA after surgical treatment of acetabular fractures.

Materials and Methods: An Institutional Review Board-approved prospective study of 56 consecutive patients of mid-lumbar burst fractures with a load-sharing score of 7 or more treated with anterior plating was carried out. All patients were evaluated for radiologic and clinical outcomes. The fusion status, spinal canal compromise, segmental kyphotic angle (SKA), vertebral body height loss (VBHL), and adjacent segment degeneration was examined for radiologic outcome, whereas the American Spinal Injury Association scale, the visual analog scale (VAS), and the employment status were used for clinical evaluation. Results: The patients underwent clinical and radiologic followup for at least 5 years after the surgery. At the last followup, there was no case of internal fixation failure, adjacent segment degeneration, and other complications. Interbody fusion was achieved in all cases. The average fusion time was 4.5 months. No patient suffered neurological deterioration and the average neurologic recovery was 1.3 grades on final observation. Based on VAS pain scores, canal compromise, percentage of VBHL and SKA, the difference was statistically significant between the preoperative period and postoperative or final followup (P < 0.05). Results at postoperative and final followup were better than the preoperative period. However, the difference was not significant between postoperative and final followup (P > 0.05). Thirty-four patients who were employed before the injury returned to work after the operation, 15 had changed to less strenuous work. Conclusion: Good mid term clinicoradiological results of anterior decompression with D-rod and titanium mesh fixation for suitable patients with mid-lumbar burst fractures with incomplete neurologic deficits can be achieved. The incident rate of complications was low. D-rod is a reliable implant and has some potential advantages in L4 vertebral fractures.

Pre-armed kyphoplasty and post-armed kyphoplasty mean posterior wall retropulsion was 5.8 and 4.5 mm, respectively, and mean vertebral body height was 10.8 and 16.7 mm, respectively. They conclude that in the treatment of burst fractures with posterior wall retropulsion and no neurologic deficit, armed kyphoplastyyields fracture reduction, internal fixation, and indirect central canal decompression. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Burst fractures are characterized by middle column disruption and may feature posterior wall retropulsion. Indications for treatment remain controversial. Recently introduced vertebral augmentation techniques using intravertebral distraction devices, such as vertebral body stents and SpineJack, could be effective in fracture reduction and fixation and might obtain central canal clearance through ligamentotaxis. This study assesses the results of armed kyphoplasty using vertebral body stents or SpineJack in traumatic, osteoporotic, and neoplastic burst fractures with respect to vertebral body height restoration and correction of posterior wall retropulsion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective assessment of 53 burst fractures with posterior wall retropulsion and no neurologic deficit in 51 consecutive patients treated with armed kyphoplasty. Posterior wall retropulsion and vertebral body height were measured on pre- and postprocedural CT. Clinical and radiologic follow-up charts were reviewed. RESULTS: Armed kyphoplasty was performed as a stand-alone treatment in 43 patients, combined with posterior instrumentation in 8 and laminectomy in 4. Pre-armed kyphoplasty and post-armed kyphoplasty mean posterior wall retropulsion was 5.8 and 4.5 mm, respectively (P < .001), and mean vertebral body height was 10.8 and 16.7 mm, respectively (P < .001). No significant clinical complications occurred. Clinical and radiologic follow-up (1?36 months; mean, 8 months) was available in 39 patients. Three treated levels showed a new fracture during follow-up without neurologic deterioration, and no retreatment was deemed necessary. CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of burst fractures with posterior wall retropulsion and no neurologic deficit, armed kyphoplasty yields fracture reduction, internal fixation, and indirect central canal decompression. In selected cases, it might represent a suitable minimally invasive treatment option, stand-alone or in combination with posterior stabilization.	[Venier, A.; Scarone, P.; Kuhlen, D.

The study further aimed to determine the necessary follow-up time for future studies aiming to evaluate the treatment of such fractures. Materials and methods: This is a single-center retrospective cohort study with prospectively collected data including skeletally mature patients with undisplaced FNFs operated between 2005 and 2013. Gender, age at fracture, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, smoking status and excess use of alcohol were retrieved from electronical medical records. Further, complications leading to all consecutive reoperations were registered along with time from primary operation to all reoperations, type of procedure during subsequent surgeries and time of death. Results: 383 patients with a median (range) follow-up of 77 (23-125) months were identified. Within 1, 2 and 5 years from primary surgery, 8%, 17% and 21% respectively, had at least one subsequent surgery in the same hip. 10% of the patients underwent salvage arthroplasty, however, in long time survivors; conversion to arthroplasty was estimated in one out of four. Posterior tilt of the femoral head was a predictor for new surgeries due to instability of the bone-implant construct, but not for later avascular necrosis. For patients 70 years or older, the one-year mortality in men was 32% with an expected survival of approx. 2.5 years, compared to 17% and 5.5 years in women. Conclusions: Screw fixation of undisplaced femoral neck fractures appears to be a safe procedure in particular in the absence of a posterior tilt of the femoral head. Conversion to arthroplasty was estimated to occur in one out of four of long time survivors. Men have a particularly poor medical prognosis and should receive careful medical attention. In order to capture 80% of reoperations, clinical studies and register studies must have a follow-up time of at least two years. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Low-dose CT (LDCT) could possibly have a sufficient diagnostic accuracy but with a lower radiation dose. Purpose To compare postoperative diagnostic accuracy of LDCT and CR after open reduction and internal fixation of pelvic fracture. Material and Methods Twenty-one patients were examined with LDCT and CR 0-9 days after surgery. The examinations were reviewed by two musculoskeletal radiologists. Hardware, degree of fracture reduction, image quality, and reviewing time were assessed, and effective radiation dose was calculated. Inter-reader agreement was calculated. Results LDCT was significantly better than CR in determining whether hardware positioning was assessable (P < 0.001). Acetabular congruence was assessable in all fractured patients with LDCT. In 12 of the 32 assessments with CR of patients with an acetabular fracture, joint congruence was not assessable due to overlapping hardware (P = 0.001). Image quality was significantly higher for LDCT. Median time to review was 240 s for LDCT compared to 180 s for CR. Effective dose was 0.79 mSv for LDCT compared to 0.32 mSv for CR (P < 0.001). Conclusion LDCT is more reliable than CR in assessing hardware position and fracture reduction. Joint congruency is sometimes not possible to assess with CR, due to overlapping hardware. The image quality is higher, but also the effective dose, with LDCT than with CR.

Nineteen patients who underwent the revision operations because of failure in the first operation were included in this study. All the malformations were identified as fully segmented hemivertebra, including 16 cases in thoracolumbar vertebra (T10: three patients; T12: seven patients; L1: six patients), and three cases in thoracic vertebra (T8). The causes of failure in the first operation and the outcome of revision procedure for patients were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were successfully performed the personalized revision surgeries. The failure reasons of the first operation included limitations of the first operation procedure, no or incomplete resection of the malformed hemivertebra, improper operation during surgery, improper internal fixation material, and improper internal fixation scope. The average postoperative scoliosis Cobb's angle and kyphosis Cobb's angle were corrected from 54.1 degrees preoperatively to 23.1 degrees postoperatively, and 59.3 degrees preoperatively to 25.8 degrees postoperatively, respectively. The average postoperative distance between the C7 plumb line and the center sacral vertical line was decreased from 2.5cm preoperatively to 1.5cm postoperatively. The average follow-up period was 2.2 years. No serious complication was observed. The cause of the failure of the first operations for the congenital scoliosis due to hemivertebra is verified. Our study may provide a basis for the treatment of congenital scoliosis due to hemivertebra.

Internal fixation using a plate for DUFs might be challenging because of the presence of osteoporotic bone and fragile bone fragments in elderly patients. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that a strategy including VLP fixation for DRFs and non-intervention for DUFs with early wrist mobilization would provide encouraging results in elderly patients. Materials and methods: Eighteen patients (17 women and one man, mean age 74.7 years) were included in the study. According to the Biyani classification, there were seven patients with type-1, three with type-2, five with type-3, and three with type-4 DUFs. Radiological results were analyzed in 18 patients and the clinical results could be evaluated in 10 patients who attended the necessary follow-up meetings. Ulnar angular deformity (UAD) and ulnar shortening amount (USA) were measured using anteroposterior radiographs. USA was defined as the difference in ulnar variance between just after surgery and at the final visit. Clinical results were assessed using the modified Gartland and Werley score, disability arm shoulder hand (DASH) score, range of motion, grip strength, pain, and distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability. Results: All ulna metaphyseal fractures united. The mean UAD just after surgery was 5.9 degrees (range, 0-22). At the final visit, the mean UAD was 6.4 degrees (range, 0-17). The mean USA was 0.35 mm, and only one patient showed ulnar shortening of >2 mm. The results were "excellent" in nine patients and "good" in one, according to the modified Gartland and Werley score. The mean DASH score was 4.2. Mean flexion and extension angles were 58 degrees and 71 degrees. One patient complained of ulnar-sided pain during exertion and no patients complained of DRUJ instability. Discussion: All DUFs achieved good radiological results, including comminuted fractures. Functional outcomes were promising, including wide wrist ROM and no DRUJ instability. An approach including VLP fixation for DRFs and non-intervention for DUFs is a good option for elderly patients. Level of evidence: IV retrospective study. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Herein we report the development of a calcium-based catalyst system for the synthesis of challenging internal and trisubstituted cyclic carbonates from bio-derived epoxides and CO2 under mild reaction conditions. Several crown ethers were tested as ligands in combination with various cocatalysts for the possible activation of CO2. The most active system consists of a dicyclohexyl-functionalized 18-crown-6 ether and triphenylphosphane in addition to calcium iodide. The in situ complexation of Ca2+ by the crown ether was detected by H-1 NMR spectroscopy. Interestingly, the addition of triphenylphosphane as a cocatalyst leads to a significant increase in activity, which is similar to or even higher than that of organic superbases such as DBU and TBD. The catalytic system was employed in the conversion of 16 different bio-derived epoxides, including fatty acid esters, oils, and terpenes with CO,, and is able to facilitate the reaction under mild conditions. Various internal epoxides were converted at only 45 degrees C, 0.5 MPa CO2 pressure, a catalyst loading of 5 mol %, and a reaction time of 24 h with isolated yields up to 98% of the respective carbonate. The challenging terpene-based carbonates were isolated in yields up to 81%, although harsher reaction conditions were necessary.

Materials and Methods: Forty-seven competitive or recreational athletes with ankle fractures underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). Thirty-six met the inclusion criteria, of which 27 returned for clinical and radiographic exams and also completed validated surveys and a subjective questionnaire. Results: Nineteen of the 27 were male. The average age of all patients was 18.1 +/- 5.9 years. The final evaluations occurred 12 months to 3.7 years after surgery. Injuries occurred in 13 different sports, of which football had the most (n = 10). Bimalleolar fractures were the most prevalent (n = 10) followed by isolated lateral malleolar fractures (a = 6), syndesmosis injury (n = 4), Salter-Harris (n = 4), medial malleolar fracture (n = 2) and pilon fracture (n = 1). The patients with isolated lateral malleolar fractures returned to competition soonest (6.8 +/- 2.4 weeks) while patients with isolated medial malleolus fractures took the longest to return at a mean of 17.0 +/- 9.9 weeks. Scores for function and pain on the Lower Limb Core Module and for pain on the Foot and Ankle module were all greater than 90. Conclusion: Athletes who undergo ORIF followed by early motion and early weight-bearing are able to return to their pre-injury level of competition within 2 to 4 months with minimal functional morbidity or pain.

However, no study has investigated the hidden ONFH after FNF, which is missed by simple radiographs, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Materials and methods This retrospective study involved 58 consecutive patients who underwent implant removal surgery after internal fixation due to FNF. MRI was used to investigate the incidence of hidden ONFHs, which were not initially revealed on plain radiographs. The comparisons between hidden ONFH and other groups were performed for patent demographics and clinical variables including ONFH location, lesion size, the progression rate of ONFH collapse, and end-stage arthroplasty conversion rate. Results Of the 58 patients, 38 exhibited no evidence of ONFH on plain radiograph screening. However, 13 of the 38 patients were confirmed of hidden ONFH via MRI. The collapse progressed in four of the 13 patients, and one of them underwent total hip arthroplasty surgery. No significant differences were found between the hidden and definite ONFH groups in demographics and clinical variables. However, a significant difference exists between the hidden ONFH and the normally healed FNF groups in terms of the Garden type (P < 0.001). Conclusions A large number of cases with hidden ONFH were confirmed using MRI following healed FNF, and most of them were initially displaced FNF. Thus, the treatment method between internal fixation and hip arthroplasty should be carefully selected, particularly with displaced FNF.

Although these fractures comprise only 1% of all fractures, the fracture pattern is usually complex and requires anatomical reduction and absolutely stable fixation to achieve satisfactory results. The development of knee osteoarthritis is a common late complication and it can be strongly influenced by additional, underestimated cartilage defects, and meniscal and ligament tears. Materials and methods: Between January 2012 and February 2015, a total of 78 patients with tibial plateau fractures (Schatzker type I-III) were enrolled in the study. Patients were divided into two groups: one group was treated with arthroscopically-assisted reduction and internal fixation (ARIF) and the other with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). The final number of patients was 75; 40 in the ARIF group and 35 in the ORIF group. Radiography and computed tomography were used to assess fracture pattern. An immediate postoperative radiographwas performed, and then repeated at 6 weeks, and 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. Demographic data (age and sex), additional intraarticular injuries, hospital stay and complications were noted, and clinical and radiological Rasmunssen score at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery were evaluated. Results: Additional intraarticular lesions were found in 27 patients; 20 in the ARIF group and 7 in the ORIF group (p = 0.06). There was a statistically significant difference in average duration of hospital stay: 3.10 +/- 0.63 days for the ARIF group and 5.51 +/- 1.66 days for the ORIF group (p = 0.0001). All fractures healed within 3 months following surgery. The overall complication rate was 12%. There was no statistically significant difference in complication rate between the two groups (p = 0.63). Clinical and radiological scores were excellent in most patients in both groups. There was no statistically significant difference in average clinical and radiological Rasmunssen scores between the two groups. Conclusions: Both ARIF and ORIF can provide equally good results; however, ARIF seems to offer a more precise evaluation and treatment of associated intraarticular lesions and to reduce the duration of hospital stay.

Definitive External Fixation for Anterior Stabilization of Combat-related Pelvic Ring Injuries, With or Without Sacroiliac Fixation	CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the Society-of-Military-Orthopaedic-Surgeons (SOMOS)	DEC 10-14, 2018	Keystone, CO	Soc Mil Orthopaed Surg			DAMAGE CONTROL; POLYTRAUMA PATIENTS; PLACEMENT; TRAUMA; WOUNDS; IRAQ; AFGHANISTAN; MANAGEMENT; REDUCTION; FRACTURES	Background Combat-related pelvic ring injuries frequently lead to placement of a temporizing external fixation device for early resuscitation and transport. These injuries are commonly complicated by concomitant polytrauma and extensive soft-tissue injuries, which may preclude early internal fixation and lead to prolonged use of external fixation. To date, few studies have reported on the outcomes of definitive external fixation for combat-related pelvic ring injuries. Questions/purposes (1) In patients treated with definitive external fixation after combat-related pelvic ring injuries, how often is the quality of reduction within radiographically acceptable parameters at the end of treatment? (2) What proportion of patients demonstrate local heterotopic ossification after these injuries? (3) What patient- and treatment-related factors are associated with increased complications and pain? Methods We retrospectively studied all patients with pelvic ring injuries treated at a tertiary military referral center from January 2003 to December 2012. In total, 114 patients were identified, 55 of whom maintained an external fixation frame throughout their treatment. During that time, the general indications for definitive external fixation were an open, contaminated pelvic ring injury with a high risk of infection or open urologic injury; confluent abdominal, perineal, and thigh wounds; or comminution of the pubic ramus that would necessitate plate fixation extending up the anterior column in patients with open abdomen or exposure-compromising abdominal wounds. Posterior fixation, either sacroiliac or lumbopelvic, was applied in patients with sacroiliac instability. Of the 55 patients with pelvic ring injuries treated with definitive external fixation (27 open and 28 closed), four underwent hemipelvectomy and construct removal for massive ascending infections and four were lost to follow-up, leaving 47 patients (85%) who were available at a minimum follow-up of 12 months (median 29 months, interquartile range 17-43 months). All 47 patients underwent serial imaging to assess their injury and reduction during treatment. External fixators were typically removed after 12 weeks, except in patients in whom pin-site irritation or infection prompted earlier removal, and all were confirmed to be grossly stable during an examination under anesthesia. Clinical union was defined as the absence of radiographically present fracture lines and stable examination findings under anesthesia when the external fixator was removed. Data on demographics, injury pattern, associated injuries, revision procedures, complications, and final functional outcomes including ambulation status, sexual function, and pain were collected. Pelvic radiographs were reviewed for the initial injury pattern, type of pelvic fixation construct, residual displacement after removal of the frame, and evidence of formation of heterotopic ossification in the pelvis or bilateral hips. Pelvic displacement and diastasis were determined by digital caliper measurement on plain images; malunion was defined as anterior diastasis of the pelvis or vertical incongruity of the hemipelvis greater than 10 mm. Results Radiographic malunion after construct removal occurred in eight of 24 patients with open injuries and in five of 23 patients with closed injuries. Heterotopic ossification developed in the pelvis or hips of all 24 patients with open injuries and in two of the 23 patients with closed injuries. In patients with open pelvic ring injuries, concomitant acetabular fractures were associated with pelvic pain at the final follow-up examination (risk ratio 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-3.5; p = 0.017). No treatment factor resulted in superior functional outcomes. In the closed-injury group, concomitant lower-extremity amputation was associated with improved radiographic final reduction (RR 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.7; p = 0.02). There was no association between radiographic malunion and increased pain (RR 1.9; 95% CI, 0.5-7.0; p = 0.54 for the open group; RR 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-1.0; p = 0.86 for the closed group). Conclusion In this series of patients with severe combat-related pelvic ring injuries who were treated anteriorly with definitive external fixation because of a severe soft-tissue injury, high infection risk, or unacceptable physiologic cost of internal fixation, malunion and chronic pelvic pain were less common than previously observed. Prior studies primarily differ in their lack of sacroiliac or lumbopelvic stabilization for posteriorly unstable fracture patterns, likely accounting for much of these differences. There may have been important between-study differences such as extremely severe injuries, concomitant injuries, and study population. Our study also differs because we specifically analyzed a large cohort of patients who sustained open pelvic ring injuries. Future studies should prospectively investigate the ideal construct type and pin material, optimize the length of treatment and assessment of healing, and improve radiographic measures to predict long-term functional outcomes.

Aim To analyze and evaluate the functional and the radiological outcome of patients with acetabular fracture treated with open reduction and internal fixation. Materials and methods It is a retrospective study on 24 patients treated with ORIF and followed up in the Trauma Orthopedic Surgery Department of the Military Hospital of Moulay Ismail of Meknes (MHMIM) between January 2014 and December 2019. The average follow-up duration was 35 months (range: 9-81 months). The functional and radiographic outcomes and complication were considered as the main facts in this study. Results Twenty-four patients (male: 18, female: 6) with average age 38 years (range: 16 to 65 years) were operated for acetabular fracture. With Matta criteria use for assessing the radiological outcomes, the anatomical and good reduction was achieved in 79.1% of the patients. The functional results based on the modified Merle d'Aubigne and Postel criteria were judged excellent in 70.83%. Postoperative complications of acetabular fracture such as heterotopic ossification were found in 16%, post-traumatic arthritis in 20%, and avascular necrosis in 12.5% of patients. Conclusion As there is a strong correlation between anatomic reduction and clinical outcome, the ORIF constitutes an effective method for treatment of displaced acetabular fracture in young aged patients who are considered as the most vulnerable categories in our continent.

A consensus regarding the biomechanical effects of vertical bone loss in normal and osteoporotic bone tissue according to different implant-abutment interfaces is lacking. Purpose. The purpose of this finite element analysis study was to evaluate the effect of vertical bone loss (without bone loss; with 1.5-mm bone loss; with 3-mm bone loss; and with 4.5-mm bone loss) in normal and osteoporotic bone that received a o4x10-mm implant with different implant-abutment connections (external connection [external hexagon] and internal connection [Morse taper]) by using 3D finite element analysis. Material and methods. Sixteen 3D models were simulated. Axial and oblique forces of 200 N and 100 N, respectively, were applied on the occlusal surfaces of the prostheses. Maximum principal stress and microstrain were determined from the bone tissue of each model. von Mises stress analysis was used to evaluate the stress distribution in implants and prosthetic components (fixation screws, abutment, and crown). Results. The results showed higher stress concentrations in models with bone loss as increased vertical bone loss contributed to higher stress and microstrain in the bone tissue, regardless of the quality of bone and implant-abutment connection. Osteoporotic bone contributed to increase in microstrain in the trabecular bone. The internal connection showed lower stress than the external connection implants only in models without marginal bone loss. Furthermore, higher stress concentrations were observed in the implants and fixation screws in models with increased bone loss and external connection implants, mainly under oblique loading. Osteoporotic bone did not affect stress distribution in the implants and prosthetic components. Conclusions. Progressive bone loss contributed to higher stress in the bone tissue, implants, and prosthetic components. The osteoporotic bone affects only the microstrain in the trabecular bone, but not the stress in the implants and prosthetic components. The internal connection implants showed lower stress in the cortical bone only in models without bone loss, while external connection implants exhibited higher stress in the implants and screws under oblique loading.

In the present study, we propose a treatment protocol using an internal joint stabilizer through a single posterior approach and analyze the clinical results.Materials and MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed 15 elderly patients with terrible triad injuries of the elbow who underwent our treatment protocol from January 2015 to December 2020. The surgery involved a posterior approach, identification of the ulnar nerve, bone and ligament reconstruction, and the application of the internal joint stabilizer. A rehabilitation program was initiated immediately after the operation. Surgery-related complications, elbow range of motion (ROM), and functional outcomes were evaluated.ResultsThe mean follow-up period was 21.7 months (range, 16-36 months). ROM at the final follow-up was 130 degrees in extension to flexion and 164 degrees in pronation to supination. The mean Mayo Elbow Performance Score was 94 at the final follow-up. Major complications included breaking of the internal joint stabilizer in 2 patients, transient numbness over the ulnar nerve territory in one, and local infection due to irritation of the internal joint stabilizer in one.ConclusionsAlthough the current study involved only a small number of patients and the protocol comprised two stages of operation, we believe that such a technique may be a valuable alternative for the treatment of these difficult cases.Level of Clinical Evidence4.

Materials and methods: The study population comprised 74 adolescents with Delbet II FNF, with an average age of 13.31 y (range, 10-17 y). There were 19 and 55 patients, respectively, with and without (control) free fracture fragments. The patients underwent open (n = 41) or closed (n = 33) fracture reduction and then cannulated screw internal fixation. Postoperative functional evaluation was performed using Ratliffs criteria, and complications such as femoral head necrosis, premature epiphyseal closure, and coxa vara were recorded. Results: All patients achieved bony union during the mean follow-up period of 15.6 mo (range, 12-78 mo). By Ratliffs criteria, the clinical outcomes of the patients with free fracture fragment (three excellent, eight good, eight poor) were significantly worse compared with the control group (26 excellent, 20 good, and nine poor). The rate of complications (femoral head necrosis, premature epiphyseal closure, and coxa vara) of patients with free fracture fragments was significantly higher than that of the control patients. Conclusions: In adolescents with Delbet II FNF, the presence of free fracture fragments is associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Delbet II FNF in adolescents with free fracture fragment may be a special clinical entity with a poorer outcome. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, these methods have their own disadvantages. Objective: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of one-stage posterior debridement with iliac bone graft, titanium mesh bone graft, or nanohydroxyapatite/polyamide-66 cage in thoracic and lumbar tuberculosis. Materials and Methods: Between January 2013 and December 2018, 57 patients with thoracic or lumbar tuberculosis were treated by interbody bone graft combined with posterior internal fixation after debridement. Thirteen patients were treated with iliac bone graft to construct the stability of the vertebral body, 26 patients were treated with titanium mesh bone graft, and 18 patients were treated with nanohydroxyapatite/polyamide-66 cage bone graft. The main clinical results were evaluated by intervertebral height, cage subsidence, operation time, operative blood loss, postoperative hospitalization, postoperative complications, visual analog scale (VAS) score, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade, and bone graft fusion time. All the outcomes were recorded and analyzed by statistical methods. Results: The mean follow-up time was 24.5 months. Neurologic function was improved in most patients at the last follow-up. There were significant differences in ESR, CRP, and VAS score between preoperative and postoperative values; however, there were no significant differences in ESR, CRP, and VAS score among the three groups. There were no significant differences in operation time, blood loss, postoperative hospitalization, and postoperative complications among the three groups at discharge. There was no significant difference in ASIA grade among the three groups at the last follow-up. Nanohydroxyapatite/polyamide-66 cage group had a lower cage subsidence (P = 0.013). The bone graft fusion time of the nanohydroxyapatite/polyamide-66 cage group was significantly shorter than the iliac bone graft group and the titanium mesh bone graft (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The follow-up outcomes showed that the method involving one-stage posterior debridement and internal fixation, interbody graft, and fusion is an effective and safe surgical method for patients with thoracic and lumbar tuberculosis. The incidence rate of cage subsidence was less and the bone graft fusion time was shorter with nanohydroxyap atite/polyamide 66 cage when compared with iliac bone graft and titanium mesh bone graft in the surgical treatment of thoracic and lumbar tuberculosis.

Design of Bifunctional Zinc(II)-Organic Framework for Efficient Coupling of CO<sub>2</sub> with Terminal/Internal Epoxides under Mild Conditions	CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN			English	Article							METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS; CYCLIC CARBONATES; CHEMICAL FIXATION; CATALYTIC CONVERSION; SELECTIVE CAPTURE; RATIONAL DESIGN; DIOXIDE; ADSORPTION; POLYMERS; MOF	The rational design of efficient catalytic materials for conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas into valuable products has fascinated chemists ever since the advent of the area of green and sustainable catalysis. Herein, we report design of a bifunctional, 3D Zn-MOF, [Zn-3(BINDI)(DATRZ)(2)(H2O)(2)](n) by utilizing a Lewis acidic Zn(II) ion, long-chain, rigid aromatic tetracarboxylate ligand, N,N'-bis(5-isophthalic acid)naphthalenediimide (BINDIH4) and basic -NH2 rich 3,5-diamino-1,2,4-triazole (DATRZ) linker. The Zn-MOF possesses a BET surface area of 1085.8 m(2)/g and a high density of CO2-philic -NH2 groups lined in the 1D channels promoting selective and recyclable CO2 adsorption with a high heat of interaction energy of 44.3 kJ/mol. The high surface area combined with the presence of Lewis acidic (LA) and basic sites rendered Zn-MOF an ideal bifunctional heterogeneous catalyst for efficient coupling of CO2 with terminal/internal epoxides under eco-friendly, solvent-free, RT and atmospheric pressure (balloon) conditions. Interestingly, Zn-MOF showed excellent catalytic activity for fixation of CO2 even from simulated flue gas/dilute CO2 gas. Remarkably, Zn-MOF showed high recyclability for up to 10 cycles with retaining the framework stability and catalytic activity. Overall, this work demonstrates the rational integration of Lewis acidic and basic sites in a 3D framework for the efficient utilization of CO2 under environment-friendly conditions.

Interlocked Pins Increase Strength by a Lateral Spread of Load in Femoral Neck Fixation: a Cadaver Study	ACTA CHIRURGIAE ORTHOPAEDICAE ET TRAUMATOLOGIAE CECHOSLOVACA			English	Article						femoral neck fracture; biomechanics; cadaver bone; bone mineral; internal fixation; locking plate; interlocked pins	INTRACAPSULAR HIP-FRACTURES; LOCKING PLATE; INTERNAL-FIXATION; TARGON(R) FN; SCREW; SYSTEM; EXPERIENCE; FAILURE	PURPOSE OF THE STUDY To improve the important torsional, bending and compressive stability in femoral neck fixation, locking plates have been the latest contribution. However, increased strength by restricted fracture motion may come at expense of an altered load distribution and failure patterns. Within locking plate technology, the important intermediate fracture compression may principally be achieved by multiple sliding screws passing through a sideplate fixed to the femur or connected to an interlocking plate not fixed to the femur laterally, sliding "en bloc" with the plate. While biomechanical studies may deliver the short-time patient safety requirements in implant development, no adequate failure evaluation has been performed with interlocking devices ex vivo in this setting. In the present biomechanical study, we analysed if a novel femoral neck interlocking plate with pins could improve fixation performance by changing the parameters involved in the failure mechanism in terms of fixation strength, fracture motion, load distribution and failure pattern. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixteen pairs of human femurs with stable subcapital osteotomies were fixated by 2 pins or 3 pins interlocked in a plate using a paired design. Femurs were loaded non-destructively to 10 torsion around the neck axis, 200 N anteroposterior bending and 500 N vertical compression in 7 adduction with 1 Hz in 20 000 cycles, and were subsequently subjected to destructive compression to evaluate failure patterns. Bending stiffness, compressive stiffness and displacement from compressive testing reflected fracture motion. Torque and compression to failure replicated known failure mechanisms and defined strength. To evaluate load distribution, associations between biomechanical parameters and measured local bone mineral measurements by quantitative CT were analysed. RESULTS Interlocked pins increased mean strength 73% in torsion and 39% in compression (p = 0.038). Strength was related to all 4 regional mineral masses from the femoral head to subtrochanterically with interlocking (r = 0.64-0.83, p = 0.034), while only to mineral masses in the femoral head in compression and to the head, neck and trochanterically in torsion with individual pins (r = 0.67-0.78, p = 0.024). No difference was detected in fracture motion or failure pattern. DISCUSSION Within the last decade, angular stable implants have expanded our therapeutic arsenal of femoral neck fractures. Increased stability at the expense of altered devastating failure patterns was not retrieved in our study. The broadened understanding of the effect of interlocking pins by an isolated plate as in the current study involved the feature to gain fixation strength. By permitting fracture compression, and through a significant change of correlations between mechanical parameters and local bone mineral factors, a lateral redistribution of load with interlocked pins from the fragile bone medially to the more solid lateral bone was demonstrated. Regarding the long-term patient safety of interlocked pins and healing complications of non-union and segmental collapse of the femoral head, a definite conclusion may be premature. However, the improved biomechanics of an interlocking plate must be considered a favourable development of the pin concept. CONCLUSIONS Interlocked pins may improve fixation performance by a better load distribution, not by restricting fracture motion with corresponding altered failure patterns. This is encouraging and a challenge to complete further studies of the interlocking plate technology in the struggle to find the optimal treatment of the femoral neck fracture.	[Brattgjerd, J.

Therefore, this study is to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of a new "U"-shaped staple in the treatment of postoperative ankle valgus of congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT). Method According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 33 patients with postoperative ankle valgus of CPT were treated with new "U"-shaped staples from May 2013 to September 2019. The deformity of ankle valgus was gradually corrected by implanting a new "U"-shaped staple on the medial side of the distal tibia. Clinical indexes such as the operation time, intraoperative bleeding and hospital stay were observed. Tibiotalar angle was selected as the evaluation index of ankle valgus. American Orthopedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) scale was used for clinical evaluation of ankle function. The tibiotalar angle, deformity correction rate and complications were evaluated by preoperative, postoperative and last follow-up imaging data. Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis. Results Thirty-three patients, including 12 males and 21 females were included. All the patients were followed up for at least 14 months, with an average of 35 months. The average operation time was 23 (15-40) min, the average amount of intraoperative bleeding was 7.5 (4-10) mL, and the average hospital stay was 4.2 (3-6) days. The intraoperative tibiotalar angles of all patients were 74.2 degrees +/- 4.6 degrees, the tibiotalar angle were 86.8 degrees +/- 4.9 degrees when internal fixation was removed, and the tibiotalar angles at the last follow-up were 84.3 degrees +/- 5.9 degrees. The average orthopedic rate was 0.68 degrees per month. No patients suffered from serious complications such as screw prolapse, osteomyelitis, wound infection, etc. Postoperative wound pain complications occurred in two patients, which were relieved after conservative treatment. The AOFAS score improved from 46.2 +/- 9.4 before the operation to 74.6 +/- 5.7 at the last follow-up (P < 0.01). The ankle movement was good without joint stiffness. There was no epiphyseal plate injury after the removal of internal fixation. Conclusion The new "U"-shaped staple is characterized by simple implantation, low notch, lower risk of fixation failure and close fitting with cortical bone. It is a safe and effective internal fixation system for the treatment of ankle valgus in children.

The analysis was made for oriented PLLA, 96L/4D PLA and 80L/20D,L PLA. The analyzed polymers were found to have identical rate of iv loss (P < 0.05), given that the materials have otherwise similar initial material properties. The effect of the post-processing residual monomer was dose dependent, i.e. the higher the monomer content the faster the degradation (P < 0.05). Samples with a smaller diameter (1.1 mm) were found to have a faster rate of iv loss than the samples with a larger diameter (4 mm) (P < 0.05). A multiple linear regression analysis was used to create a five-component linear model to predict changes in the materials' inherent viscosity. This model yielded accurate predictions during the initial stages of the hydrolytic degradation process where the iv loss was virtually linear.

This method describes the use of g-C3N4/BiOBr nanocomposite for the superior photocatalytic performances under visible light excitation (lambda > 420 nm). The crystalline phase, morphology, textile structure and components of the samples were studied by several tools such as X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, N-2 adsorption-desorption, energy dispersive X-ray spectrum, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The optical, photoelectrochemical properties and band structure were measured by ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, steady-state photoluminescence spectra, photocurrent response analysis, electrochemical impedance spectra and valence-band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques, respectively. In addition, the catalytic activities of the hetero-structural material were broadly investigated and compared with single BiOBr or g-C3N4 alone in the same reaction. The as-obtained BiOBr/g-C3N4 composite showed distinctive advantages over BiOBr alone and universality for various substrate, i.e., dichloronaphthol degradation and reduction efficiency of Cr (VI) over BiOBr/g-C3N4 was increased by up to 3 and 2.5 times, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared BiOBr/g-C3N4 complex was mainly contributed to the effective charge transfer, which can further cause the establishment of the internal electric field in the interface between BiOBr and g-C3N4 to boost the space charge separation. This work gives a new route for designing high efficient semiconductor hybrid photocatalyst with broad absorption region as well as quick charge separation.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence and severity of femoral malrotation after nailing of trochanteric fractures. Materials and methods The authors conducted a prospective study focused on a CT analysis of malrotation after intramedullary nailing of trochanteric fractures (AO 31A1-3) in 101 patients. We recorded the type of fracture, method of anesthesia, scheduled surgery vs. acute surgery, and the surgeon's experience as possible risk factors for limb malrotation after trochanteric fracture surgeries. Results The average extent of malrotation was 9 degrees of internal rotation ranging from 29 degrees of external to 48 degrees of internal rotation. In 35% of patients, we observed a rotation greater than 15 degrees, and in 15 patients (15%), the rotation was greater than 25 degrees. The risk of significant internal malrotation was significantly higher than external malrotation (37 vs. 4 patients). None of the factors observed proved to be statistically significant. The effect of general anesthesia and the type of intertrochanteric fracture came closest to having a significant effect on rotational error. Conclusion Improper reduction of a trochanteric fracture is a common problem that can lead to femur malrotation. In our study, a rotational error greater than 15 degrees occurred in 35% of the patients, but none of the monitored factors represented a statistically significant risk for this complication.

Various methods of fixation with different implant types and using either bone grafts or bone substitutes have been reported. We performed non-locking T-buttress plate fixation with autologous iliac bone graft augmentation, which is defined here as the traditional method, and locking compression plate fixation without any bone graft or bone substitute. We aimed to compare bone union and complications of these two MOWHTO techniques. Materials and Methods: Between June 2005 and December 2007, 50 patients who underwent MOWHTO (a total of 60 knees) were retrospectively reviewed and classified into two groups: group A, which consisted of 26 patients (30 knees) was treated using T-buttress plate fixation with autologous iliac bone graft augmentation and group B, which consisted of 24 patients (30 knees) was operated upon using a medial high tibial locking compression plate without any augmentation. Demographic characteristics and radiographic outcomes, including union rate, time to union, medial osteotomy defects, and complications, were collected and compared between the two groups. The progress of all patients was followed for at least 2 years. Results: All osteotomies united within 12 weeks after surgery. Group B had slightly longer time to union than group A (10.3 weeks and 9.5 weeks, respectively; P = 0.125). A significantly higher incidence of medial defects after osteotomy was reported in the locking compression plate group (P = 0.001). A total of 5 (8.3) knees had complications. In group A, one knee had a superficial wound infection and another knee had a lateral tibial plateau fracture without significant loss of correction. In group B, one knee had screw penetration into the knee joint and two knees had local irritation that required the removal of the hardware. Conclusion: Locking compression plate fixation without the use of bone grafts or bone substitutes provides a satisfactory union rate and an acceptable complication rate when compared to the traditional MOWHTO technique. Thus, we recommend using this technique for treating unicompartmental medial knee osteoarthritis.

As a result, during their training, orthopaedic surgeons receive less formal instruction in the art of extremity immobilization and cast application and removal. Casting is not without risks and complications (eg, stiffness, pressure sores, compartment syndrome); the risk of morbidity is higher when casts are applied by less experienced practitioners. Certain materials and methods of ideal cast and splint application are recommended to prevent morbidity in the patient who is at high risk for complications with casting and splinting. Those at high risk include the obtunded or comatose multitrauma patient, the patient under anesthesia, the very young patient, the developmentally delayed patient, and the patient with spasticity.

J	Zhang, YL; Yan, C; Zhang, LC; Zhang, W; Wang, G				Zhang, Yuelei; Yan, Chao; Zhang, Lecheng; Zhang, Wei; Wang, Gang			Comparison of Ordinary Cannulated Compression Screw and Double-Head Cannulated Compression Screw Fixation in Vertical Femoral Neck Fractures	BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							INTERNAL-FIXATION; INTRACAPSULAR FRACTURES; BIOMECHANICAL ANALYSIS; LOCKING PLATE; YOUNG-ADULTS; HIP; OUTCOMES; FAILURE; FEMUR; ANGLE	Background. The treatment of vertical femoral neck fractures in young patients remains a challenge. This study is aimed at comparing ordinary cannulated compression screw (OCCS) and double-head cannulated compression screw (DhCCS) fixation in vertical femoral neck fractures both clinically and biomechanically. Materials and Methods. Clinically, the radiographs of 81 patients with Pauwel's III femoral neck fractures, including 54 fractures fixed with three parallel OCCSs and 27 fractures fixed with three parallel DhCCSs, were reviewed retrospectively. Complications consisting of fixation failure (screw loosening, obvious fracture displacement, varus deformity, or femoral neck shortening), bony nonunion, and avascular necrosis (AVN) were determined. Biomechanically, twenty synthetic femur models of vertical femoral fractures with an 80 degrees Pauwel's angle were divided into two groups and subsequently fixed with three parallel OCCSs or DhCCSs. All specimens were tested for axial stiffness, load to 5 mm displacement, and a maximum load to failure with a loading rate of 2 mm/min. Results. Clinically, 22 fractures in the OCCS group experienced fixation failure, including 19 screw loosening, 18 femoral neck shortening, 14 varus deformities, and 8 obvious fracture displacements, whereas only 4 fractures experienced fixation failure in the DhCCS group, including 3 screw loosening, 3 femoral neck shortening, 3 varus deformities, and 1 obvious fracture displacement. Additionally, 11 fractures in the OCCS group exhibited nonunion, whereas only 3 in the DhCCS group exhibited nonunion. Nine fractures with AVN were noted in the OCCS group, whereas only 1 was observed in the DhCCS group. Biomechanically, the axial stiffness of the DhCCS group was greater than that of the OCCS group (154.9 +/- 6.81 vs. 128.1 +/- 7.41 N/mm), and the load to 5 mm displacement was also significantly greater in the DhCCS group (646.1 +/- 25.87 vs. 475.8 +/- 21.46 N). Moreover, the maximum load to failure in the DhCCS group exhibited significant advantages compared with that of the OCCS group (1148 +/- 39.47 vs. 795.9 +/- 51.39 N). Conclusion. Our results suggested that using three DhCCSs improved the outcome of vertical femoral neck fractures compared to three OCCSs, offering a new choice for the treatment of femoral neck fracture.

J	Kozakiewicz, M; Swiniarski, J				Kozakiewicz, Marcin; Swiniarski, Jacek			"A" shape plate for open rigid internal fixation of mandible condyle neck fracture	JOURNAL OF CRANIO-MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article						Mandibular condyle neck; Fracture treatment; A-shape plate	FINITE-ELEMENT-ANALYSIS; OPEN REDUCTION; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; MODEL	Introduction: Reduction of the fracture is crucial for proper outcome of the treatment. The stability of reduction is closed connected to the method of its fixation. The topic of condylar fracture osteosynthesis still remains highly controversial and challenging. That is why authors decided to propose novel design of the fixating plate and the example of its application. The aim of this study was to present A-shape plate dedicated to rigid fixation of mandible condyle neck fracture. Material and methods: A-shape condylar plate (ACP) design is prepared of 1.0 mm thick titanium alloy (grade 5) sheet: posterior and anterior bars are reinforced by widening to 2.5 mm and anatomically curved along the compression and traction lines in ramus and condylar neck. Superior three-hole-group has triangular organization and located on the level of condylar head. The inferior extensions of the bars are equipped in three holes located at each of lower tails. Connecting bar (2.0 mm wide) connects the first hole of each lower tails closing upper part of ACP in triangular shape. The connecting bar runs along compression line of condylar neck. Holes in ACP has 2.0 mm diameter for locking or normal screws. Height of ACP is 31 mm. The proposed new type of plate was compared by finite element analysis (FEA) to nowadays manufactured 9-hole trapezoid plate as the most similar device. ACP design was evaluated by finite element analysis (FEA) and later applied in patient affected with high condylar neck fracture complicated by fracture of coronoid process. Results: FEA revealed high strength of ACP and more stabile fixation than trapezoid plate. The result was caused by multipoint fixation at three regions of the plate and reinforced bars supported by semihorizontal connecting bar. Clinical application of ACP was as versatile as makes possible to simultaneous fixation of high condylar neck and coronoid process fracture. Conclusion: Application of proposed A-shape condylar plate would be possible in all levels of neck fractures and can be use for stabilization additionally existed coronoid process fracture.

These techniques provide doctors with more opportunities to treat TB in the early stages of the disease. Traditional aggressive debridement surgery increases the risk of surgical complications. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether using percutaneous pedicle screw (PPS) fixation alone for the treatment of early spinal TB was a valid and less invasive surgical technique. Material/Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and radiographic outcomes in cases with thoracic or lumbar TB treated with PPS surgery or hybrid surgery between January 2010 and January 2017. The operative time, blood loss, length of hospital stay, and hospitalization costs in the 2 groups were recorded and compared. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) before and at 18 months after surgery were tested to evaluate TB progress. Back pain was measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) before the operation and at the final follow-up. Radiological outcomes were evaluated at 1, 6, 12, and 18 months after surgery. A paired t-test was used to evaluate preoperative and postoperative clinical outcomes using SPSS 19.0 software. P values less than 0.05 were considered to be significant. Results: A total of 42 patients were involved in this retrospective study. In both groups, the average preoperative ESR, CRP level, and VAS score for back pain significantly decreased after surgery. In the PPS group, the operative time, blood loss, hospital stay, and hospitalization costs were all significantly lower than those in the hybrid group. X-ray and CT images showed satisfactory bone fusion and good maintenance of spinal alignment in both groups at the final follow-up. Conclusions: PPS fixation alone was a valid and less invasive surgery for the treatment of early spinal TB. Furthermore, the recovery process of spinal TB can be facilitated using a "simple" internal fixation procedure, and bone fusion can be achieved without aggressive debridement and bone graft surgery.

J	Wang, R; Liu, YF; Wang, JH; Baur, DA				Wang, Russell; Liu, Yunfeng; Wang, Joanne Helen; Baur, Dale Allen			Effect of interfragmentary gap on the mechanical behavior of mandibular angle fracture with three fixation designs: A finite element analysis	JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY			English	Article						Mandibular angle fracture; Interfragmentary gap; Fixation designs; Finite element analysis; Stress distribution	INTERNAL-FIXATION; MANAGEMENT; COMPLICATIONS; STABILITY; OUTCOMES; REGION; BONE; SIZE	Background: The aim of this study was to simulate stress and strain distribution numerically on a normal mandible under physiological occlusal loadings. The results were compared with those of mandibles that had an angle fracture stabilized with different fixation designs under the same loadings. The amount of displacement at two interfragmentary gaps was also studied. Materials and methods: A three-dimensional (3D) virtual mandible was reconstructed with an angle fracture that had a fracture gap of either 0.1 or 1 mm. Three types of plate fixation designs were used: Type I, a miniplate was placed across the fracture line following the Champy technique; Type II, two miniplates were used; and Type III, a reconstruction plate was used on the inferior border of the mandible. Loads of 100 and 500 N were applied to the models. The maximum von Mises stress, strain, and displacement were computed using finite element analysis. The results from the control and experimental groups were analyzed and compared. Results: The results demonstrated that high stresses and strains were distributed to the condylar and angular areas regardless of the loading position. The ratio of the plate/bone average stress ranged from 215% (Type II design) to 848% (Type I design) irrespective of the interfragmentary gap size. With a 1-mm fracture gap, the ratio of the plate/bone stress ranged from 204% (Type II design) to 1130% (Type I design). All strains were well below critical bone strain thresholds. Displacement on the cross-sectional mapping at fracture interface indicated that uneven movement occurred in x, y, and z directions. Conclusions: Interfragmentary gaps between 0.1 and 1 mm did not have a substantial effect on the average stress distribution to the fractured bony segments; however, they had a greater effect on the stress distribution to the plates and screws. Type II fixation was the best mechanical design under bite loads. Type I design was the least stable system and had the highest stress distribution and the largest displacement at the fracture site.

Multiple drilling, fixation implant or autogenous osteochondral grafts are reported as treatment options. We present the midterm results of cases in which an OCD lesion was treated by osteochondral autograft transfer and drilling. Materials and Methods: Between 2002 and 2006, 14 knees with International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS-OCD) type II and III lesions were treated in our clinic using osteochondral autograft transfer and drilling by arthroscopic or open surgery. The average age of our patients was 22.14 years (range 17-29 years) and average followup was of 24.3 months (range 11-40 months). Lesion type was ICRS type II in five patients (35.7%) and ICRS type III in nine patients (64.3%). In cases with ICRS-OCD type II lesions, in situ fixation was applied following circumferential multiple drilling, while mosaicplasty was done following debridement and multiple drilling in cases with ICRS-OCD type III lesion. Mosaicplasty was performed in the lesion area by an average of 2.5 (range 1-3) cylindrical osteochondral autografts. Patients were not allowed to perform loading activities for 3 weeks in the postoperative period; movement was initiated by using CPM device in the early phase; full range of motion was achieved in third week, and full weight bearing was permitted in 6 to 8 weeks. Results: While 6 and 8 patients were classified preoperatively as fair and poor, respectively, according to Hughston scale, excellent and good results were obtained postoperatively in 10 and 4 patients, respectively. During the followup, no problems were detected in any of the patients in the regions where osteochondral graft was harvested. Conclusion: Biologic fixation or mosaicplasty and drilling as a technique to treatment of the lesion in OCD by osteochondral autograft transfer has resulted in good and excellent clinical outcomes in our patients and it is considered that providing blood flow to subchondral bone by circumferencial drilling leads to an increase in the robustness of biological internal fixation and shortens the duration of recovery.

Biomechanical comparison of the pullout strengths of C1 lateral mass screws and C1 posterior arch screws	SPINE JOURNAL			English	Article						Pullout strength; C1 lateral mass screws; C1 posterior arch screws	ATLANTOAXIAL FIXATION; FEASIBILITY; ARTHRODESIS; PLACEMENT; FUSION; ATLAS	BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Conditions of the atlantoaxial complex requiring internal stabilization can result from trauma, malignancy, inflammatory diseases, and congenital malformation. Several techniques have been used for stabilization and fusion. Posterior wiring is biomechanically inferior to screw fixation. C1 lateral mass screws and C1 posterior arch screws are used for instrumentation of the atlas. Previous studies have shown that unicortical C1 lateral mass screws are biomechanically stable for fixation. No study has evaluated the biomechanical stability of C1 posterior arch screws or compared the two techniques. PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to assess the differences in the pullout strength between C1 lateral mass screws and C1 posterior arch screws. STUDY DESIGN: Biomechanical testing of pullout strengths of the two atlantal screw fixation techniques. METHODS: Thirteen fresh human cadaveric C1 vertebrae were harvested, stripped of soft tissues, evaluated with computed tomography for anomalies, and instrumented with unicortical C1 lateral mass screws on one side and unicortical C1 posterior arch screws on the other. Screw placement was confirmed with postinstrumentation fluoroscopy. Specimens were divided in the sagittal plane and potted in polymethylmethacrylate. Axial load to failure was applied with a material testing device. Load displacement curves were obtained, and the results were compared with Student t test. DePuy Spine, Inc. (Raynham, MA, USA) provided the hardware used in this study. RESULTS: Mean pullout strength of the C1 lateral mass screws was 821 N (range 387-1,645 N +/- standard deviation [SD] 364). Mean pullout strength of the posterior arch screws was 1,403 N (range 483-2,200 N +/- SD 609 N). The difference was significant (p=.009). Five samples (38%) in the posterior arch group experienced bone failure before screw pullout. CONCLUSIONS: Both unicortical lateral mass screws and unicortical posterior arch screws are viable options for fixation in the atlas. Unicortical posterior arch screws have superior resistance to pullout via axial load compared with unicortical lateral mass screws in the atlas. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A Randomized Clinical Study	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							CONDYLAR FRACTURES; CLOSED TREATMENT; MINIPLATE; ETIOLOGY	Purpose: The management of the condyle fractures continue to be a source of perineal controversy in the field of oral and maxillofacial trauma. The aim of this study was to compare the surgical feasibility, functional outcome, and stability of fixation between the conventional miniplate and 3-dimensional plate in the management of adult mandibular unilateral subcondylar fractures. Materials and Methods: A prospective randomized clinical study with well-structured inclusion and exclusion criteria was carried out. Patients were allocated into Group A (Miniplates) and Group B (3-D Plates). The primary outcome variables were time taken for fixation, maximum mouth opening, occlusal stability, increase in angulation, and increase in the gap between fractured segments in the radiograph. The secondary outcome variables were needed for intermaxillary fixation (IMF) with guiding elastics and jaw movements. Statistical analysis was done using chi(2) test and student's t test with P value less than 0.05 indicating statistical significance. Results: Forty-four patients (40 male and 4 female) were enrolled, with 22 patients in each group. Time taken for fixation using 3-D plates was significantly lower than conventional miniplates (9.6 +/- 0.9 minutes with P value 0.001). Although clinical parameters showed improved results for Group B, there was no statistical significance. Radiological parameters ie increase in angulation, and increase in the gap, showed statistically significant results. Group A had significant increases in the angulation of the fractured condyle at the end of the third and sixth months with a P value of 0.008 and 0.0001, respectively. The gap between the fractured segments was significantly increased in Group A at the end of the first and third months, with a P value of 0.022 and 0.003, respectively. Conclusions: Our results concluded that 3-D plate offers superior fracture fragment stability and less displacement of the fractured segments. It has an added advantage of the ease of adaptation and shorter operating time.

Standard plate fixation is usually placed through an extended lateral approach with high risk for wound complications. Minimally invasive techniques might avoid wound complications but provide limited construct stability. Therefore, 2 different types of locking nails were developed to allow for minimally invasive technique with sufficient stability. The aim of this study was to quantify primary stability of minimally invasive calcaneal interlocking nail systems in comparison to a variable-angle interlocking plate. Material and Methods: After quantitative CT analysis, a standardized Sanders type IIB fracture model was created in 21 fresh-frozen cadavers. For osteosynthesis, 2 different interlocking nail systems (C-Nail; Medin, Nov. Mesto n. Morave, Czech Republic; Calcanail; FH Orthopedics SAS; Heimsbrunn, France) as well as a polyaxial interlocking plate (Rimbus; Intercus GmbH; Rudolstadt, Germany) were used. Biomechanical testing consisted of a dynamic load sequence (preload 20 N, 1000 N up to 2500 N, stepwise increase of 100 N every 100 cycles, 0.5 mm/s) and a load to failure sequence (max. load 5000 N, 0.5 mm/s). Interfragmentary movement was detected via a 3-D optical measurement system. Boehler angle was measured after osteosynthesis and after failure occurred. Results: No significant difference regarding load to failure, stiffness, Boehler angle, or interfragmentary motion was found between the different fixation systems. A significant difference was found with the dynamic failure testing sequence where 87.5% of the Calcanail implants failed in contrast to 14% of the C-Nail group (P < .01) and 66% of the Rimbus plate. The highest load to failure was observed for the C-Nail. Boehler angle showed physiologic range with all implants before and after the biomechanical tests. Conclusion: Both minimally invasive interlocking nail systems displayed a high primary stability that was not inferior to an interlocking plate. Clinical relevance: Based on our results, both interlocking nails appear to represent a viable option for treating displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures.

PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY			English	Article							HYDROXYAPATITE/POLY(L-LACTIDE) COMPOSITE RODS; INTERNAL-FIXATION; UNSINTERED HYDROXYAPATITE; BONE-FRACTURES; LONG-TERM; FLOOR; IMPLANTS; BEHAVIOR; DEFECTS	Background: Despite the popularity and superiority of resorbable alloplastic materials in orbital fracture reconstruction, it is unclear whether the reconstructed wall is maintained after implant resorption. Unsintered hydroxyapatite/poly-L-lactide (u-HA/PLLA) is one such material, but it differs from conventional materials for the replacement of natural bones. This study investigated the intermediate-term safety and efficacy of u-HA/PLLA implants compared with those of implants made with other alloplastic materials. Methods: The authors retrospectively analyzed 240 eligible patients who underwent orbital fracture reconstruction with one alloplastic material between January of 2006 and October of 2018. Materials used for treatment were as follows: u-HA/PLLA sheet in 101 patients, u-HA/PLLA mesh in 38 patients, poly-L-lactic acid/poly-glycolic acid mesh in 47 patients, silicone sheet in 35 patients, and titanium mesh in 19 patients. Intermediate-term follow-up was performed for a median duration of 48.2 months. A chart review was performed. Postoperative complications and factors affecting them were studied. Reconstructed area deformities were assessed using computed tomography. Results: Postoperative complications occurred significantly more frequently in patients reconstructed with the silicone sheet than in those reconstructed with the u-HA/PLLA sheet. Deformities were found for the silicone sheet (28.6 percent) and poly-L-lactic acid/poly-glycolic acid mesh (31.9 percent). These deformity rates were significantly higher than those for the u-HA/PLLA sheet. Conclusions: Compared with other alloplastic materials, u-HA/PLLA has low rates of postoperative complications and reconstructed area deformities. Because of its complete absorption, clinicians should consider using u-HA/PLLA as an alloplastic material for orbital wall reconstruction.

ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Ankle fracture; Medial mallelous; Open reduction internal fixation	DELTOID LIGAMENT; NONOPERATIVE TREATMENT; OPERATIVE TREATMENT; ANATOMICAL BASIS; BIMALLEOLAR; PAIN; CLASSIFICATION; VARIABILITY; STABILITY; INJURIES	Introduction It is unclear whether the medial malleolus in unstable bi- and tri- malleolar ankle fractures without medial talar displacement should be addressed surgically. This study reviews a fixation protocol for the medial malleolar component of unstable bi- or tri- malleolar ankle fractures. Materials and methods Two hundred fifty-seven patients who sustained bi- (AO/OTA 44-B2) or tri- (AO/OTA 44-B3) malleolar ankle fractures between January 2005 and August 2019 at two Level 1 trauma centers were retrospectively identified. Medial malleolar fractures were defined as anterior, supra or intercollicular fractures based on the exit of the posterior fracture line. Fixation of the medial malleolar component was performed based on surgical algorithm. Only large or significantly displaced medial malleolar fractures were fixed if the soft tissues were amenable. Primary outcome measure was the presence of medial-sided ankle pain after operative or non-operative treatment of the medial malleolar fracture after a minimum follow up of 6 months. Presence of pain was defined by a pain score of 3 or higher on a 10-point VAS pain score at the site of the medial malleolar fracture. Results Significantly more patients in the supracollicular group reported the presence of pain when this type was not fixed versus fixed (28 vs 14%, p = 0.0094). Significantly more patients in the anterior collicular subgroup reported the presence of pain when this type was fixed versus not fixed (40 vs 10%, p = 0.0438). There was no difference in the number of patients reporting pain in the intercollicular group when comparing those who were fixed versus not fixed, (21 vs 22%, p = 1.000). Conclusions When examining post-operative pain, not all medial malleolar fractures require fixation when appropriately selected based on fracture pattern. Only 10% of patients with anterior collicular fractures reported pain after non operative management. Unsurprisingly, more patients in the supracollicular fractures reported pain without surgery compared to with surgery. Fracture pattern should be considered in the treatment algorithm for the medial malleolar component in bi- and tri- malleolar fractures.

In this numerical study, 3D finite element models of the bone plate with low-stiffness material and traditional bone plates made of stainless steel and Ti alloy have been developed by using the ANSYS software. Stress analyses have been carried out for all three models under the same loading and boundary conditions. Compressive stresses occurring in the intact portion of the bone (tibia) and at the fractured interface at different stages of bone healing have been investigated for all three types of bone-plate systems. The results obtained have been compared and presented in graphs. It has been seen that the bone plate with low-stiffness material offers less stress-shielding to the bone, providing a higher compressive stress at the fractured interface to induce accelerated healing in comparison with Ti alloy and stainless-steel bone plate. In addition, the effects of low-stiffness materials with different Young's modulus on stress distribution at the fractured interface have been investigated in the newly developed bone-plate system. The results showed that when a certain value of Young's modulus of low-stiffness material is exceeded, increase in stiffness of the bone plate does not occur to a large extent and stress distributions and micro-motions at the fractured interface do not change considerably.

Treatment of type B periprosthetic femur fractures with curved non-locking plate with eccentric holes: Retrospective study of 43 patients with minimum 1-year follow-up	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Fracture; Femur; Prosthesis; Hip; ORIF; Plate	TOTAL HIP-ARTHROPLASTY; FEMORAL-SHAFT FRACTURES; VANCOUVER CLASSIFICATION; BIOMECHANICAL ANALYSIS; FIXATION; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; FRANCE; STEM	Introduction: Periprosthetic femur fracture (PFF) is a serious complication after total hip arthroplasty that can be treated using different internal fixation devices. However, the outcomes with curved non-locking plates with eccentric holes in this indication have not been reported previously. The objectives of this study were to determine: (1) the union rate; (2) the complication rate; (3) autonomy in a group of patients with a Vancouver type B PFF who were treated with this plate. Hypothesis: Use of this plate results in a high union rate with minimal mechanical complications. Materials and methods: Forty-three patients with a mean age of 79 years +/- 13 (41-98) who had undergone fixation of Vancouver type B PFF with this plate between 2002 and 2007 were included in the study. The time to union and Parker Mobility Score were evaluated. The revision-free survival (all causes) was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. The average follow-up was 42 months +/- 20 (16-90). Results: Union was obtained in all patients in a mean of 2.4 months +/- 0.6 (2-4). One patient had varus malunion of the femur. The Parker Mobility Score decreased from 5.93 +/- 1.94 (2-9) to 4.93 +/- 1.8 (1-9) (P=0.01). Two patients required a surgical revision: one for an infection after 4.5 years and one for stem loosening. The survival of the femoral stem 5 years after fracture fixation was 83.3% +/- 12.6%. Conclusion: Use of a curved plate with eccentric holes for treating type B PFF led to a high union rate and a low number of fixation-related complications. However, PFF remains a serious complication of hip arthroplasty that is accompanied by high morbidity and mortality rates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The proximity of neuro-vascular mediastinal structures makes open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) a high-risk procedure. The ideal treatment strategy is still debated. Our aim is to review the treatment of acute posterior sternoclavicular joint dislocation with a locking compression plate. Materials and methods We present our experience of transarticular plating using a locking compression plate for the treatment of three consecutive patients with posterior sternoclavicular dislocation (SCD). Our primary outcome measure was objective functional outcome using DASH (disability of the arm, shoulder and hand) and PROMIS (patient-reported outcomes measurement information system) questionnaires. All patients had a minimum follow-up of six months, and serial radiographs were reviewed to evaluate maintenance of reduction. Results All three patients presented a posterior SCD with instability refractory to closed reduction. In all three patients, we opted for surgical management using open reduction and fixation with a locking compression plate and allowed early mobilization at two weeks postoperatively. No complications were encountered during follow-up. Good functional outcomes were evidenced by DASH scores of 7.5, 20 and 30, and PROMIS scores were 53.8, 53.8 and 38.1 in each patient, respectively. Conclusion Our experience of transarticular plating using a locking compression plate for posterior SCD is positive, as it allows early mobilization and resulted in good functional outcomes.

These fractures are often open, contaminated, severely comminuted, and located adjacent to the antebrachiocarpal joint. There have been few studies to improve upon the methods of stabilization of this type of fracture. External coaptation incorporating tnasfixation pins is one method that has been used to stabilize distal radial fractures in horses (1-3). The purpose of this preliminary study was to compare the load to failure in simulated weight-bearing of a novel tapered-sleeve transfixation pin cost (TSTPC) (4) with the traditional transfixation pin cast (TPC) in an ex vivo distal radial fracture model. Ten adult equine cadaveric forelimbs were randomly placed into a TPC group (n = 5) or a TSTPC group (n = 5). An oblique distal radial osteotomy was created prior to application of fibreglass cost material. The limbs were loaded in a single cycle to failure in simulated weight-bearing using an axial load. The mean load to failure for the TSTPC group (35,814 N) was significantly greater than in the TPC group (22,344 N) (p = 0.003). Tapered sleeves in conjunction with TPC warrant further investigation because they may prolong the life of the fixation, prevent or diminish fractures through the pin sites, and increase the load capacity of external coaptation used to stabilize equine fractures.

The triceps-reflecting anconeus pedicle (TRAP) approach, combination of modified Kocher and Bryan-Money has been described as a conservative surgical exposure for fixation of the complex intercondylar fractures. Materials and methods: Eleven patients with intercondylar fractures of the humerus operated with this approach were reviewed. The mean follow-up was 26 (14-40) months. The aetiology of injuries was mostly fall on the elbow. There were five females and six males and the average age of the patients was 58.3 years (range 16-70 years). Results: According to Muller et al.'s classification; five were Type C1, four were Type C2 and, two were Type C3. At the final follow-up; Type C1 and C2 fractures had a ROM of 116 (range 95 degrees-140 degrees) and, Type C3 fractures had a ROM of 85 which showed limitation of elbow motion. Average humerotrochlear angle is 93.4 (range 90 degrees-98 degrees). Two patients had transient n.ulnaris paraesthesia and one had heterotopic ossification. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that TRAP approach is extensile enough in treating these complex fractures however both articular reconstruction and fixation can be easily managed without creating an olecranon fracture. No significant triceps weakness and dysfunction was observed after TRAP approach in the treatment of the intercondylar fractures of the humerus.

How fixation of a small posterior malleolar fragment neutralizes rotational forces in trimalleolar fractures	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Trimalleolar fracture; Computed tomography; Ankle; Fracture; Posterior malleolar fragment; Positioning screw; Osteosynthesis		Introduction This study investigated the effects of a small posterior malleolar fragment (PMF), containing less than 25% articular surface area, on ankle joint stability via computed tomography (CT) scanning under full weight bearing in a human cadaveric ankle fracture model. Materials and methods A trimalleolar fracture with a PMF of less than 25% articular surface area was created in 6 pairs of fresh-frozen human cadaveric lower legs. The specimens were randomized into 2 groups stabilized by internal fixation including a positioning screw for syndesmotic reconstruction. In Group I the PMF was addressed by direct screw osteosynthesis, whereas in Group II the fragment was not fixed. Six predefined distances within the ankle were measured under axial loading. CT scans of each specimen were performed in intact and fixated states in neutral position, dorsiflexion and plantar-flexion of the ankle. Results In plantar-flexion, significant differences were detected between the groups with regard to rotational instability. Group II demonstrated a significantly increased inward rotation of the fibula compared with Group I. No significant differences were detected between the groups for each one of the measured distances in any of the three foot positions. Conclusions Additional reduction and fixation of a small PMF seems to neutralize rotational forces in the ankle more effectively than a sole syndesmotic screw. Clinically, this becomes relevant in certain phases of the gait cycle. Direct screw osteosynthesis of a small PMF stabilizes the ankle more effectively than a positioning screw.

Currently locking plates are very popular because of their length preserving, stability. A considerable drawback is the high cost. Since 2003 we have been using mini AO plates (2.7 mm) as an alternative. We analysed our results and performed a cost analysis. Retrospective analysis was performed of all patients operated upon between 2003 and 2008 for C type distal radius fractures. Reduction was achieved with mini AO plates, applied in a buttress fashion, with ligamentotaxis. Rehabilitation consisted of immediate mobilisation. Pre- and postoperative X-rays, operative results and patient charts were reviewed. Furthermore, we prospectively evaluated the functional results using VAS, DASH and Mayo wrist scores. Lastly, we assessed the implant costs and compared them to locking plates. Thirty-four patients were treated with a mean age of 49 years. Mean radial shortening improved 2 mm; dorsal and radial angulation improved 23 and 4A degrees, respectively. At consolidation (eight weeks) the average radial shortening was 0.75 mm, a volar angulation of 3A degrees, and 21A degrees of radial angulation. Functional results were excellent, demonstrated by a mean VAS score less than 1, a DASH score of 12 and a Mayo wrist score of 87. Compared to locking plates, there was an overall reduction in material costs of 15,300 Euro. Our technique has excellent biomechanical stability, enabling immediate functional rehabilitation, good anatomical and functional outcome with significantly lower costs.

Materials and methods: We constructed three different fracture morphologies in the sagittal plane in Pauwels type III femoral neck fractures: posteriorly angled at 20 degrees, neutral, and anteriorly angled at 20 degrees. We set up four fixation devices, including three cannulated screws (3CS), a dynamic hip screw with an antirotational screw (DHS+CS), a proximal femoral locking plate (PFLP), and three cannulated screws with a medial buttress plate (3CS+MBP). The twelve models were created and analyzed using the finite element analysis. Results: The finite element analysis revealed that 3CS+MBP yields better results in total vertical and rotational displacements, regardless of the fracture angle in the sagittal plane. For the anterior and posterior angled fractures in the sagittal plane, the PFLP was superior to the DHS+CS. However, the DHS+CS exhibited less displacement than the PFLP in the neutral fracture line in the sagittal plane. The 3CS group demonstrated poor mechanical stability for Pauwels type III fractures. Conclusion: Regardless of the fracture line in the sagittal plane, the 3CS+MBP showed better biomechanical behaviors than the 3CS, DHS+CS, and PFLP. In addition, in contrast to the DHS+CS, the PFLP displayed less vertical and rotational displacement in the anterior and posterior fracture lines in the sagittal plane.

J	Wenger, D; Henning, H; Bergkvist, D; Rogmark, C				Wenger, Daniel; Henning, Hampus; Bergkvist, Dan; Rogmark, Cecilia			Fewer reoperations after posterolateral plate positioning compared with lateral plate positioning in ankle fractures-a retrospective study on 453 AO/OTA 44-B injuries	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Ankle; Fracture; Reoperation; Complication; Posterolateral; Anti-glide; Lateral; Neutralisation; Plate	COMPLICATIONS; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Introduction: Ankle fractures are commonly treated by open reduction and internal fixation with plate and screws. Unplanned return to theatre is common, in many cases to extract prominent osteosynthesis material from the lateral malleolus as swelling subsides. We hypothesised that patients operated with a posterolateral plate placement on the lateral malleolus would have fewer reoperations, and fewer com-plications, compared to patients with a lateral plate placement. Materials and Methods: From a prospectively collected database of all orthopaedic surgery performed at our institution, we identified 664 ankle fractures undergoing plate fixation between 2008-01-01 and 2012-04-30. Radiographs were analysed to only include AO/OTA 44-B-fractures (n = 453), and to de -fine study groups based on plate positioning. Hospital files were assessed to identify possible confound-ing factors, and any unplanned reoperation or complication. Complications were classified according to Dindo-Clavien. Results: The risk of reoperation was 13% after posterolateral plating, compared with 24% after lateral plating; absolute risk reduction 10% (95% CI: 2.5-18), p = 0.02. After adjusting for possible confounders, the odds ratio of undergoing reoperation after lateral plating was 2.2 (95% CI: 1.17-4.1), p = 0.01. The two surgical methods did not differ with regard to complication frequency: 31% vs 34%, p = 0.6, but complications following lateral plate fixation were more serious, p = 0.03. Plate positioning depended on surgeon preference. Discussion: The two studied methods are both considered standard treatment of ankle fractures, and rela-tively simple surgical procedures. High rates of secondary surgery after plate fixation have been reported, but no study comparing plate positioning has been previously published to our knowledge. AO Sweden has recently switched to teaching posterolateral plating in group exercises during the AO Basic Fracture Surgery course, based on the belief that it may be safer than lateral plating. Our findings support this change in practice. Conclusions: Posterolateral plate positioning on the lateral malleolus in AO/OTA 44-B-fractures may be preferential to lateral plate positioning, due to a large difference in unplanned secondary surgery.

Radiological Outcome of Short Segment Posterior Stabilisation and Fusion in Thoracolumbar Spine Acute Fracture	ANNALS ACADEMY OF MEDICINE SINGAPORE			English	Article						Kyphoytic angle; Radiological outcome; Short segment posterior fixation; Thoracolumbar spine fractures	LUMBAR SPINE; BURST FRACTURES; PEDICLE INSTRUMENTATION; NONOPERATIVE TREATMENT; INTERNAL-FIXATION; THORACIC SPINE; INJURIES; DISLOCATIONS; MANAGEMENT; ROTATION	Introduction: The optimal management of thoracolumbar spine fractures remains a matter of controversy. The current literature implies that the use of short-segment pedicle screw fixation may be inappropriate because of its high reported failure rate. The purpose of this study is to report the short-term results of thoracolumbar burst and compression fractures treated with short-segment pedicle instrumentation. Materials and Methods: From 2002 to 2007, 19 patients with thoracolumbar acute traumatic fractures were instrumented with posterior short-segment pedicle screws. The patients' case notes, operation records, preoperative and postoperative radiographs (sagittal index, anterior body compression and regional kyphosis), computed tomography scans, neurological findings (Frankel functional classification), and follow-up records up to 18 months were reviewed. Results: A statistically significant difference was found between the patients' preoperative, postoperative and follow-up sagittal index, anterior body compression and regional kyphosis measurement. One case resulted in screw pedicle screw pullout and subsequently, kyphotic deformity. The patient underwent revision surgery to long-segment posterior instrumentation and fusion. None of the patients showed an increase in neurological deficit. Conclusion: In conclusion, the short-term follow-up results suggest a favourable outcome for short-segment instrumentation. Load shearing classification is essential for the selection of patient for short-segment instrumentation. However, the long-term follow-up evaluation will be needed to verify our findings.

Objective: The present study aimed to assess medium-term results of minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) in distal radius fracture. Material and methods: The series comprised of 710 cases (512 female; mean age, 58 years). The 15 mm approach was on the lateral edge of the FCR. The plate was slipped under the pronator quadratus. Closure used intradermal running suture without drain or orthosis. Results: At a mean 7 months' follow-up, mean scar length was 17 mm (range, 10-40 mm), pain 1.13/10 (0-8), Quick-DASH 13.28 (0-86.36), and patient-rated wrist evaluation (PRWE) 11.48 (0-91). Compared to contralateral values, mean flexion was 87.23%, extension 88.52%, pronation 96.17%, supination 93.41%, and grip strength 79.68%. Hardware was removed in 45.92% of cases. There were 16 cases of secondary displacement, with 4 revision procedures, one of sepsis at 6 months, 10 of complex regional pain syndrome, and 14 of median nerve paresthesia, with 4 carpal tunnel release procedures. Discussion: The minimally invasive FCR approach can be used for volar plate fixation of distal radial fracture. It has the advantage of conserving ligamentotaxis, facilitating reduction and improving scar esthetics. The incision can be extended if need be. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The objective was to assess the outcomes of volar locking plate for displaced complete intra-articular distal radius fractures in elderly as compared to younger patients. Hypothesis: The outcomes in elderly patients would be comparable with those in younger patients with a low rate of complications. Material and methods: Non-randomised prospective comparative study between 70 patients older than 65 years and 46 younger patients with AO type-C fractures. The main outcome was Disabilities Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score. Secondary variables were Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) score, range of motion, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain, and grip strength. Radiological measurements were also performed. Results: The mean follow-up was 30.9 (range, 24-53) months. There were no significant differences in mean DASH, PRWE, VAS-pain, wrist motion or radiological parameters at final follow-up. Multivariate analysis showed that the functional outcomes were significantly influenced by baseline ulnar positivity greater than 3 mm at baseline but not by age. Discussion: The study hypothesis was confirmed. Surgical treatment with volar locking plate for displaced complete intra-articular fractures of the distal radius in elderly patients represents a safe and effective treatment alternative with similar early complication rate than in younger.

Materials and Methods: This was a consecutive case series during a 30-year period performed by a single surgeon at several practice locations using the technique of extraoral plating at the inferior border. All patients were prospectively monitored clinically and radiographically for achievement of bony union and for complications of sensory disturbances of the lower lip, delayed healing, and hardware removal. The mean observation time was 23.1 months (range 1 to 60), with only 2 cases observed for less than 6 months. Results: All the patients achieved clinical union of their fractures. Two cases of fibrous union did not reach ossification until 5 months after surgery. The hardware removal rate was 13.6%, and the infection/prolonged inflammation rate was 13.6%. There was 1 case of malunion. Those patients who had dentures were able to return to denture wearing postoperatively. Conclusions: Miniplate fixation of fractures of the severely atrophic mandible at the inferior border is safe and effective.

Materials and methods 88 patients who underwent plate fixation for proximal humerus fractures were enrolled. The patients were randomly divided into two groups, with Group I receiving a glenohumeral injection of triamcinolone 8 weeks postoperatively and Group II receiving no injection postoperatively. Outcomes were measured and compared based on the range of motion (ROM) and functional scores. Follow-up outcomes were assessed at initial, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively and at the last follow-up. Shoulder trauma series were taken at every visit to evaluate the fracture healing. The mean follow-up period was 25.37 (+/- 3.85) months Group I and 24.24 (+/- 6.23) months for group II. Results In both groups, the final outcome of the ROM and functional outcome was significantly better at last F/U than at postoperative 8 weeks. Group I had significantly better results than Group II at postoperative 3 and 6 month in terms of forward flexion, external rotation, and VAS for pain. Also, Group I showed better performance in terms of ASES and Constant score at postoperative 3 months. The fracture union rate did not differ between Groups I and II. Conclusions Postoperative glenohumeral injection of triamcinolone is a safe and effective treatment modality for shoulder stiffness after internal fixation of proximal humerus fractures during the early period of rehabilitation.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical-radiological results of a group of patients with a bascervical proximal femoral fractures treated with Percutaneous Compression Plate (PCCP). Material and methods: Among 5817 patients with a hip fracture who were admitted in our hospital from January 2005 to December 2017, 234 factures (4%) were diagnosed of basicervical femoral fracture. 30 of them were treated with a PCCP, 22 women and 8 men, mean age was 81.2 years (63-94). Demographic and perioperative variables were collected. The patients were followed up at 1, 3 and 6 months clinically and radiologically. Results: There were no intra-operative complications and no conversions to open surgery. There was no early implant failure. No surgical wound infection was diagnosed. Crude mortality was 13% the first year and 87% were able to walk at the 6 months. The last follow-up x-rays revealed 97% fracture healing and the collapse at fracture site occurred in 4 hips. No instances of cut-out were observed. In one case, a fatigue failure of the lag screws of a PCCP plate was observed at 3 months from osteosynthesis. Conclusion: PCCP is an appropriated implant for basicervical femoral neck fractures. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, the mechanical strength of this plate system is unclear. Thus, the aim of this in vitro study was to assess its tensile and shear strength and evaluate the biomechanical intensity of different osteosynthesis plate designs after sagittal split ramus osteotomy by simulating masticatory forces in a clinical setting. For tensile and shear strength analyses, three mechanical strength measurement samples were prepared by fixing unsintered hydroxyapatite/poly-L-lactide composed plates to polycarbonate skeletal models. Regarding biomechanical loading evaluation, 12 mandibular replicas were used and divided into four groups for sagittal split ramus osteotomy fixation. Each sample was secured in a jig and subjected to vertical load on the first molar teeth. Regarding shear strength, the novel-shaped unsintered hydroxyapatite/poly-L-lactide plate had significantly high intensity. Upon biomechanical loading evaluation, this plate system also displayed significantly high stability in addition to bioactivity, with no observed plate fracture. Thus, we have clearly demonstrated the efficacy of this plate system using an in vitro model of bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy of the mandible.

Traction followed by a plaster cast is universally accepted as conservative treatment. We compared primary hip spica with closed reduction and fixation with retrogradely passed crossed Rush pins for diaphyseal femur fracture in children. The hypothesis was that Rush pin might provide better treatment with good clinical results in comparison with primary hip spica. Materials and Methods: Fifty children with femoral fractures were evaluated; 25 of them underwent conservative treatment using immediate hip spica (group A) and 25 were treated with crossed retrograde Rush pins (group B). The patients ages ranged from 3 to 13 years (mean of 9 years). Results: Mean duration of fracture union was 15 weeks in group A and 12 weeks in group B. Mean duration of weight bearing 14 weeks in group and 7 weeks in group B. Mean hospital stay was 4 days in group A and 8 days in group B. Mean followup period in group A was 16 months and group B was 17 months. Complications such as angulation, shortening, infection were compared. Conclusions: Closed reduction and internal fixation with crossed Rush pins was superior in terms of early weight bearing and restoration of normal anatomy.

Fabrication and mechanical properties of PLLA/PCL/HA composites via a biomimetic, dip coating, and hot compression procedure	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							SIMULATED BODY-FLUID; APATITE-FORMING ABILITY; SURFACE MODIFICATION; ELASTIC-MODULUS; TRABECULAR BONE; BIODEGRADABLE POLYMERS; POLY(ETHYLENE GLYCOL); INTERNAL-FIXATION; POLYAMIDE FILMS; CARBOXYL GROUP	Currently, the bone-repair biomaterials market is dominated by high modulus metals and their alloys. The problem of stress-shielding, which results from elastic modulus mismatch between these metallic materials and natural bone, has stimulated increasing research into the development of polymer-ceramic composite materials that can more closely match the modulus of bone. In this study, we prepared poly(l-lactic acid)/hydroxyapatite/poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PLLA/HA/PCL) composites via a four-step process, which includes surface etching of the fiber, the deposition of the HA coating onto the PLLA fibers through immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF), PCL coating through a dip-coating process, and hot compression molding. The initial HA-coated PLLA fiber had a homogeneous and continuous coating with a gradient structure. The effects of HA: PCL ratio and molding temperature on flexural mechanical properties were studied and both were shown to be important to mechanical properties. Mechanical results showed that at low molding temperatures and up to an HA: PCL volume ratio of 1, the flexural strain decreased while the flexural modulus and strength increased. At higher mold temperatures with a lower viscosity of the PCL a HA: PCL ratio of 1.6 gave similar properties. The process successfully produced composites with flexural moduli near the lower range of bone. Such composites may have clinical use for load bearing bone fixation.	[Charles, L.

Titanium mesh osteosynthesis for the treatment of severely comminuted maxillofacial fractures in four dogs	JOURNAL OF SMALL ANIMAL PRACTICE			English	Article							MAXILLARY FRACTURES; RECONSTRUCTION; FIXATION; SEIZURES; REPAIR; TRAUMA; STEEL	Introduction Major goals in maxillofacial fracture treatment include to restore the dental occlusion, stabilise the major skeletal supports, restore the contour of the face and achieve proper function and appearance of the face. Titanium is considered an optimal material for maxillofacial reconstruction due to its biocompatibility, high strength, minimal inflammatory reaction and minimal imaging artefact. Objectives To describe the clinical details, surgical technique, pre- and postoperative imaging and short- and long-term follow-up of severely comminuted maxillofacial fractures treated with titanium mesh and titanium screws in dogs. Materials and Methods Retrospective short case series included four client-owned dogs with maxillofacial fractures. After appropriate medical stabilisation, preoperative CT examination of the head was obtained in all patients for evaluation of fracture configuration and surgical planning. The maxillofacial fractures were stabilised by titanium mesh osteosynthesis. Short- and long-term clinical and radiographic follow-ups were available for all dogs. Results Proper dental occlusion and reconstruction of the anatomic buttresses was achieved in all cases. All dogs recovered uneventfully from the surgery and no complications were recorded on the long-term follow-up up to 43 months. Occlusion was maintained in all dogs, as well as excellent cosmesis of the midface. Clinical Significance Titanium mesh osteosynthesis can achieve sufficient rigidity and lead to uncomplicated healing of severely comminuted maxillofacial fractures. This internal fixation method can be considered a valuable option to treat maxillofacial fractures in particular in cases of large bone defect and midface reconstruction.

Precise evaluation of the mechanical stresses that develop in a fractured mandible is essential, particularly for the testing of systems currently used for stabilisation of the condylar fragment. Photoelastic stress analysis can be used to visualise alterations in the strain that is induced in the mandible by a fracture, and in the osteosynthesis materials used to stabilise it. This method, used on currently used osteosynthesis materials, showed that stabilisation of a subcondylar fracture with a single miniplate does not provide enough stability, whereas the use of two miniplates - properly positioned - offers sufficient stability in all loading conditions. A microplate may be used as a tension-resisting plate with equally good results. (C) 2011 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Material and Methods: The basic material consisted of population-based data set of patients aged 65 years or older who had sustained a hip fracture and were treated operatively between 1999 and 2000. Out of these, we identified 266 consecutive patients with cervical hip fracture. Results: The age-adjusted incidence of cervical hip fractures in women was 1.3-fold compared to men. In age-adjusted analysis, occurrence of chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease or 2-5 comorbidities, male gender, the need for 2-person mobility assistance, and poor ambulation postoperatively were associated with excess mortality at least at one evaluation point. Conclusions: Only chronic lung disease and male gender were independent predictors of increased mortality at each follow-up assessment in multivariate analysis.

J	Kobayashi, S; Yamaji, S				Kobayashi, Satoshi; Yamaji, Shusaku			Analytical prediction of hydrolysis behavior of tricalcium phosphate/poly-L-lactic acid composites in simulated body environment	ADVANCED COMPOSITE MATERIALS			English	Article						poly-L-lactic acid; tricalcium phosphate; hydrolysis; biomaterials; composite material	HYDROXYAPATITE HA PARTICLES; BIORESORBABLE DEVICES; FORGED COMPOSITES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; BONE-FRACTURES; IN-VIVO; DEGRADATION; STRENGTH; POLY(L-LACTIDE); PLLA	Bioactive ceramics/poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) composites have been expected as a material for bone fracture fixations which have more biocompatibility than monolithic PLLA. In this study, monolithic PLLA and beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP)/PLLA composites containing three different beta-TCP contents (5, 10, 15 wt%) were prepared by injection molding and hydrolysis behavior in simulated body environment was characterized. The specimens were immersed in phosphate buffered solution to measure water absorption and molecular weight of the specimen. Water absorption in monolithic PLLA increased with increasing immersion time up to 14 days, and then saturated, whereas water absorption in composites increased with increasing immersion time up to 168 days. The composites with higher beta-TCP content showed larger water absorption. Degradation of number averaged molecular weight for the composites became faster with beta-TCP content at the same immersion time. Number averaged molecular weight of 15 wt% composites decreased from 60,000 to 39,000 after 24 weeks immersion. Two layers and three layers models were proposed to predict water absorption and number average molecular weight variation, respectively. To predict hydrolysis behavior of bioactive ceramics/PLLA composites more precisely, effect of water diffusion was considered in the proposed models. Predictions based on the present models were in good agreement with experimental results and the effectiveness of the models was confirmed.

The aim of this study was to test if these changes in screw geometry are increasing the strength of the pedicle screw fixation after repeated insertion. METHODS: Three different types of pedicle screws were inserted in rigid foam blocks. Tightening torque and pull-out strength were measured during two repetitive insertions of a standard 6.5x45-mm conical screw. The third insertion into the pilot hole was performed using either standard 6.5x45-mm or 7.2x45-mm conical screws or the novel 6.5x45-mm (6T) screw. Additionally, we performed a surface analysis to investigate the bone/screw interface. RESULTS: The maximal tightening torque at the third insertion of the novel 6T screw was 194% higher compared to the standard 6.5x45-mm conical screw and 135% higher compared to the standard 7.2x45-mm conical screw. The pull-out strength of the 6T screw showed no significant changes, and surface analysis revealed a compression of the screw-foam interface due to the different internal diameters. CONCLUSIONS: The modified geometrical design of the 6T screw seems to have no statistically significant effect on the pull-out strength, although it achieved a higher tightening torque. This might be due to the different pitch angle cutting a new thread into the material and also to the enlarged inner diameter.

Chest Wall Injury Society Recommendations for Management of Surgical Site or Implant-Related Infections After Surgical Stabilization of Traumatic Rib or Sternal Fractures	SURGICAL INFECTIONS			English	Article						antibiotic agents; implant; infection; rib fractures; surgery; trauma	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; FLAIL CHEST; INTERNAL-FIXATION; HARDWARE; OUTCOMES; PAIN	Background: Surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) and surgical stabilization of sternal fractures (SSSF) involves open reduction and internal fixation of fractures with an implantable titanium plate to restore and maintain anatomic alignment. The presence of this foreign, non-absorbable material presents an opportunity for infection. Although surgical site infection (SSI) and implant infection rates after SSRF and SSSF are low, they present a challenging clinical entity.Methods: The Surgical Infection Society's Therapeutics and Guidelines Committee and Chest Wall Injury Society's Publication Committee convened to develop recommendations for management of SSIs or implant-related infections after SSRF or SSSF. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane database were searched for pertinent studies. Using a process of iterative consensus, all committee members voted to accept or reject each recommendation.Results: For patients undergoing SSRF or SSSF who develop an SSI or an implant-related infection, there is insufficient evidence to suggest a single optimal management strategy. For patients with an SSI, systemic antibiotic therapy, local wound debridement, and vacuum-assisted closure have been used in isolation or combination. For patients with an implant-related infection, initial implant removal with or without systemic antibiotic therapy, systemic antibiotic therapy with local wound drainage, and systemic antibiotic therapy with local antibiotic therapy have been documented. For patients who do not undergo initial implant removal, 68% ultimately require implant removal to achieve source control.Conclusions: Insufficient evidence precludes the ability to recommend guidelines for the treatment of SSI or implant-related infection following SSRF or SSSF. Further studies should be performed to identify the optimal management strategy in this population.

BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS			English	Article						Traumatic proximal femur fractures; Polytrauma; Nonunion; Delayed union; Risk factors; Non-geriatric	INTERTROCHANTERIC HIP-FRACTURES; DISTAL FEMORAL FRACTURES; TROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; DELAYED UNION; NONUNION; SALVAGE; SHAFT; NAIL; STABILIZATION	Background/purposeImpaired healing is a feared complication with devastating outcomes for each patient. Most studies focus on geriatric fracture fixation and assess well known risk factors such as infections. However, risk factors, others than infections, and impaired healing of proximal femur fractures in non-geriatric adults are marginally assessed. Therefore, this study aimed to identify non-infection related risk factors for impaired fracture healing of proximal femur fractures in non-geriatric trauma patients.MethodsThis study included non-geriatric patients (aged 69 years and younger) who were treated between 2013 and 2020 at one academic Level 1 trauma center due to a proximal femur fracture (PFF). Patients were stratified according to AO/OTA classification. Delayed union was defined as failed callus formation on 3 out of 4 cortices after 3 to 6 months. Nonunion was defined as lack of callus-formation after 6 months, material breakage, or requirement of revision surgery. Patient follow up was 12 months.ResultsThis study included 150 patients. Delayed union was observed in 32 (21.3%) patients and nonunion with subsequent revision surgery occurred in 14 (9.3%). With an increasing fracture classification (31 A1 up to 31 A3 type fractures), there was a significantly higher rate of delayed union. Additionally, open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) (OR 6.17, (95% CI 1.54 to 24.70, p <= 0.01)) and diabetes mellitus type II (DM) (OR 5.74, (95% CI 1.39 to 23.72, p = 0.016)), were independent risk factors for delayed union. The rate of nonunion was independent of fracture morphology, patient's characteristics or comorbidities.ConclusionIncreasing fracture complexity, ORIF and diabetes were found to be associated with delayed union of intertrochanteric femur fractures in non-geriatric patients. However, these factors were not associated with the development of nonunion.

A preliminary experimental study	JOURNAL OF STOMATOLOGY ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article						Miniplates; Mandible fracture; Mandibular osteotomy; Implant removal; Experimental study	FACIAL TRAUMA; ORTHOGNATHIC SURGERY; TOTAL HIP; REMOVAL; RECIDIVISM; FRACTURES; PLATE	Introduction: Whether to conserve or remove titanium miniplates after rigid internal fixation of mandibular fractures still remains controversial. Miniplates could affect the biomechanical behaviour of the mandible in case of trauma, and therefore cause more complex fractures. Materials and methods: An experimental study, consisting in simulating a mandibular trauma, was designed in order to compare the fractures caused by an impact on the mandible in the presence or absence of an internal fixation. We simulated an impact on the right parasymphysis region in 10 post-mortem human subjects, according to the Charpy impact test method at an impact speed of 7.4 m/s, using a 5 kg test impactor. Results: In the control group, the fracture lines were vertical and straight, without comminution. In the miniplate group, the fractures occurred close to the miniplates (4 cases) and under the miniplates (one case). The fracture lines were more complex, even comminuted in 2 cases. Thus, miniplates impacted the biomechanical behavior of the mandible, resulting in more complex fractures. Conclusion: Our experimental study highlighted the impact of the presence of miniplates on the mandible in case of trauma, and the risk of causing more complex fractures. We therefore recommend further investigations to determine if titanium miniplates should be systematically removed after bone healing, in patients with a higher risk of trauma in relation with previous assault injuries, alcohol or substance abuse, the practice of fighting or contact sport/activities, and soldiers.

All patients underwent posterior thoracolumbar open reduction and fixation using this technique. Preoperative x-ray, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging were used to evaluate the dislocation. The American Spinal Injury Association grade of spinal cord injury before and afer the operation were record. All patients were followed up for 2 years, and x-ray, CT were used to observe postoperative reduction and fusion.Results:Postoperative x-ray and CT images of all patients indicated good recovery of the spinal sequence, and no neurological deterioration or surgically related complications occurred. All patients were followed up for 2 years, no patients were lost to follow-up. During the follow-up period, x-ray and CT images showed no complications related to internal fixation such as fracture and loosening of screws and rods were found.Conclusion:A anchoring technique using long bent rods is a safe, simple, accurate, and easy to replicate and implement method, which can be applied in the surgical treatment for thoracolumbar dislocation.

Talonavicular Joint Fixation Using Augmenting Naviculocalcaneal Screw in Modified Double Hindfoot Arthrodesis	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Talonavicular Arthrodesis; Triple Arthrodesis; Modified Double Arthrodesis; Talonavicular Nonunion; Biomechanical Stability; Naviculocalcaneal Screw	SINGLE MEDIAL APPROACH; TRIPLE ARTHRODESIS; INTERNAL-FIXATION; DEFORMITY; SUBTALAR; DISEASE; ADULTS	Background: Triple arthrodesis and combined talonavicular/subtalar arthrodesis are procedures for hindfoot disorders. Achieving talonavicular joint fusion can be problematic. We hypothesized that talonavicular joint fixation bending stiffness could be increased by adding a fully-threaded screw inserted through the lateral navicular into the calcaneus. Materials and Methods: We used ten fresh-frozen cadaver hindfeet. The calcaneus and talus were immobilized, and talonavicular joint stripped of cartilage. Two partially-threaded 4.5-mm cannulated screws were placed across the talonavicular joint, one traversing the central third of the navicular and a second through the medial third of the navicular. We quantified talonavicular fixation bending stiffness and angulation in response to 4N-m bending moments applied to the navicular in four directions: plantar-to-dorsal (P-D), medial-to-lateral (M-L), dorsal-to-plantar (D-P), and lateral-to-medial (L-M). An augmenting fully-threaded 4.5 mm cannulated screw was then placed through the lateral third of the navicular into the calcaneus and the specimens retested. Results: The mean bending stiffness in each direction increased significantly after addition of the third screw. The stiffness increase in each direction was: P-D 92%, D-P 39%, L-M 108%, and M-L 56%. Correspondingly, mean talonavicular angulation significantly decreased in each direction: P-D 43%, D-P 28%, L-M 47%, and M-L 34%. Conclusion: A third, fully-threaded screw from the lateral navicular into the calcaneus significantly increases talonavicular bending stiffness and decreases angulation. Clinical Relevance: The increased resistance to arthrodesis site motion afforded by the addition of a naviculocalcaneal screw may improve the likelihood of achieving successful talonavicular fusion in combined talonavicular/subtalar arthrodesis.

ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Tip-apex distance; Concordance of measurements; TAD; Pertrochanteric fracture; Secondary displacement	INTERTROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; FAILURE; PREDICTORS; CUTOUT; FEMUR	Introduction: The tip-apex distance (TAD) is the only predictor for mechanical failure after internal fixation of trochanteric fractures. The main objective of our study was to assess whether the intraoperative visual estimation of the TAD concurred with the measurement taken on postoperative digital X-rays. We hypothesized that there was a good concordance between these 2 different methods of measurement. Materials and methods: Patients with an isolated trochanteric fracture were included in our study. A hardcopy of the intraoperative X-rays were printed, and the TAD was calculated manually. Radiological and clinical follow-ups were scheduled at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months during which numerical measurements of the TAD were taken. We also recorded the fracture type (AO/OTA classification), degree of osteoporosis (Singh index), surgeon experience, age and ASA score. Results: A total of 98 patients were included in our study. Of these, 70 had a 6-month follow-up and interpretable postoperative X-rays. The mean age was 87 years, with 77.14% women and a mean ASA score of 3. The coefficient of concordance between the intra and postoperative TAD was 0.7202 (95% CI = 0.4905-0.9499). The secondary displacement rate was 3.28%. The univariate analysis showed no statistically significant association between an intraoperative TAD > 25 mm and fracture type (p = 0.7290), degree of osteoporosis (p = 0.5701) and surgeon experience (p = 1). Discussion/Conclusions: There was a high degree of concordance between intraoperative visual estimation of the TAD and its measurement on postoperative digital X-rays. The treatment of unstable fractures in osteoporotic bone by junior surgeons was not a risk factor for intraoperative TAD > 25 mm. It is therefore important to educate young surgeons on the concept of TAD and its intraoperative visual estimation technique as it ensures that the cephalic screw is positioned properly during the fixation of trochanteric fractures.

Materials and Methods: Imaging of 6 cadaveric wrists with artificial scaphoid fractures and different fixation screws was performed in 2 screw positions (45- and 90-orientation in relation to the x/y-axis) using multidetector CT (MDCT) and 2 flat-panel CT modalities, C-arm flat-panel CT (FPCT) and cone-beam CT (CBCT), the latter 2 with low and standard radiation dose protocols. Mean cartilage attenuation and metal artifact-induced absolute Hounsfield unit changes (= artifact extent) were measured. Two independent radiologists evaluated different image quality criteria using a 5-point Likert-scale. Interreader agreements (Cohen kappa) were calculated. Mean absolute Hounsfield unit changes and quality ratings were compared using Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Results: Artifact extent was significantly smaller for MDCT and standard-dose FPCT compared with CBCT low-and standard-dose acquisitions (all P < 0.05). No significant differences in artifact extent among different screw types and scanning positions were noted (P 9 0.05). Both MDCT and FPCT standard dose protocols showed equal ratings for screw bone interface, fracture line, and trabecular bone evaluation (P = 0.06, 0.2, and 0.2, respectively) and performed significantly better than FPCT low-and CBCT low-and standard-dose acquisitions (all P G 0.05). Good interreader agreement was found for image quality comparisons (Cohen J = 0.76-0.78). Conclusions: Both MDCT and FPCT standard-dose acquisition showed comparatively less metal-induced artifacts and better overall image quality compared with FPCT low-dose and both CBCT acquisitions. Flat-panel CT may provide sufficient image quality to serve as a versatile CT alternative for postoperative imaging of internally fixated wrist fractures.

J	Ryu, SM; Park, SG; Kim, JH; Yang, HS; Na, HD; Seo, JS				Ryu, Seung Min; Park, Sam-Guk; Kim, Ji-Hoon; Yang, Han Seok; Na, Ho Dong; Seo, Jae-Sung			Treatment of Modified Mason Type III or IV Radial Head Fracture: Open Reduction and Internal Fixation versus Arthroplasty	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Radial head fracture; radial head repair; radial head anthroplasty	ELBOW FRACTURES; EXCISION; PROSTHESIS; STABILITY; KINEMATICS	Background: The treatment of modified Mason Type III or IV fractures is controversial. Many authors report open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with reconstruction of the radial head, but others advocate radial head arthroplasty (RHA). This study compares the clinical and radiological outcomes of ORIF and RHA uu modified Mason Type III or IV radial head fracture and evaluates correlations between prognostic factors and postoperative clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods: 42 patients with modified Mason Type III or IV radial head fractures who were surgically treated between January 2010 and January 2014 we retrospectively analyzed (20 patients with RHA and 22 patients with ORIF group were selected). Clinically, the patient rated elbow evaluation (PREE), the disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH), and the range of motion (ROM) were measured. Radiologically, plain radiographs and computed tomography scans were taken. Results: The mean MI scores were 13.9 for the RHA group and 13.0 for the ORIF group, and mean DASH scores were 9.5 and 10.7, respectively. The differences were not statistically significant. When comparing ROM, the patients in the RHA group showed greater movement at all measured angles. In multiple regression analysis, age was the only variable significantly associated with both PREE and DASH. Conclusion: Overall, there were no significant differences in clinical outcomes of modified Mason Type III or IV radial head fractures treated with ORIF or RHA. However, a subgroup of younger patients had better clinical outcomes with ORIF treatment. Therefore. ORE should be the first line of treatment, particularly if the reduction is possible.

Analysis of Reoperations after Surgical Treatment of Degenerative Cervical Spine Disorders: A Report on 900 Cases	CENTRAL EUROPEAN NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						degenerative cervical spine; reoperation; fusion; corpectomy	PLATE STABILIZATION; INTERBODY FUSION; DISKECTOMY; CASPAR; DISC; CORPECTOMY; FIXATION; REMOVAL; FAILURE	Surgery on the degenerative cervical spine disorders aims at decompression of the neural structures and restoring the physiological profile of the cervical spine. The aims of internal fixation are to gain primary stability, introduce a bony fusion and to correct the shape of the spine. The present study will give answers to the following questions: 1. What is the overall revision rate following an operative treatment of degenerative cervical disorders using common operative techniques? 2. Is there any influence of the fusion length to the overall revision rate and especially to the decompensation ratio of adjacent segments? 3. What is the rate of revisions due to instrumentation failures? 4. Are there any differences concerning the revision rate between posterior and anterior instrumentation? Material: We reviewed 900 patients, who underwent a cervical spine surgery with an internal fixation between January 1994 and December 2000. Methods: Five different operative techniques were used: type I (mono-and bisegmental inter-somatic decompression and fusion using anterior instrumentation), type II (multisegmental inter-somatic decompression and fusion using anterior instrumentation), type III (multisegmental anterior intersomatic decompression and fusion with posterior instrumentation), type IV (one-level corpectomy with vertebral body replacement and anterior instrumentation) and type V (multi-level corpectomy with vertebral body replacement and posterior instrumentation). The minimum follow up period was 2.2 years (mean 4.2 years). Results: In total, 121 revisions (13.4 %) were recorded. The main indication for revision was implant failure in 5.4 %. Operations type I showed the lowest revision rate (11 %), while type V operations showed the highest revision rate (32 %). Conclusions: The influence of the fusion length on the revision rate was unexpectedly high. Adjacent level decompensation was neither influenced by the length of the fusion nor the performed procedure. Compared to anterior instrumentation, posterior instrumentation showed a tendency for a lower revision rate without statistical significance. However, the posterior procedures showed a high revision rate regarding to wound healing problems.

Materials and Methods: The condyles of 120 porcine mandibles were fractured at a defined location. After anatomic reduction, the fractures were fixed with a Delta plate, a TriLock Delta condyle trauma plate, or 2 4-hole miniplates (40 per group). Each group was subjected to linear loadings in 4 different directions with a universal mechanical testing machine (TIRA Test 2720). Yield load and yield displacement were measured for the 2 Delta plates and the 2 miniplates. Means were derived and compared for statistical significance using the Kruskal-Wallis test with a confidence level of 95% (P < .05). Results: None of the plates broke. In 4 cases using the double miniplate and in 2 cases using the Delta plate, osteosynthesis screw loosening was registered. In lateral-to-medial and anterior-to-posterior directions, the 2 miniplates tolerated the highest loads. From medial to lateral and from posterior to anterior, the TriLock Delta condyle trauma plate resisted the highest loads. However, there was a statistically significant difference among all osteosynthesis systems only for medial-to-lateral loads. Statistical analysis for displacement showed significant differences among all plates in the 4 directions. Conclusions: This biomechanical study indicates that for rigid internal fixation of condylar fractures of the mandible, similar to 2 miniplates, the 2 Delta plates (Delta plate with gliding holes and TriLock Delta plate) fulfill the principles of a functional and stable osteosynthesis. Both are able to resist physiologic strains. The locking plate (TriLock Delta condyle trauma plate) has the advantages of greater primary stability and decreased likelihood of screw loosening.

Materials and methods This was a retrospective cohort study in a single center. The medical records of patients who underwent THA from March 2002 to March 2017 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were THA and a history of open reduction and internal fixation of acetabular fractures. Thirty-seven patients with a mean age of 56.2 years were enrolled. The Harris hip score (HHS), acetabular fracture classification, time interval between acetabular fracture and THA, cause of THA, surgical approach, implant type, complications, radiographic results, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed. Results All patients were followed up for an average of 6.6 years. The mean preoperative HHS of 42.5 had improved to 83.5 at the final follow-up (p < 0.05). There were 29 cases of post-traumatic arthritis, 6 cases of avascular necrosis, and 4 cases of non-union. The average interval from injury to THA was 58 months (range 4-336 months). The re-admission rate was 18.9%. Patients who underwent conversion to THA due to post-traumatic arthritis combined with non-union acetabular fracture developed clinical failure more frequently than patients with post-traumatic arthritis (p = 0.037). At 12 years, 83.4% of patients were free from revision of femoral and acetabular components. Conclusion THA secondary to an operatively treated acetabular fracture provides good symptomatic relief, but shows relatively inferior survival rates, and clinical failure was related to post-traumatic arthritis with acetabular non-union.

Undesirable post-operative healing of the incision is a common complication. In this retrospective study, controllable risk factors of incision complications after closed calcaneal fracture surgery through a lateral L-shaped incision are discussed and the effectiveness of clinical intervention is assessed. Materials and Methods: A review of medical records was conducted of 209 patients (239 calcaneal fractures) surgically treated from June 2005 to October 2012. Univariate analyses were performed of seven controllable factors that might influence complications associated with the surgical incision. Binomial multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine factors of statistical significance. Results: Twenty-one fractures (8.79%) involved surgical incision complications, including 8 (3.35%) cases of wound dehiscence, 7 (2.93%) of flap margin necrosis, 5 (2.09%) of hematoma, and 1 (0.42%) of osteomyelitis. Five factors were statistically significant: The time from injury to surgery, operative duration, post-operative drainage, retraction of skin flap, bone grafting, and patients' smoking habits. The results of multivariate analyses showed that surgeries performed within 7 days after fracture, operative time > 1.5 h, no drainage after surgery, static skin distraction, and patient smoking were risk factors for calcaneal incision complications. The post-operative duration of antibiotics and bone grafting made no significant difference. Conclusion: Complications after calcaneal surgeries may be reduced by postponing the surgery at least 7 days after fracture, shortening the time in surgery, implementing post-operative drainage, retracting skin flaps gently and for as short a time as possible, and prohibiting smoking.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the functional results after low-severity metacarpal and phalangeal fractures treated by miniature plates and screws. Materials and methods We retrospectively reviewed 44 patients of a consecutive series with 56 low-severity metacarpal and/or phalangeal fractures stabilized with miniature plates and screws with a mean follow-up of 24 months to assess objective and subjective outcomes and complications. The objective assessment included measurement of the range of motion ( ROM) of the involved finger, prehension, sensory function and strength. The subjective evaluation assessed the impairment and pain felt by the patient. Results At the final check-up, average total active movement of the involved digit was 256degrees ( range 175degrees - 260degrees), and average score for prehension was 49.3 ( range 30 - 50), with 41 patients with a full score. The Jamar test pointed to a significant reduction in grip strength ( - 5.2%) of the injured hand compared with the other hand. Average subjective impairment score for all the fractures was 15.5 ( range 10 - 16), with 39 patients having a score between 16 and 14 ( no impairment). Fracture reduction was anatomic in 42 fractures (75%), satisfactory in 11 (19.6%) and unsatisfactory in 3 (5.4%). There were no contractures, non-unions, infections or tendon ruptures. Twenty patients (45%) presented with one or more complications in 23 fractures (41.1%). Conclusion These very favourable results suggest that miniature plates and screws are a possible choice in the treatment of these fractures.

ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Osteosynthesis; Ankle fracture; Geriatric; TTC nailing; Ankle ORIF	FRAGILITY FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPERATIVE TREATMENT; OPEN REDUCTION	Introduction Optimal treatment of high-risk ankle fractures in older, comorbid patients is unknown. Results of open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) versus tibiotalocalcaneal (TTC) fusion nailing for the treatment of high-risk geriatric ankle fractures were investigated. Materials and methods Results of ORIF versus TTC fusion nailing were evaluated via retrospective case-control cohort study of 60 patients over age 50 with an open ankle fracture or one with at least 50% talar subluxation and at least 1 high-risk comorbidity: diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral vascular disease, immunosuppression, active smoking, or a BMI > 35. The primary outcome was reoperation rate within 1-year post-surgery. Secondary outcomes include infection, peri-implant fracture, malunion/nonunion, mortality, length of stay, disposition, and hospital acquired complications. Results Mean age was 71 (ORIF) and 68 (TTC). 12/47 (25.5%) ORIF cases were open fractures versus 4/14 (28.6%) with TTC. There were no significant differences between ORIF and TTC in 1-year reoperation rates (17% vs 21.4%), infection rates (12.8% vs 14.3%), or union rates (76.% vs 85.7%), respectively. One TTC patient sustained a peri-implant fracture treated nonoperatively. There were no significant differences in medical risk factors between groups other than a higher rate of DM in the TTC group, 42.6% vs 78.6%, p = 0.02. Incomplete functional outcome data in this challenging patient cohort precluded drawing conclusions. Conclusion ORIF and TTC fusion nailing result in comparable and acceptable reoperation, infection, and union rates in treating high-risk ankle fractures in patients over 50 with at least 1 major comorbidity for increased complications; further study is warranted.

A Triple-Blind Randomized Clinical Trial	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article								Purpose: Hemorrhage is one of the significant factors that cause adverse reactions and complications during trauma management. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of preoperative tranexamic acid (TXA) administration on intraoperative blood loss in mandibular fracture surgeries. Materials and Methods: The authors implemented a triple blinded randomized clinical trial. All healthy young patients who suffered from bilateral displaced mandibular angle and body fractures were included in this study. All operations were performed using open reduction and internal fixation by the same surgical team. The eligible subjects were randomly divided into 2 equal groups. The anesthesiology staff administered the intravenous TXA (20 mg/kg) to the intervention group and 20 mL of intravenous normal saline (0.09%) in the control group, 30 minutes preoperatively. The study outcome variables included intraoperative blood loss and hemoglobin loss. The data were statistically analyzed in SPSS, version 20 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Results: Fifty patients, including 31 males (62%) and 19 females (38%), with the mean age of 28 +/- 5.6 years were studied. The mean blood loss was 360.57 +/- 173.5 mL and 560.9 +/- 248.07 mL in the TXA and control groups, respectively. This difference was statistically significant (P = .008). In addition, the mean drop in hemoglobin value was 0.91 +/- 0.33 mg/dL in the intervention group and 1.44 +/- 0.45 mg/dL in the control group, with a significant difference (P = .001). No adverse effect was observed in the TXA cases. Conclusions: TXA is a safe and effective drug for reducing intraoperative blood loss in patients who underwent mandibular fracture open reduction and internal fixation surgeries.

Therefore, the present study aimed to identify the patients for whom SPECT/CT examination will be most beneficial. Material/Methods: Sixty-five patients with a unilateral femoral neck fracture who underwent SPECT/CT examination of the hip and were treated via closed reduction and internal fixation with three screws were enrolled between January 2009 and March 2011. A decision tree model (C 5.0) was used to identify the factors that best reflect blood supply and to build a flowchart for identifying patients who would benefit from SPECT/CT. Results: Fracture type was most strongly associated with the Fracture/Normal (F/N) ratio, which reflects the blood supply to the fractured femoral head. Age and the time interval from injury to examination were also associated with the F/N ratio. SPECT/CT examination is most beneficial for patients with a displaced fracture, especially if they are over 58 years old and the time interval from injury to examination is less than 10 days. Conclusions: Our results indicate that elderly people with a displaced fracture are most likely to benefit from SPECT/CT examination, which can show the blood supply to the femoral head within a relatively short window of time after the injury.

The modified tension-band technique is widely accepted for internal fixation. The management of comminuted fractures often requires additional K-wire and/or circlage material and wide surgical exposure. Therefore, symptoms and complications related to the stainless steel wire are not uncommon in these cases. We present a new alternative treatment technique for comminuted patellar fractures. Methods: Five comminuted patellar fractures of four patients were treated by circular external fixator (CEF) under ar- throscopic control. The mean patient age was 32.5 (range 24-41) years and mean follow-up was 22 (range 20-28) months. Results: In four cases, union was completed by the sixth week; in the other case, union was completed by the eighth week. The frames were removed after union of the fracture was documented. When the CEF was removed, full knee range of motion was observed full in all patients, and the patients returned to their normal activities of living in a few days. The mean Lysholm score was 94 (range 85-100) after treatment. Conclusions: CEF application under arthroscopic control can help avoid some complications of the traditional treatment methods, particularly in comminuted fractures of the patella. The most important advantage of this technique is to allow active knee motion in the early postoperative period so patients can return to activity of daily living soon after the implant removal. In addition, arthroscopic examination of the knee joint provides an assessment of any other intra-articular lesions. This technique allows healing of the fracture with low morbidity.

Materials and Methods: A total of 17 children with bladder exstrophy underwent surgery. Mean patient age was 27 months. Of the patients 15 had a history of 1 or more failed bladder closures with or without osteotomy. All children underwent bladder closure and complete posterior and anterior urethroplasty with bladder neck wrap. Both ureteral orifices were brought together by the Gil-Vernet antireflux procedure. The pubes were brought together with 3 deeply placed 1 mm polyglactin sutures through the bone and fixed by placing a miniature metal plate with 6 to 7 screws. Patients remained in a frog leg bandage for 1 to 3 weeks. The plate was removed during additional surgery. Median followup was 61 months (range 14 to 71). Results: All children had an uneventful postoperative period without any serious complications, except for skin erosion caused by a screw without bone infection in 1 patient, and miniature plate subluxation following cystoscopy for reinsertion of urethral catheter 3 days after initial surgery in 1. Operating time and hospital stay were significantly lower than in children undergoing osteotomy or Bryant's traction. Overall continence rate was 53.8%. Conclusions: Although the number of patients is low, these results are promising. Pubic bone adaptation with miniature plate fixation without any type of osteotomy or leg traction is safe and less invasive than bilateral osteotomy and postoperative leg traction or plaster.

The aim of the current study was to examine the new ABP's segmental bone transfer capability for the treatment of a segmental bone defect in an animal model. Materials and methods: Five sheep had ABPs attached to 10 of their tibias and bone defects of 15 mm in size were created. The pinion mechanism was moved with a manual screwdriver at a rate of 1mm/day for 15 days starting 3 days postoperatively. The animals were euthanized 3 months postoperatively, and the defect site and the transferred segment were evaluated by radiological and histological examination. Results: The radiological results revealed successful transfers of 14.6 +/- 1.2 mm of bone segment on all tibia defects without any complications. The histological evaluation showed new bone formation in both the extension and the docking sites. No rupture or breakage was observed within the plates. Conclusion: We have presented the potential of a new generation ABP for use in segmental bone transfer in an animal model as well as for future clinical applications.

Material/Methods: Eight-four patients with acute and subacute thoracolumbar fractures who were treated with SSPSF from January 2013 to June 2014 at the Changzhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Changzhou, China) were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into 4 groups: the OPSF with 4 basic screws (OPSF-4) group, the OPSF with 4 basic and 2 additional screws (OPSF-6) group, the PPSF with 4 basic screws (PPSF-4) group, and the PPSF with 4 basic and 2 additional screws (PPSF-6) group. The intraoperative, immediate postoperative, and over 1-year follow-up outcomes were evaluated and compared among these groups. Results: Blood loss in the PPSF-4 group and the PPSF-6 group was significantly less than in the OPSF-4 group and the OPSF-6 group (P<0.05). The OPSF-6 group exhibited significantly higher immediate postoperative correction percentage of anterior column height of fractured vertebra than the other 3 groups (P<0.05), and higher correction of sagittal regional Cobb angle and kyphotic angle of injured vertebra than in the PPSF-4 and -6 groups (P<0.05). In addition, there was no significant difference in the correction loss of percentage of anterior column height, and loss of sagittal Cobb angle and kyphotic angle of fractured vertebrae at final follow-up among the 4 groups (P>0.05). Conclusions: OPSF with 6 screws had an advantage in the correction of injured vertebral height and kyphosis, and PPSF reduced the intraoperative blood loss of patients.

However, general agreement does not exist regarding the optimum design of this fixator type. Therefore, the aim of this article is to reduce the intrinsic Less Invasive Stabilization System complications by clarifying, from a biomechanical point of view, how the number of screws, the screw connection type (unicortical or bicortical), or the structured position of the screws can influence the outcome of the fracture site. These studies include a specific finite element analysis that determines how several biomechanical variables, such as the movement at the fracture site, are influenced by the preconditions of bone healing. The results of this study show that the screw type affects the mechanical stabilization of the femur to a greater extent than the material type of the Less Invasive Stabilization System femoral plates. The most significant differences among all the analyzed configurations are observed in the shear interfragmentary strain between screw types. Values are approximately 50% higher with unicortical screws than with bicortical ones.

Displaced proximal humeral fractures: intramedullary nailing versus conservative treatment	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						conservative treatment; dislocated; intramedullary nailing; proximal humeral fracture	INTERNAL-FIXATION; 4-PART FRACTURES; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; POLARUS NAIL; HEMIARTHROPLASTY; 3-PART; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; SHOULDER; ADULTS	Introduction A variety of different treatment options are available for displaced three- or four-part fractures. In a retrospective cohort study we evaluated the results of intramedullary nailing with the ACE nail and conservative treatment of displaced proximal humeral fractures. Materials and methods Twenty-four patients suffered a neer 4, 5 or 6 proximal humeral fracture who were treated with intramedullary nailing. Sixteen patients received conservative treatment for their Neer 4, 5 or 6 fracture. Results Taking critical remarks in consideration, the results of intramedullary nailing are not very satisfactory compared to the conservative-treated group. However functional results of our operative group are comparable to those from other studies in literature. Conclusion Displaced three- or four-part proximal humeral fractures can be treated by intramedullary nailing. Familiarity with the fracture deformity and experience with the surgical techniques are critical for successful operative treatment outcome. Most complications in the operative treatment group can be avoided; inadequate reduction can lead to wrong insertion place with secondary problems (dislocation and subacromial impingement). Also future improvements in osteosynthesis like angle stable screw fixation (osteoporosis) and minimally invasive device will probably decrease the complication rate.

J	Fang, ZH; Waizy, H; Xie, M; Kan, WS				Fang Zhenhua; Waizy, Hazibullah; Xie Ming; Kan Wusheng			Lateral malleolus hook plate for comminuted Weber A and B fractures: A retrospective study	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Lateral malleolus; distal comminuted lateral malleolus fracture; lateral malleolus hook plate	ANKLE FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; TALAR SHIFT; LAG SCREW	Background: The goal of managing the comminuted fracture of lateral malleolus is to restore length, rotation and alignment which might be more challenging with extensive comminution around the area of the distal tip. The common osteosynthesis techniques such as the one-third tubular plate, tension band wiring, K-wires, screws, or intramedullary nail may be insufficient in cases with a comminuted lateral malleolus. The anatomical hook plate is an alternative implant in such cases. We present our results of the comminuted lateral malleolar fractures (Weber A, B), managed by open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with an anatomical hook plate of lateral malleolus (Konigsee Implant Company, Germany). Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 20 patients of comminuted fracture of distal lateral malleolus between 2008 and 2010. There were 12 males and 8 females, right side was involved in 18 patients and left in 2. The mean age was 51.9 years (range 18-75 years). The fractures were categorized by Denis-Weber classification type A (n=1), B1 (n=1), B2 (n=13) and B3 (n=5). Nineteen cases were of closed injury and one of open injury (Gustilo Anderson type II). These patients underwent ORIF with a lateral malleolus anatomical hook plate. Followup including radiographs and clinical examinations were performed. The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle hindfoot scores were documented at followups. Results: The mean followup was 21.4 months (range 16-27 months). The average AOFAS score was 94.3 (range 78-100) points. A stable anatomic reduction and bony union were obtained in all the cases. The average time was 3.1 months (range 2.5-4 months). Four cases had complications like posttraumatic osteoarthritis, hardware impingement and superficial wound infection. Conclusion: A reasonably good stability can be obtained in distal most comminuted fractures of lateral malleolus with a lateral malleolus anatomical hook plate. We believe this method to be a reasonable treatment option for a distal lateral comminuted malleolar fracture when other common fixations are insufficient to fix the fragments.

Material/Methods: We reviewed the cases of 62 children with ST who were treated in our hospital from January 2010 to December 2014. In this study, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) level, Frankel classification of neurological function, pain visual analog scale (VAS) score, and kyphosis Cobb (k-Cobb) angle were dynamically monitored to evaluate the efficacy of different surgical methods. Complications in the patients were evaluated at 3 time points: before surgery (T1), after surgery (T2), and during final follow-up (T3). The average follow-up was 27.4 months. Twenty-two patients underwent simple anterior debridement alone or combined with internal fixation (Method A), 13 patients underwent posterior debridement alone (Method B), and 27 patients received anteroposterior debridement and bone graft fusion together with internal fixation (Method C). Results: In all 3 groups after surgery, ESR, CRP levels, VAS scores, and k-Cobb angles significantly decreased. However, compared with patients who received Methods B and C, patients who received Method A had a significant rebound in k-Cobb angle and a higher incidence of complications at the T3 time point. The overall reoperation rate during follow-up was 37.10%. Fourteen patients (22.58%) had kyphosis, 2 patients (3.23%) had tuberculosis recurrence combined with kyphosis, and other complications were reported in 5 patients (8.06%). Conclusions: Considering the incidence of complications and level of postoperative biochemical indicators, we concluded that caution should be exercised in using an anterior approach to treat pediatric ST.

This retrospective study from a single center in China aimed to investigate the parameters and risk factors associated with glottic entrance stenosis by evaluating 154 patients with scoliosis who underwent posterior surgical correction, internal fixation, and fusion. Material/Methods: A total of 161 patients diagnosed with scoliosis from 2018 to 2020 were included and grouped by classification, and 7 of them were excluded from the risk factor analysis. All patients underwent posterior surgical correction, internal fixation, and fusion. Basic data, scoliosis-related information, and radiological image were collected. Sagittal and transverse diameter and cross-section area were measured. A new definition of glottic entrance stenosis was proposed based on the traditional formula for prediction of tracheal tuba diameter.Results: The percentage of transverse stenosis in these patients was 35.4%, and the incidence of sagittal stenosis and area stenosis were 9.9% and 12.4% respectively, while 37.9% of scoliosis patients also have at least 1 type of glottic entrance stenosis. Longer course of disease is a proven risk factor for sagittal stenosis (P=0.037). Smaller lumbar lordosis indicates higher risk of transverse stenosis (P=0.024). Wedged vertebrae are a risk factor for area stenosis (P=0.024). Conclusions: This study comprehensively measured glottic entrance parameters in patients with scoliosis, proposed a new definition of glottic entrance stenosis, and found that longer course of disease, smaller lumbar lordosis, and wedged vertebrae were risk factors for sagittal stenosis, transverse stenosis, and area stenosis, respectively.

Treatment of unstable vertebral burst fractures using the same principles like in stable vertebral burst fractures may show less favourable results in terms of fracture reduction, maintenance of reduction and cement leakage. In order to address these shortcomings this study introduces cementless fixation of unstable vertebral burst fractures using internal fixators and expandable intravertebral titanium mesh cages in a one-stage procedure via minimum- invasive techniques. Material and Methods A total of 16 consecutive patients (median age 76 years, range 58-94) with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures and concomitant osteoporosis were treated by an internal fixator inserted via minimum invasive technique one level above and below the fractured vertebra. Fracture reduction was achieved and maintained by transpedicular placement of two titanium mesh cages into the fractured vertebral body during the same procedure. Intra-and postoperative safety of the procedure as well as analysis of reduction quality was analysed by 3D C-arm imaging or CT, respectively. Clinical and radiographic follow-up averaged 10.4 months (range 4.5-24.5). Results Stabilization of the collapsed vertebral body was achieved in all 16 cases without any intraoperative complication. Surgical time averaged 102 +/- 6.6 minutes (71-194). The postoperative kyphotic angle (KA) and Cobb angle revealed significant improvements (KA 13.7 degrees to 7.4 degrees, p<0.001; Cobb 9.6 degrees to 6.0 degrees, p<0.002) with partial loss of reduction at final follow-up (KA 8.3 degrees, Cobb 8.7 degrees). VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) improved from 7.6 to 2.6 (p<0.001). Adjacent fractures were not observed. One minor (malposition of pedicle screw) complication was encountered. Conclusion Cementless fixation of osteoporotic burst fractures revealed substantial pain relief, adequate maintenance of reduction and a low complication rate. Bony healing after unstable osteoporotic burst fractures is possible.

Primary hemiarthroplasty for unstable osteoporotic intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly: A retrospective case series	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Hemiarthroplasty; osteoporotic fractures; unstable intertrochanteric fractures	COMPRESSION HIP-SCREW; TROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; FEMORAL FRACTURES; GAMMA-NAIL; PERITROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; BIOMECHANICAL EVALUATION; PROSTHETIC REPLACEMENT; LEINBACH PROSTHESIS; PLATE FIXATION	Background: The management of unstable osteoporotic intertrochantric fractures in elderly is challenging because of difficult anatomical reduction, poor bone quality, and sometimes a need to protect the fracture from stresses of weight bearing. Internal fixation in these cases usually involves prolonged bed rest or limited ambulation, to prevent implant failure secondary to osteoporosis. This might result in higher chances of complications like pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, pneumonia, and decubitus ulcer. The purpose of this study is to analyze the role of primary hemiarthroplasty in cases of unstable osteoporotic intertrochanteric femur fractures. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 37 cases of primary hemiarthroplasty performed for osteoporotic unstable intertrochanteric fractures (AO/OTA type 31-A2.2 and 31-A2.3 and Evans type III or IV fractures). There were 27 females and 10 males with a mean age of 77.1 years (range, 62-89 years). Results: Two patients died due to unrelated cause (myocardial infarction) within 6 months of surgery and remaining 35 patients were followed up to an average of 24.5 months (range, 18-39 months). The average surgery time was 71 min (range, 55-88 min) with an average intraoperative blood loss of 350 ml (range, 175-500 ml). Six patients needed blood transfusion postoperatively. The patients walked on an average 3.2 days after surgery (range, 2-8 days). One patient had superficial skin infection and one had bed sore with no other significant postoperative complications. One patient of Alzheimer's disease refused to walk and had a poor result. A total of 32 out of 35 patients (91%) had excellent to fair functional results and 2 had poor result with respect to the Harris hip score (mean 84.8+/-9.72, range 58-97). One patient who had neurological comorbidity refused to walk post operatively and was labeled as failed result. Conclusion: Hemiarthroplasty for unstable osteoporotic intertrochanteric fractures in elderly results in early ambulation and good functional results although further prospective randomized trials are required before reaching to conclusion.

When responsible for neurological impairment, these rare lesions require a decompression procedure. We present the results of a new option to treat these lesions: an open balloon kyphoplasty associated with a short-segment posterior internal fixation. Materials and methods: Twelve patients, aged a mean 72.3 years, were included in this prospective series; all of them presented osteoporotic burst fractures located between T11 and L2 associated with neurological impairment. The surgical procedure first consisted of a laminectomy, for decompression, followed by an open balloon kyphoplasty. A short-segment posterior internal fixation was subsequently put into place when the local kyphosis was considered severe. A CAT scan study evaluated local vertebral body's height restoration using two pre- and postoperative radiological indices. Results: All of the patients in the series were followed up for a mean 14 months. Local kyphosis improved a mean 10.8 (p < 0.001). Vertebral body height was also substantially restored, with a mean gain of 26% according to the anterior height/adjacent height ratio and 28% according to the Beck Index (p < 0.001). Two cases of cement leakage were recorded, with no adverse clinical side effect. Complete neurological recovery was observed in 10 patients; two retained a minimal neurological deficit but kept a walking capacity. Discussion: The results presented in this study confirm the data reported in the literature in terms of local kyphosis correction and vertebral body height restoration. The combination of this technique with laminectomy plus osteosynthesis allowed us to effectively treat burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction and led to stable results 1 year after surgery. This can be advantageous in a population often carrying multiple co-morbidities. With a single operation, we can achieve neurological decompression and spinal column stability in a minimally invasive way; this avoids more substantial surgery in these fragile patients.

However, valid epidemiologic population-based data, including differentiation of treatment modalities, are lacking. Materials and methods Using the ICD codes and associated OPS codes for PHF, a retrospective analysis of 2007-2016 Federal Statistical Office of Germany data was performed. Data were evaluated for total incidence of PHF as well as total use, annual utilization rates, age, and sex distributions of all associated surgical procedures. Simple linear regressions were performed to evaluate trends in treatment modalities. Results There were 642,556 cases of PHF. During the study period, incidence changed substantially from 65.2 to 74.2 per 100,000 inhabitants with a significant rise in elderly (> 70 years) patients (P < 0.001). The number of surgical procedures increased by 39%, with locking plate fixation being the most common procedure (48.3%), followed by intramedullary nailing (IMN) (20.0%), hemiarthroplasty (HA) (7.5%), K-wire fixation (6.4%), and reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) (5.6%). The utilization rate increased for locking plates, K-wires, and RSA and decreased for HA and IMN. Particularly, the utilization of RSA exhibited a > eightfold increase. Significant linear correlation of procedure and time were found for all surgical treatments. Conclusions During this period, the number of inpatient PHFs, especially in the elderly, increased. Although locking plate fixation remained the most common treatment method, RSA had the greatest proportional increase over time, supporting its growing popularity in the light of the current scientific evidence. This incline was offset by a corresponding decrease in HA and IMN, which may be related to a growing knowledge of their application limitations.

As a model organism, the mouse has already been widely used in bone-related research. Large diaphyseal bone defect models in mice, however, are sparse and often use bone fixation which fills the bone marrow cavity and does not provide optimal mechanical stability. The objectives of the current study were to develop a critical-size, segmental, femoral defect in nude mice. A 3.5-mm mid-diaphyseal femoral ostectomy (approximately 25% of the femur length) was performed using a dedicated jig, and was stabilized with an anterior located locking plate and 4 locking screws. The bone defect was subsequently either left empty or filled with a bone substitute (syngenic bone graft or coralline scaffold). Bone healing was monitored noninvasively using radiography and in vivo micro-computed-tomography and was subsequently assessed by ex vivo micro-computed-tomography and undecalcified histology after animal sacrifice, 10 weeks postoperatively. The recovery of all mice was excellent, a full-weight-bearing was observed within one day following the surgical procedure. Furthermore, stable bone fixation and consistent fixation of the implanted materials were achieved in all animals tested throughout the study. When the bone defects were left empty, non-union was consistently obtained. In contrast, when the bone defects were filled with syngenic bone grafts, bone union was always observed. When the bone defects were filled with coralline scaffolds, newly-formed bone was observed in the interface between bone resection edges and the scaffold, as well as within a short distance within the scaffold.

Total Hip Arthroplasty After Operatively Treated Acetabular Fracture A Concise Follow-up, at a Mean of Twenty Years, of a Previous Report	JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME			English	Article							POSTTRAUMATIC ARTHRITIS; RECONSTRUCTION; COMPONENTS; REDUCTION	Acetabular fractures increase the risk of posttraumatic arthritis and thus the risk of total hip arthroplasty (THA). We previously presented the ten-year results of THA performed for posttraumatic arthritis after an acetabular fracture; we now present the twenty-year outcomes. The original publication included sixty-six patients who underwent THA between 1970 and 1993 for posttraumatic arthritis after open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of an acetabular fracture. Clinical outcomes, implant survivorship, radiographic results, and complications were evaluated. A total of thirty-six patients had died. The mean Harris hip score was 80 at the latest follow-up. Nineteen acetabular and/or femoral components had been revised: eleven for aseptic loosening, seven for osteolysis, and one for instability. Twenty-year survivorship of the acetabular component was 71% free from revision for aseptic loosening and 57% free from revision for any reason. THA after ORIF of an acetabular fracture was associated with fair implant survivorship at twenty years after surgery. It is possible that newer implants with improved fixation surfaces and bearing materials may enhance long-term results, as the most common reasons for failure at twenty years were aseptic loosening and osteolysis.

Ideal method is still controversial with risk of unsatisfactory results if not treated properly. Many different techniques of internal and external fixation are used. This study compares the clinical results in single locked plating versus dual plating (DP) using two incision approaches. Our hypothesis was that DP leads to less collapse and change in alignment at final followup compared with single plating. Materials and Methods: 61 cases of Type C tibial plateau fractures operated between January 2007 and June 2011 were included in this prospective study. All cases were operated either by single lateral locked plate by anterolateral approach or double plating through double incision. All cases were followed for a minimum of 24 months radiologically and clinically. The statistical analysis was performed using software SPSS 10.0 to analyze the data. Results: Twenty nine patients in a single lateral locked plate and 32 patients in a double plating group were followed for minimum 2 years. All fractures healed, however there was a significant incidence of malalignment in the single lateral plating group. Though there was a significant increase in soft tissue issues with the double plating group; however, there was only 3.12% incidence of deep infection. There was no significant difference in Hospital for special surgery score at 2 years followup. Conclusion: Double plating through two incisions resulted in a better limb alignment and joint reduction with an acceptable soft tissue complication rate.

To this aim, data from patients with implant staphylococcal infections (1998-2006) treated with debridement and implant retention were retrospectively reviewed. Infections were defined by staphylococci isolation (two or more consecutive debridement or three sinus tract discharge samples) along with clinical criteria. Patients received oral levofloxacin plus rifampicin for >= 6 weeks after the resolution of signs/symptoms and C-reactive protein normalisation. Failure was defined as lack of response or recurrence of signs/symptoms and/or sinus tract bacterial isolation during therapy or follow-up and/or implant removal. Twenty-five patients (53.2+/-20.8 years; 48% males) were included, 12 with spinal infections and 13 with limb implant infections. Diagnosis was performed from debridement material (72%) and sinus tract discharge (28%) (11 Staphylococcus aureus and 14 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS)). Time from surgery to symptom onset was higher in CoNS infections compared with S. aureus infections (21.6+/-9.3 days vs. 12.6+/-5.2 days; P=0.007). Seven patients (28%) were failures, with no differences between cured patients with respect to age, sex, infection site, time from surgery to symptom onset, sinus tract diagnosis and aetiology. Longer symptom duration prior to attendance was observed in failures (5.7+/-6.2 months vs. 1.4+/-10.6 months; P=0.04). Levofloxacin plus rifampicin showed efficacy in implant infections, which was higher for short duration of symptoms. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. and the International Society of Chemotherapy.

The reconstruction of jaw defects has been improved with the free flap technique and sophisticated microvascular techniques. A deep circumflex iliac artery (DCIA) flap provides a large amount of bone for the reconstruction of the mandible. However, various complications and side effects, such as abnormal hip contour, hernia, severe bleeding tendency, gait disturbance, and hypoesthesia, can occur. Iliac bone fracture is not a common complication after DCIA flap harvesting, because the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) can include the harvested flap. If an iliac avulsion fracture occurs, various treatment options exist. If severe dislocation of the bone fragment exists, open reduction and internal fixation are required. At this time, orthopedic implants composed of various materials can be used. Among these, when using a 3D-fabricated implant using a Ti6Al4V alloy, the accuracy of the size and shape is excellent, and it can have mechanical-biocompatible advantages. In this study, we report cases of iliac bone fracture after reconstruction of the jaw with a DCIA flap and the treatment modality using a 3D-printed, patient-specific titanium implant.

Total hip arthroplasty is used to salvage cases of non union or secondary arthritis in these fractures. However, this option may not be available or may be difficult to achieve when infection has superseded the site of nonunion. The objective of this prospective study was to assess if a staged protocol of treatment yields good results in these difficult cases. Materials and methods Twenty-seven consecutive patients who had deep hip infection with failed treatment of hip fractures (intracapsular in 16 cases and extracapsular in 11) were treated between June 2007 and September 2011. Twenty-six completed the planned two-stage hip arthroplasty and one case was lost after the first stage. The average age of the patients was 48.9 years (range 26-74 years) with an average follow up period of 44 months (30-72 months). Analysis was done using the paired t test where P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results Infection was controlled in all cases that completed the treatment protocol with no recurrence in all cases at the latest follow up. The Harris hip score of the patients improved significantly from 29 preoperatively to 85 at the latest follow up (P < 0.0001). Two patients had hip dislocation with displacement of the trochanteric fragment while three other patients had fibrous union of the trochanter. Conclusions Staged Arthroplasty procedure to salvage infected non union of hip fractures is successful in eradicating infection and regaining hip function.

The effect of glycidyl methacrylate/Joncryl on mechanical properties of poly(lactic acid)/hydroxyapatite was investigated through flexural strength. Cell proliferation and differentiation of osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells cultured on the composite samples were determined by Alamar Blue assay and alkaline phosphatase expression, respectively. Result shows that flexural strength tends to decrease, as glycidyl methacrylate content increases except for 1 wt.% glycidyl methacrylate. With an addition of dicumyl peroxide, the flexural strength shows an improvement than that of without dicumyl peroxide probably due to the chemical bonding of the hydroxyapatite and poly(lactic acid) as revealed by FTIR and NMR, whereas the composite with 5 wt.% Joncryl shows the best result, as the flexural strength increases getting close to pure poly(lactic acid). The significant morphology change could be seen in composite with Joncryl where the uniform agglomeration of hydroxyapatite particles oriented in poly(lactic acid) matrix. Addition of the epoxy functional compatibilizers at suitable percentages could also have benefits to cellular attachment, proliferation, differentiation and mineralization. So that, this poly(lactic acid)/hydroxyapatite composite could be a promising material to be used as internal bone fixation devices such as screws, pins and plates.

The collected data included signalment, weight, time from lameness to surgery, reported trauma, affected side, concomitant orthopaedic injuries, radiographs, osteoarthritis, femoral neck osteolysis, proximal femoral epiphysis to femoral neck ratio, fracture reduction, implants, complications and clinical evaluation results. An owner questionnaire was used for long-term follow-up.ResultsNineteen cats with a total of 21 fractures met the inclusion criteria. Fifteen of the 19 cats showed no signs of lameness at the 1-month follow-up. Major and catastrophic complications occurred in 9.5% and 23.8% of the fractures, respectively. All catastrophic complications occurred in fractures with a high preoperative osteolysis grade (2 or 3).Clinical SignificanceIn our study, transcervical pinning was found to be a reliable fixation method for the treatment of femoral capital physeal fractures in cats with minimal preoperative femoral neck osteolysis. High rates of implant failure with loss of fracture reduction were observed in cats with high-grade preoperative osteolysis.	[De Vreught, L.; Fontenay, R.; Berthelot, P.

Materials and Methods: This study included a total of 15 patients of thoracolumbar dislocation. All patients underwent posterior thoracolumbar open reduction and fixation using this technique. Preoperative x-ray, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging were used to evaluate the dislocation. The American Spinal Injury Association grade of spinal cord injury before and afer the operation were record. All patients were followed up for 2 years, and x-ray, CT were used to observe postoperative reduction and fusion. Results: Postoperative x-ray and CT images of all patients indicated good recovery of the spinal sequence, and no neurological deterioration or surgically related complications occurred. All patients were followed up for 2 years, no patients were lost to follow-up. During the follow-up period, x-ray and CT images showed no complications related to internal fixation such as fracture and loosening of screws and rods were found. Conclusion: A anchoring technique using long bent rods is a safe, simple, accurate, and easy to replicate and implement method, which can be applied in the surgical treatment for thoracolumbar dislocation.

This complex lesion requires an accurate reduction and surgical fixation for a better outcome. Different techniques have been described, however no standard protocol have been proposed. Purpose of this retrospective study, is to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcome with posterior cannulated self-tapping headless screws followed by an early-active-motion protocol and to outline the surgical tips and tricks for different fracture patterns. Materials and methods From 2013 to 2019, a consecutive series of 24 patients with coronal shear fracture undergoing ORIF were included in the study. Fractures were classified according to Dubberley's classification. Cannulated self-tapping headless screws were used to fix the fragments. When necessary, additional cannulated half-threaded screws on the lateral edge of the humerus were used, as well as bone chips and fibrin sealant on severe comminution. All patients underwent an assisted early-active-motion rehabilitation protocol. Mean follow-up was 30 months; patients underwent standard X-rays and clinical outcome assessment with range of motion, Broberg and Morrey score and MEPI score. Results Surgical fixation with headless screw guaranteed complete healing of all shear fractures examined, no loss of reduction were reported. ROM assessment showed good results with an average arc of 113.1 degrees. Excellent to good Broberg-Morrey and MEPI score were reported. No cases of avascular necrosis nor post-traumatic osteoarthritis resulted in our series. Complications occurred in 16.6% of the patients. Conclusion Coronal shear fracture represents a challenging injury to treat. Anatomical reduction and the use of cannulated self-tapping headless screws from posterior provide a stable fixation, high union rates and good elbow function, with a low cartilage damage and risks of necrosis over 2 years of follow-up.

The goal of this retrospective, observational, case series study was to evaluate the medium-long-term clinical and radiographic results of the three most common surgical osteosynthesis techniques used for the treatment of articular tibial pilon fractures: ORIF, MIPO, and EF. Materials and Methods. A consecutive series of patients with articular pilon fractures who underwent surgery at our institution were enrolled in this study. Fractures were classified according to the Muller AO classification system. Overall outcomes took the following into account: radiographic quality of reduction, evaluated using Ovadia and Beals' criteria; clinical assessment, evaluated using the AOFAS questionnaire; and general health, evaluated with the SF36-v2 Health Survey. Results. A total of 94 articular pilon fractures (34 type 43-B and 60 43-C) were evaluated with a mean follow-up of 56.34 months (range 33-101). The techniques used were ORIF, MIPO, and EF in 63 (67%), 17 (18.9%), and 14 cases (14.1%), respectively. According to Ovadia and Beals' criteria, good, fair, and poor results were reported in 61 (64.89%), 26 (27.66%), and 7 (7.45%) cases, respectively. The mean AOFAS score was 82.41 for MIPO, 79.83 for ORIF, and 50.57 for EF, respectively. Thirty-nine patients (41.49%) presented early and/or late complications. Conclusion. Satisfactory outcomes using the three different techniques were reported. In particular, the radiographic outcomes were inversely proportional to the fracture comminutions and statistically different between internal and external osteosynthesis, but comparable between ORIF and MIPO techniques. On the other hand, the clinical outcomes were closely related to the soft tissue conditions and the anatomical reconstruction of the joint.

At present, radial head resection, open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), and prosthetic replacement are three common treatment methods for these fractures. The clinical efficacy and postoperative complications are controversial, which makes it difficult for physicians to determine the most appropriate regimen. Herein, this present prospective, non-randomized, parallel-controlled study was conducted to compare the therapeutic effects and identify the most effective treatment method for Mason type III radial head fracture. Materials and Methods: We assessed patients with Mason type III radial head fracture treated with resection, prosthetic replacement, and ORIF to compare preoperative and postoperative pain condition, elbow joint function, curative effect, and complication rate. A visual analog scale was used to score pain. The elbow joint function was observed using the Broberg-Morrey elbow joint score. Results: No significant differences were found in patient demographics among the resection, prosthetic replacement, and ORIF groups. The prosthetic replacement and ORIF procedures were more complex and had higher technical requirements. Prosthetic replacement and ORIF enabled higher elbow joint scores and lower pain scores than resection. Excellent and good ratings were highest and complication rates were lowest in the prosthetic replacement group, followed by the ORIF group. Conclusion: Our results showed that prosthetic replacement is more effective than ORIF and radial head resection in relieving pain, functional recovery and reducing complications in the treatment of Mason type III radial head fractures.

A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial of a Bioresorbable Calcium Phosphate Paste (α-BSM) in Treatment of Displaced Intra-Articular Calcaneal Fractures	JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	21st Annual Meeting of the Orthopaedic-Trauma-Association	2005	Ottawa, CANADA	Orthopaed Trauma Assoc		Calcaneus; Fracture; Bone graft substitute; Calcium phosphate cement	DISTAL RADIAL FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; NONOPERATIVE TREATMENT; OPERATIVE TREATMENT; CEMENT COMPOSITES; BONE-GRAFT; NORIAN SRS; OS CALCIS; AUGMENTATION	Background: Displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures are devastating injuries and pose a therapeutic challenge. The purpose of this study was to determine whether open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) plus an injectable bioresorbable calcium phosphate paste (alpha-BSM [bone substitute material]) is superior to ORIF alone in the treatment of calcaneal bone voids encountered after operative treatment of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures. Methods: We prospectively randomized 47 patients with 52 closed displaced intra-articular fractures necessitating operative fixation to receive ORIF alone (n = 28) or ORIF plus alpha-BSM (n = 24). The maintenance of Bbhler's angle was evaluated at follow-up visits for more than I year. Secondary outcome measures included the SF-36 and lower extremity measure every 6 months, and the Oral Analog Scale (OAS) score at 2 years. Results: There was no difference between the groups in the degree of collapse of Bohler's angle at 6 weeks and 3 months when compared with initial postoperative values. However, at 6 months, the mean collapse of the a-BSM and ORIF group was 5.6 degree (SD, 4.5 degree) and ORIF alone was 9.1 degree (SD, 5.8 degree), which was statistically significant (P = 0.03). Final radiographic evaluation after 1 year revealed a Bohler's angle loss of 6.2 degree (SD 5.9 degree) and 10.4 degree (SD 7.1 degree) in a-BSM and ORIF and ORIF alone groups, respectively, (p = 0.05). There was no difference between the two groups in regards to secondary outcome measures of general health, limb specific function, and pain past 2 years. Conclusion: These results support the use of an injectable, in situ hardening calcium phosphate paste to fill the bone void after a displaced intra-articular calcaneal fracture. There was no impact on general health, limb specific function, and pain past 2 years and no associated complications with a-BSM use, supporting it safety as an augment to ORIF.

Angular stable plate osteosynthesis enables anatomic reduction, but carries the risk of soft-tissue traumatisation and consecutive humeral head necrosis. The present study compares the clinical and radiological outcome of patients with dislocated two-part fractures of the proximal humerus, who were treated with either Zifko nails or angular stable plate fixation. Material and methods: A matched-pair analysis was performed and patient groups were matched according to age (+/- 3 years), sex and fracture type. As many as 11 pairs of patients with a minimum follow-up of 3 years were formed and investigated radiographically and clinically using the Constant score (CS) and the visual analogue scale (VAS) for the patients' satisfaction. Results: At the time of follow-up, the absolute CS was 83 points in the PHP group and 78 points in the Zifko group (n.s.). Neither in the age and gender-corrected CS was found a significant difference between the study groups (PHP 104 +/- 29, Zifko 95 +/- 17, n.s.) nor in terms of subjective patient satisfaction (PHP 6.54; Zifko 7.8, n.s.). The complication rate was also comparable in both groups. Conclusion: In conclusion, Zifko nailing represents a cost-effective minimally invasive surgical method with a complication rate and clinical outcome comparable to that after angular stable osteosynthesis by angular stable plate fixation in the treatment of two-part fractures of the proximal humerus.

The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics and management of mandibular fractures caused by falls. Material and methods One hundred thirty-nine patients with 185 mandible fractures caused by falls were included in this retrospective study. The patients were grouped according to age, gender, fitness level (as classified by the American Society of Anesthesiology physical status classification), the month of the accident, sites of fractures and treatment methods. Results Most adult and fit patients were treated with open reduction and internal fixation, except for intracapsular condyle fractures. Conservative management was chosen for paediatric patients and in all cases deemed at high risk for lengthy procedures under general anaesthesia (physical status III according to the American Society of Anesthesiology). Young patients were mainly males, whereas geriatric patients were mainly females. In cases of single-site fracture, condylar fractures were the most prevalent. In cases with multiple sites, the association of condyle and symphysis fractures was the most frequent. Conclusions The results show an increasing trend in geriatric condyle fractures, especially in females. The epidemiology of fall-related mandibular fractures is subject to the influence of seasonal, historical, cultural and demographic factors.

Most scapular fractures are caused by high-impact blunt injuries, often as the result of motor vehicle accidents, fall from height, etc. In 80% to 90% of cases, scapula fractures are associated with multiple injuries (clavicle fracture, rib fractures, humeral fracture, pulmonary injury, brachial plexus injury). Case report. We presented scapular fracture in a 27-years-old male who had sustained a work-related injury when a ground soil brick machine pressed him. Fracture line was identified on radiotherapy and computed tomography scan from the distal scapular angle enclosing scapular neck. The whole lateral part of the scapula was dislocated laterally from the scapular body. Scapular fracture was treated operatively. The posterior approach was used for reposition, while for fixation after reposition we used two Blunt clamps. We presented functional outcome 22 years after the injury and the surgical treatment. The patient can perform all physical activities, still works, and there is no need to remove the ostheosynthedc material as it causes no discomfort nor problems. The strength of the shoulder muscles is estimated as physician as the grade 5. Conclusion. Displaced intra-articular fractures of the scapula should be treated operatively, with open reduction and internal fixation.

Traditional methods have a variety of intrinsic defaults and cannot successfully manage the requirements of young patients. Benefiting from our ana-tomic research, we explored a new method of external fixa-tion for this specific trauma and evaluated its feasibility and clinical outcomes. Material and methods - Twenty-three young multiple-trauma patients with PFF were included in this study. Surgical treatment was applied using an external fixator via the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS). Electronic patient records, surgical characteristics, clinical outcomes, and complications were reviewed for each patient. Results - The mean surgical time was 30.3 +/- 7.3 min. The mean blood loss was 25.3 +/- 10.8 mL. No iatrogenic nerve palsy, pin tract infection, failure of external fixa-tion, or bedsores were observed. The postoperative visual analog scale score was significantly lower than the pre-operative score (P < 0.01). The mean fracture reduction rate of the femur was 58.1 +/- 17.0%, and the mean degree of reduction was 13.5 +/- 6.9 degrees. The mean external fixation time was 7.6 +/- 4.0 days and intramedullary nailing was performed. The mean hospital, follow-up, and healing times were 28.7 +/- 8.7 days, 23.5 +/- 7.9 months, and 22.8 +/- 5.7 weeks, respectively. The Harris Hip Score indicated excellent or good results in 20 patients. Conclusion - Collectively, the results of this study revealed that external fixation via the AIIS is a safe, rapid, and effective method for acute treatment of PFF in young patients.

Traditional thoracoabdominal surgery in this segment risks trauma and complications. This study analyzed the surgical efficacy of the subdiaphragmatic extraperitoneal approach in the treatment of 11-2 spinal tuberculosis. Material/Methods: Retrospective analysis of 67 patients with 11-2 vertebral tuberculosis who underwent posterior internal fixation was performed: 35 patients underwent the subdiaphragmatic extraperitoneal approach (group A) and 32 underwent the thoracoabdominal approach (group B). Operation time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative hospital stay, postoperative nerve function recovery, deformity correction, bone graft fusion, lesion healing, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and complications were observed. Results: In group A and group B, intraoperative blood loss was 712.00 +/- 64.66 mL and 1104.38 +/- 131.34 ml; average operation time was 3.1E40.67 h and 5.1E41.07 h; and postoperative hospital stay was 9.60 +/- 2.64 days and 13.69 +/- 3.87 days, respectively. At 6 months and 5 years after surgery, neurological function, visual analog scale score, and Cobb angle of all patients were significantly improved compared with those before surgery; ESR and CRP decreased to normal levels; lesions completely cured; and all patients had good bone graft fusion. Pulmonary complications occurred in 2 patients in group A and in 14 patients in group B. Conclusions: The efficacy of subdiaphragmatic extraperitoneal approach was similar to that of the thoracoabdominal approach for 11-2 spinal tuberculosis, but the former has the advantages of less surgical trauma, shorter operation time, less intraoperative bleeding, and fewer postoperative pulmonary complications.

Background FICS is a recently developed modality that consists in inserting screws, under imaging guidance, into bone through a minimal skin incision. FICS recently showed good efficacy for the palliation or prevention of pathologic fractures of the pelvic ring and femoral neck. Materials and methods In this single-center retrospective study, we reviewed all consecutive cancer patients treated with percutaneous FICS under ENS-assisted CT guidance for the prevention or palliation of pelvic or femoral neck fractures. The primary endpoint was technical success. Secondary endpoints were screw placement accuracy (defined by proximal deviation p, distal deviation d, and angle deviation theta), radiation dose exposure, number of CT acquisitions, duration of procedures, and complications. Results Mean duration of FICS procedures was 111 +/- 51 min. Mean post-procedure hospitalization length was 2.1 days. Technical success was achieved in 48 cases (96%) with a total of 76 screws inserted. Mean distance p, mean distance d, and mean angle theta were respectively 8.0 +/- 4.5 mm, 7.5 +/- 4.4 mm, and 5.4 +/- 2 degrees. Angle theta accuracy was higher for screws with a craniocaudal angulation of less than 20 degrees (4.4 degrees vs 6.4 degrees, p = 0.02). The mean number of CT acquisitions during procedures was 6.4 +/- 3.0. The mean dose length product was 1524 +/- 953 mGy cm and the mean dose area product was 12 +/- 8 Gy cm(2). Five complications occurred in 4 patients. Conclusion CT guidance assisted by ENS is an effective approach for percutaneous FICS.

There is scant evidence, however, indicating which approach is more suitable. We compared clinical and radiological outcomes of patients with AO 2R3 C3 fractures surgically treated with one of these approaches. Materials and methods From January 2015 to November 2018, 72 surgically treated patients with AO 2R3 C3 fractures were radiologically (12 months) and clinically (mean 26 months) evaluated. Forty-one patients underwent ORIF using the palmar approach (Group 1), and the dorsal approach was used in 31 patients (Group 2). Radiological parameters were measured using the AO scoring system immediately following surgery and 12 months later. Clinical assessments included the range of motion, PRWE and DASH scores. Results At the immediate postoperative assessment, the median AO score was 5.5 (IQR 2-9.5, range 0-30.5) for Group 1 and 8 (IQR 5-15, range 0-27) for Group 2, and 12-month follow-up results were 4.5 (IQR 1.5-10, range 0-41) and 6.5 (IQR 5-11, range 0-29.5), respectively. Group 1 had more favorable results for the flexion, extension, radial abduction, PRWE and DASH parameters. The plate removal and reoperation rates were higher in Group 2. Discussion When treating complex intraarticular distal radius fractures, we found the palmar approach was more advantageous for this fracture pattern. Nevertheless, a dorsal approach may still be suitable for intraarticular comminuted distal radius fractures with dorsally displaced joint fragments.

Materials and Methods Medical records and radiographs of closed radial and ulnar fractures treated using internal fixation with a 1.5- or 2.0-mm titanium locking plate without antibiotic prophylaxis were collected prospectively. Patients were clinically followed up until radiographical fracture healing was complete. Results Thirty-two fractures in small breed dogs and cats with an average bodyweight of 3.9 kg met the inclusion criteria. The follow-up time radiographically and clinically was 4-35 weeks. All fractures showed radiographical fracture union, and all patients had a good clinical outcome. The superficial infection rate in this case series was 0%; the deep infection rate involving the implant/bone was 3.1%. Clinical Significance The novel 1.5- and 2.0-mm titanium locking plate system was successfully used to treat simple closed radial and ulnar fractures in small breed dogs and cats without peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis, resulting in good clinical outcome and a low infection rate.

J	Demirbas, A				Demirbas, Ayhan			Concept of energy conversion in engineering education	ENERGY EDUCATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PART B-SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						Energy conversion; Engineering education; Energy conservation; Photosynthesis	ALGAE	The law of conservation of energy states that the total amount of energy in an isolated system remains constant. A consequence of this law is that energy cannot be created nor destroyed. Changes in energy in systems can only be accomplished by adding or subtracting energy from them, as energy is a quantity which is conserved. Energy in a system may be transformed so that it resides in a different state. Energy in many states may be used to do many varieties of physical work. Energy may be used in natural processes or machines, or else to provide some service to society, such as heat, light, or motion. Energy may be transformed so that it may be used by other natural processes or machines, or else to provide some service to society. For example, an internal combustion engine converts the potential chemical energy in gasoline and oxygen into the propulsive energy that moves a vehicle. A solar cell converts solar radiation into electrical energy that can then be used to light a bulb or power a computer. All biomass is produced by green plants converting sunlight into plant material through photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is a carbon fixation reaction by reduction of carbon dioxide. The fixation or reduction of carbon dioxide is a light-independent process.

Multiple intramedullary nailing of proximal phalangeal fractures of hand	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Hand; multiple intramedullary nailing; proximal phalangeal fractures	PLATE FIXATION; INTERNAL-FIXATION; CLOSED REDUCTION; METACARPAL; SCREWS; COMPLICATIONS; SHAFT	Background: Proximal phalangeal fractures are commonly encountered fractures in the hand. Majority of them are stable and can be treated by non-operative means. However, unstable fractures i.e. those with shortening, displacement, angulation, rotational deformity or segmental fractures need surgical intervention. This prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the functional outcome after surgical stabilization of these fractures with joint-sparing multiple intramedullary nailing technique. Materials and Methods: Thirty-five patients with 35 isolated unstable proximal phalangeal shaft fractures of hand were managed by surgical stabilization with multiple intramedullary nailing technique. Fractures of the thumb were excluded. All the patients were followed up for a minimum of six months. They were assessed radiologically and clinically. The clinical evaluation was based on two criteria. 1. total active range of motion for digital functional assessment as suggested by the American Society for Surgery of Hand and 2. grip strength. Results: All the patients showed radiological union at six weeks. The overall results were excellent in all the patients. Adventitious bursitis was observed at the point of insertion of nails in one patient. Conclusion: Joint-sparing multiple intramedullary nailing of unstable proximal phalangeal fractures of hand provides satisfactory results with good functional outcome and fewer complications.

Predictive factors for successful vessel-intact laparoscopic orchiopexy for intra-abdominal testes	JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC UROLOGY			English	Article						Intra-abdominal testis; Laparoscopic orchiopexy	MANAGEMENT	Objective: To identify the predictive factors for successful vessel-intact laparoscopic orchiopexy (VILO) for nonpalpable intra-abdominal testes (NPIT). Materials and methods: 25 boys with 28 NPITs within 2 cm of the internal ring underwent VILO. They were divided into two groups based upon outcome, for statistical comparison. Group A (successful VILO): patients with testes pexed in scrotum during surgery, and maintained viability and scrotal position of testes at 3-month & 6-month postoperative follow up. Group B: failed VILO. Results: Intrascrotal fixation at VILO was achievable for 17/28 NPITs. Postoperative follow up and final outcome data were available for 25/28 NPITs, of which 14 were successful (A) while 11 had failed VILO (B). The mean age of patients in group A differed significantly from that of patients in group B (4.16 years versus 6.64 years; p = 0.035). The mean testis-to-internal ring distance was 0.50 cm for group A and 1.05 cm for group B, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.141). There was statistically a highly significant difference (p = 0.002) with respect to the mean internal ring-to-midscrotum distances in groups A and B: 5.56 cm and 7.05 cm, respectively. A scatter-plot of age or height against internal ring-to-midscrotum distance showed a fairly linear relationship. Conclusions: Age or height of the patient at surgery is an independent factor predicting the success of VILO for intra-abdominal testis. The internal ring-to-midscrotum distance increases with age/height, resulting in increased testis-to-midscrotum distance and higher failure rate of VILO in older children.

IMPV is still preferable for treating valgus-impacted four-part fractures in which K-wires have the advantage of working as an internal fixation material as well as a tool in fracture reduction. Methods: Three 2.4-mm K-wires formed into the desired shape are used as the intramedullary pins and a 3.0- to 3.2-mm upwardly angled hole for each wire is opened in the deltoid "V." After the tips of two wires are introduced into the lateral aspect of the head, the valgus deformity of the head is gradually corrected by alternately tapping the two wires under fluoroscopy. When the head and metaphysis are strongly compressed together, open reduction is attempted. If required, the tuberosity fragments are surgically reduced and stabilized. We performed IMPV on one C2.1 fracture and nine C2.2 fractures with 1 year or more follow-up. Results: No nonunion was observed, but avascular head necrosis with collapse was observed in two C2.2 fractures, of which constant score ratios to the normal side were 55% and 64%, respectively. The constant score ratios of the other eight patients were 92% +/- 8% (70-96%). Conclusions: IMPV is considered to be a preferable reducing and stabilizing method for valgus-impacted four-part fractures regardless of patient age. Additionally beneficial is being able to use the intramedullary pins as a tool for bone fragment reduction.

Materials and Methods: This study was based on a multicenter systematic database that allowed the recording of data from all patients with mandibular angle fractures between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2017. The following data were recorded: gender, age, etiology, side of angle fracture, associated mandibular fractures, presence of third molar, intermaxillary fixation, and osteosynthesis. Results: The study included 1,162 patients (1,045 male and 117 female patients). A significant association was found between the presence of a third molar and the diagnosis of an isolated angle fracture (P < .0000005). Furthermore, assaults were associated with the presence of voluptuary habits (P < .00005), a younger mean age (P < .00000005), male gender (P < .00000005), and left- sided angle fractures (P < .00000005). Conclusions: Assaults and falls actually represent the most frequent causes of angle fractures. The presence of a third molar may let the force completely disperse during the determination of the angle fracture, finding a point of weakness.

Three piles were conducted: fine material (FM, screen underflow), coarse material (CM, oversize product), and mixed material (MM, mix FM and CM in 1:1). Results showed that the temperature trends of the three piles in different layers were highly repeatable during the thermophilic period. With the decrease of IPS, the heating rate and the highest temperature of the pile increased, the thermophilic period was prolonged, and the highest temperature area in the pile shifted to a lower layer. It also promoted the organic matter degradation, compost maturation, and nitrogen fixation effect. Composting had a good effect on the passivation of heavy metals, especially Cd, Cu, and Pb. The passivation effect on Cd and Cu was FM > CM > MM, and on Pb was CM > FM > MM. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, excitation-emission matrix, and thermogravimetric thermal analysis indicated that FM had the highest content of aromatic structure and humic-like substance on D40. The redundancy analysis revealed that MM was beneficial to improve the internal uniformity during composting.

However, there are many reported complications such as infection of pin site, vascular and neurological injury and the discomfort during walking. The purpose of this study is to introduce a novel internal distractible plate system (IDPS) and to validate of the finite element model of the femur and IDPS before clinical application and finite element analysis with multiple biomechanical factors. After validating the finite element model of femur and femur with IDPS using the structural stiffness and strain of cadaveric femur during compression test, biomechanical stability of a novel IDPS was analyzed. Reconstructed finite element models showed similar result comparing with the values of cadaveric test in vitro. Through validation procedures using the finite element model of the intact femur and the 30mmdistracted femur with the IDPS, the material properties and the coefficient of friction of the finite element models for finite element analysis can be understood as reliable. Also, clinical stability of a novel IDPS was confirmed.

The mathematical and biomechanical models that have been developed show limitations and the experimental studies are not able to reproduce muscle forces and internal stress distributions in the bone-implant interface and mandibular structure. In the present article we show a static simulator of the masticatory system to demonstrate in epoxy resin mandibular models, by means of 3D (three-dimensional) photoelasticity, the stress distribution using different osteosynthesis methods in the mandibular angle fractures. The results showed that the simulator and 3D photoelasticity were a useful method to study interactions between bone and osteosynthesis materials. The "Lock" systems can be considered the most favourable method due to their stress distribution in the epoxy resin mandible. 3D photoelasticity in epoxy resin models is a useful method to evaluate stress distribution for biomechanical studies. Regarding to mandibular osteosynthesis, "lock" plates offer the most favourable stress distribution due to being less aggressive to the bone.

Herein, we describe the first enantioselective resolution copolymerization of racemic aromatic 2,3-disubstituted cis-epoxides and CO2 using enantiopure dinuclear cobalt(III) complexes as catalyst under mild conditions, affording the corresponding polycarbonates with completely alternating structure and good enantioselectivity in the range of 70% to 97% ee. The isotactic polycarbonate from beta-methylstyrene oxide is a typical semicrystalline material, possessing a melting point of 241 C-o; while other isotactic-enriched copolymers from 2,3-disubstituted cis-epoxides bearing a substitute group on the aromatic ring are amorphous, having glass transition temperatures between 86 C-o and 124 C-o. Interestingly, the copolymer selectivity is correlated well with the Hammett substituent constant, and the highest polymer selectivity of 98% was found in the system using the epoxides bearing an electron-donating group on the benzene ring.

Schatzker II tibial plateau fractures: Anatomically precontoured locking compression plates seem to improve radiological and clinical outcomes	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Tibial plateau fracture; Schatzker II; Split depression; Osteosynthesis; Outcome	SPLIT-DEPRESSION FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; CONDYLAR FRACTURES; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ARTHROSCOPY; MANAGEMENT; STABILITY	Introduction: The design of anatomically precontoured locking compression plates (LCP) allows the placement of angular stable screws right underneath the reduced joint surface fragments. To date, there is a lack of evidence supporting the broad utilization of these implants in split depression fractures to the lateral tibial plateau. Thus, aim of the present matched pair retrospective cohort study was to investigate the radiological and clinical outcomes of anatomically precontoured LCP compared to conventional plate and screw osteosynthesis in Schatzker II fractures. Material and methods: The institutional databank was searched for Schatzker II fractures from 2010 to 2016. Patients that underwent open reduction and internal fixation with anatomically precontoured 3.5 mm LCP or conventional 4.5 mm L-shaped plates and screws were included. CT scans and radiographs were analyzed. Details of the operative procedures and secondary events were collected. A matched pair analyses was conducted in a best fit manner. The primary outcome parameter was the Rasmussen Radiological Score approximately one year postoperatively. Secondary outcome parameters were the medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), the Rasmussen Clinical Score and the WOMAC Score after a follow up of at least three years. Results: A total of 50 patients was included. Patient age, gender distribution, size and depression depth of the lateral joint surface fragments, frequency of utilizing bone grafts or substitutes and lateral meniscus repair as well as subsequent implant removal were comparable across the groups. Immediately post-operatively, the Rasmussen Radiological Score revealed no differences. After a mean of 64.2 weeks, the radiological outcome was significantly better in the LCP 3.5 group (RRS 8.2 vs. 6.3 points, p<0.001; MPTA 89.5 vs. 92.0 degrees, p = 0.001). After a mean clinical follow-up of 4.5 years, the Rasmussen Clinical Score (22.9 vs. 27.8 points, p<0.001) and the WOMAC score (24.3 vs. 16.0 points, p = 0.04) revealed significantly impaired results in the conventional group. Conclusion: Anatomically precontoured LCP prevent the subsidence of the reduced joint surface fragments more sufficiently and allow for improved patient outcomes compared to conventional plates and screws. The utilization of anatomically precontoured LCP should therefore closely be considered for internal fixation of any split depression fractures to the lateral tibial plateau. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

For polymer bone screw, it is difficult to achieve the bone stiffness and osteo-induction. Polymer composites may enhance bioactivity and mechanical properties but sacrifice the shape memory properties enormously. Herein, we fabricated a programmable bone screw which is composed of shape memory polyurethane, hydroxyapatite and arginylglycylaspartic acid to resolve the above problem. This composite has significantly improved mechanical and shape-memory properties with a modulus of 250 MPa, a shape fixity ratio of similar to 90% and a shape recovery ratio of similar to 96%. Moreover, shape fixity and recovery ratios of the produced SMPC screw in the simulative biological condition were respectively similar to 80% and similar to 82%. The produced screw could quickly recover to its original shape in vitro within 20 s leading to easy internal fixation. Additionally, the composite could support mesenchymal stem cell survival, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in vitro tests. It also promoted tissue growth and showed beneficial mechanical compatibility after implantation into a rabbit femoral intra-condyle for 12 weeks with little inflammation. Such bone screw exhibited a fast-fixing, tightened fitting, enhanced supporting and boosted bioactivity simultaneously in the defective bone, which provides a solution to the long-standing problem for bone repairing. We envision that our composite material will provide valuable insights into the development of a new generation of bone screws with good fixation and osteogenic properties. Statement of Significance The main obstacles to a wider use of a bone screw are unsatisfied stiffness, inflammatory response and screw loosening issues. Herein, we report a programmable screw with mechanically robust, bioactive and fast-fixing performances. The shape memory polymer composite takes advantage of the component in the natural bone and possesses a stable bush-like structure inside through the covalent bonding, and thus achieve significantly improved mechanical and memory properties. Based on its shape memory effect, the produced screw was proved to offer a recovery force to surroundings and promote the bone regeneration effectively. Therefore, the composite realizes our expectations on functions through structure design and paves a practical and effective way for the development of a new generation of bone screws.

Evidence supporting increased interest in internal fixation of forearm fractures has been controversial. We studied radiographic outcome and complications of both-bone diaphyseal middle-third forearm fractures according to the type of treatment. The purpose of the study was to determine if there is an advantage in invasive treatment over non-invasive treatment that supports the increasing trend towards invasive surgery. Materials and methods: All children and adolescents (<16 years) with both-bone diaphyseal middle-third forearm fractures in a geographic area with 86,000 children in 2000-2009 were included. There were 168 patients. The types of primary fractures and their malalignment and displacement rates were analysed. The fractures were classified as 'severe' or 'mild' according to radiographic findings. Radiographic fracture healing and alignment and the rate of complications were compared as regards invasive versus non-invasive surgery. Results: Just over a third of all patients suffered from some complication during follow-up. The overall complication rate was highest in the non-invasive treatment group (58%) and lowest in the intramedullary nailing group (24%) (P < 0.001). The difference was significant as regards both mild and severe fractures. Nearly a third of the fractures in the non-invasive treatment group were re-reduced during follow-up. Two third of them were finally fixed invasively. Re-reduction after invasive fixation was rare (1.4%, P = 0.001). Re-fracture was equally uncommon (7.1%) in both the invasive and non-invasive groups. Non-union was unusual (1.2%) and it was related to high-energy trauma or chronic disease. Nerve co-morbidity, scar problems, soft-tissue complications and compartmental syndrome were not problems in the study population despite the type of treatment. Conclusions: We found that the complication rate of diaphyseal forearm fractures was twice as common after non-invasive than after invasive treatment. The need of re-reduction after non-invasive treatment was remarkable. Nevertheless, bone healing was equally good despite the treatment. We conclude that intramedullary fixation of both-bone forearm fractures is a good mode of primary treatment of mild and severe middle-third diaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures.

In this article, the preparation of porous PLLA disks or cylinders with 50 and 65% void volume is presented. It is demonstrated that both a symmetric and asymmetric porosity can be generated within the disk itself. In addition, open- and closed-cell structures can also be prepared. The accelerated hi vitro degradation on symmetric open-cell porous PLLA disks and on the nonporous control indicate a similar behavior in terms of melting temperature and inherent viscosity of the remaining pieces of the specimens, but the crystallinity and the mass of the remaining fragments are much smaller for the porous specimens. The mechanical properties under compression are determined for open and closed-cell porous cylinders, porous tubes, and for the nonporous PLLA. The results highlight the excellent mechanical integrity of the prepared porous structures and demonstrate that such materials could have potential for use as biomedical implants.

Bovine lactoferricin, a kind of antimicrobial peptide, and sodium alginate (NaAlg) were loaded onto titanium surface through layer by layer assembly. The drug release, cytocompatibility and antimicrobial property against S. aureus and E. coil were studied by release experiment, osteoblast and bacterial cultures. Results indicated that samples with nanotubes of bigger diameter carried more drugs and had better biocompatibility, and drug-loaded samples acquired better biocompatibility compared with drug-free samples. Furthermore, the drug-loaded samples exhibited good initial antimicrobial property, but weak long-term antimicrobial property. Therefore, drug-loaded titanium with micro/nano structure, especially, of big diameter nanotubes, could be a promise material for medical implants, such as internal/external fixation devices.

Materials and Methods: Fifty polyurethane synthetic mandible replicas (Synbone, Laudquart, Switzerland) were used in this investigation. Five controls and 5 each of 4 different fixation modalities (3 bicortical positional screws in an inverted-L pattern, monocortical 4-hole straight plates, monocortical. 6-hole curved plates, and monocortical adjustable 4-hole slide plates) were subjected to vertical loading at the incisal edge and torsional loading at the molar region by an Instron 1331 (Instron, Canton, MA) servohydraulic mechanical testing unit. Mechanical deformation data within a 0 to 900 N range were recorded. Yield load, yield displacement, and stiffness were determined. Means and standard deviations were derived and compared for statistical significance using a Fisher's Protected Least Significant Differences Test with a confidence level of 95% (P < .05). Second-order polynomial best-fit Curves were also created for each group to further evaluate mechanical behavior. Results: For incisal edge loading, statistically significant differences were noted between the control group and all other groups for yield load and stiffness, and between the control group and straight, curved, and slide plates for yield displacement. Differences were also noted between the inverted-L and straight, strut, and slide plates for yield load; and inverted-L and straight, curved, and slide, as well as straight and slide for yield displacement. For molar loading, statistically significant differences were noted between the control group and all other groups for yield load and stiffness. Differences were noted between the slide and straight, curved, and control; as well as between the inverted-L and straight and strut plates for yield displacement. Lastly, differences were noted between the straight and curved plates, and the slide and straight, curved, and inverted-L for stiffness. Conclusion: in this in vitro study, differences were noted between the control and all experimental groups in their abilities to resist loads under all of the conditions tested. Differences were also noted among specific experimental groups. Yet when placed in the context of functional parameters, only the bicortical positional screws in an inverted-L pattern met the requirements for both molar loading and incisal edge loading.

The blood supply to the tibia is poor due to the small subcutaneous muscle tissues inside. Consequently, the tibia is prone to delayed fracture healing and nonunion of the fracture after surgery. In this case, we used porous tantalum metal plate to treat nonunion of a tibial fracture and achieved satisfactory therapeutic effects. For the first time in the field, we used 3D printing technology to fabricate porous tantalum metal plates for the treatment of tibial fractures. The resulting porous tantalum metal exhibited excellent mechanical and biological properties, and improved the therapeutic effects for the treatment of a tibial fracture nonunion. Porous tantalum metal plates have great application potential as a new implant material for internal fixation.

Estimation and control of bone drilling forces are critical to prevent drill-bit breakthrough, excessive heat generation, and mechanical damage to the bone. An experimental and computational study of drilling in cortical bone has been conducted. A 3D finite element (FE) model for prediction of thrust forces experienced during bone drilling has been developed. The model incorporates the dynamic characteristics involved in the process along with geometrical considerations. An elastic-plastic material model is used to predict the behaviour of cortical bone during drilling. The average critical thrust forces and torques obtained using FE analysis are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Detailed microstructural analysis and textural study showed significant increase in grain refinement through dynamic recrystallization and basal-texture strengthening after forging. As a result, 1.2 times improvement of strength and 2.3 times reduction in in vitro degradation rate were observed. Complete mitigation of E.Coli bacteria was noticed within 32 h of culture for both the alloys due to addition of Cu. In addition, non-toxic nature of the alloys was proven from the cell viability studies, suggesting that Mg-5Zn-0.5Zr-0.7Cu alloy has the potential to be used as internal fracture-fixation material.

Nevertheless, several biomechanical aspects of super-elastic staples are still unclear and require further exploration. Within this context, this study presents a combined experimental and computational approach to investigate the mechanical characteristics of super-elastic staples. Two commercially available staples with distinct geometry, characterized by two and four legs, respectively, were examined. Experimental four-point bending tests were conducted to evaluate staple performance in terms of generated forces. Subsequently, a finite element-based calibration procedure was developed to capture the unique super-elastic behavior of the staple materials. Finally, a virtual bench testing framework was implemented to separate the effect of geometry from that of the material characteristics on the mechanical properties of the devices, including generated force, strain distribution, and fatigue behavior. The experimental tests indicated differences in the force vs. displacement curves between staples. The material calibration procedure revealed marked differences in the super-elastic properties of the materials employed in staple 1 and staple 2. The results obtained from the virtual bench testing framework have showed that both geometric features and material characteristics had a substantial impact on the mechanical properties of the device, especially on the generated force, whereas their effect on strain distribution and fatigue behavior was comparatively less pronounced. To conclude, this study advances the biomechanical understanding of Nitinol super-elastic staples by separately investigating the impact of geometry and material characteristics on the mechanical properties of two commercially available devices.

This study evaluated the effect of the application of bioresorbable plates and screws for patients with condylar fractures, assisted by digital preoperative planning. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective interventional study. The sample was composed of 46 patients treated at the School of Stomatology of the China Medical University (Shenyang, China) from October 2016 through May 2018 for condylar fractures alone or in combination with other facial fractures. All patients underwent confirmatory preoperative computed tomography (CT) to obtain Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format data for preoperative designing. By digital designing, the authors confirmed operative plans for each patient. All 46 patients underwent bioresorbable osteosynthesis and underwent repeat CT on postoperative day 3. Postoperative clinical assessments included postoperative positions of the fracture segments, maximal mouth opening, lateral excursion movements, occlusal status, and patient satisfaction. These variables were used to assess postoperative efficacy. Results: The sample was composed of 46 patients who had open reduction with internal fixation on 52 sides. At the 3-month follow-up visit, the proportions of patients who were satisfied with the results and who achieved stable occlusion, appropriate maximal mouth opening, and flexible lateral excursion movement were 97, 100, 66, and 95%, respectively. One patient sustained postoperative displacement of a condylar fracture fragment, as confirmed by repeated CT. He was lost to follow-up at 3 months postoperatively. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that open reduction treatment of condylar fractures implanted with bioresorbable materials in combination with digital preoperative designing is an effective method for managing patients in clinical practice.

No consensus exists about the optimal type of implant and best internal fixation procedure, two parameters that directly govern the risk of the most common intraoperative and postoperative complications (diaphyseal fractures, dislocation, non-union). To minimise these risks, we developed a technique combining a transverse subtrochanteric shortening osteotomy, a long ovoid-profiled, cementless stem anchored in the metaphysis, and double tension-band wiring for internal fixation. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of this technique with emphasis on (i) complications and femoral implant survival, (ii) clinical outcomes (functional scores and lower-limb length inequality [LLLI]), and time to healing. Hypothesis: Our technique is associated with low rates of intraoperative and postoperative complications. Material and methods: This singlecentre retrospective cohort study included patients who underwent THA with a transverse subtrochanteric shortening osteotomy and fixation using double tension-band wiring to treat severe (Crowe III or IV) developmental hip dysplasia. The femoral implant was a long, ovoid, cementless stem fully coated with hydroxyapatite. We collected the intraoperative and postoperative complications, survival, LLLI, functional scores (Harris Hip Score [HHS] and Forgotten Joint Score [FJS]), patient satisfaction, and radiographic outcomes.Results: The study included 31 hips in 25 patients. Two patients (2/31 hips, 6.5%) were lost to followup, leaving 29 hips for the analysis of postoperative outcomes. Mean follow-up was 13.7 +/- 4.2 years (range, 5.8-18.3 years). The four intraoperative complications (4/31, 12.9%) consisted fracture of the diaphysis (2/31, 6.5%), fracture of the greater trochanter (1/31, 3.2%), and sciatic nerve injury followed by a full recovery (1/29, 3.4%). The 8 (8/29, 27.5%) postoperative complications consisted of dislocation (2/29, 6.9%), stem subsidence (2/29, 6.9%), and non-union (4/29, 13.8%). Femoral implant survival at last follow-up was 87.1% (95% CI, 76.1-99.7). The mean HHS increased from 39.6 +/- 12.0 (range, 14-61) before surgery to 81.7 +/- 13.2 (range, 48-100) at last follow-up (p < 0.01). The FJS at last follow-up indicated that the joint was forgotten in 14/29 (48.2%) cases and caused only acceptable symptoms in 9/29 (31.0%) of cases. Clinically significant (>= 1 cm) LLLI was present in 8/29 (27.6%) patients postoperatively compared to 19/29 (65.5%) preoperatively. The mean LLLI decreased from 20.8 +/- 19.7 mm (range, 0-60 mm) to 5.0 +/- 7.3 mm (range, 0-30 mm). Mean time to healing was 4.3 +/- 2.4 months (range, 2-11 months).Conclusion: Regarding these complex procedures, this technique was associated with low rates of intraoperative fractures and early postoperative complications. However, femoral stem survival was shorter than in earlier studies and the non-union rate was high, despite satisfactory functional and clinical outcomes.

We hypothesise that lower limb long bone loading differs with knee flexion angle during walking and frontal knee alignment, which affects fracture healing success. Materials and methods: Using our musculoskeletal in silico modelling constrained against in vivo data from patients with instrumented knee implants allowed us to assess internal loads in femur and tibia. These internal forces were associated with the clinical outcome of fracture healing in a relevant cohort of 178 extra-articular femur and tibia fractures in patients using a retrospective approach. Results: Mean peak forces differed with femoral compression (1,330-1,936 N at mid-shaft) amounting to about half of tibial compression (2,299-5,224 N). Mean peak bending moments in the frontal plane were greater in the femur (71-130 Nm) than in the tibia (from 26 to 43 Nm), each increasing proximally. Bending in the sagittal plane showed smaller mean peak bending moments in the femur (-38 to 43 Nm) reaching substantially higher values in the tibia (-63 to -175 Nm) with a peak proximally. Peak torsional moments had opposite directions for the femur (-13 to -40 Nm) versus tibia (15-48 Nm) with an increase towards the proximal end in both. Femoral fractures showed significantly lower scores in the modified Radiological Union Scale for Tibia (mRUST) at last follow-up (p < 0.001) compared to tibial fractures. Specifically, compression (r = 0.304), sagittal bending (r = 0.259), and frontal bending (r = -0.318) showed strong associations (p < 0.001) to mRUST at last follow-up. This was not the case for age, body weight, or localisation alone. Discussion: This study showed that moments in femur and tibia tend to decrease towards their distal ends. Tibial load components were influenced by knee flexion angle, especially at push-off, while static frontal alignment played a smaller role. Our results indicate that femur and tibia are loaded differently and thus require adapted fracture fixation considering load components rather than just overall load level.

An inter- and intra-observer reliability assessment	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Hip fracture; X-ray; AO/OTA classification; Inter-observer; Intra-observer; Reliability	LATERAL FEMORAL WALL; INTERTROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; PROXIMAL FEMUR; AO/OTA CLASSIFICATION; HIP-FRACTURES; AGREEMENT; PREDICTOR; FIXATION; TRENDS	Introduction: The most universal method for classifying pertrochanteric fractures is the AO/OTA classification. These fractures are classified into different categories according to the features found in the anteroposterior radiograph of the hip. Anteroposterior radiograph of the hip with internal rotation traction can improve the characterization of the fracture. Inter- and intra-observer reliability in any classification is essential to achieve a homogeneous agreement for decision making. Our objective is assessing the overall reliability and by level of experience of the new AO/OTA classification of pertrochanteric fractures. Materials and methods: A hospital registry was used to collect patients with pertrochanteric hip fracture who had anteroposterior radiograph of the hip with and without internal rotation traction. We selected six evaluators stratified by levels of expertise in orthopedic trauma, leaving three groups: advanced, intermediate and beginner. Radiographs were sent through electronic forms and inter- and intra-observer reliability was calculated using the kappa (K) statistic. Results: 115 (one hundred fifteen) patients were included, each with their corresponding anteroposterior radiograph of the hip with and without internal rotation traction. Overall inter- and intra-observer reliability was moderate on both anteroposterior radiographs of the hip with and without internal rotation traction. Regarding the different levels of experience, the advanced level group reached a substantial inter- and intra-observer reliability in both anteroposterior radiographs with and without traction, while the rest of the groups with lower level of experience obtained a lesser reliability. Conclusion: Our study found that the internal rotation traction x-ray did not improve the reliability of the new AO/OTA classification for pertrochanteric fractures, as assessed by inter- and intra-observer agreement, in either the overall group or in groups divided by experience level.

SoFCOT	Internal fixation of intra-capsular proximal femoral fractures in patients older than 80 years: Still relevant? Multivariate analysis of a prospective multicentre cohort	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Femoral neck fracture; Nutritional status; Autonomy; Aging	INTRACAPSULAR HIP-FRACTURES; NECK FRACTURES; MORTALITY; HEMIARTHROPLASTY; SURGERY; OUTCOMES; SCREW; DELAY	Background: Arthroplasty is now widely used to treat intra-capsular proximal femoral fractures (PFFs) in older patients, even when there is little or no displacement. However, whether arthroplasty is associated with lower mortality and complication rates in non-displaced or mildly displaced PFFs is unknown. The objectives of this prospective study were: (1) to evaluate early mortality rates with the two treatment methods, (2) to identify risk factors for complications, (3) and to identify predictors of functional decline. Hypothesis: Arthroplasty and internal fixation produce similar outcomes in non-displaced fractures of patients older than 80 years with PFFs. Material and methods: This multicentre prospective study included consecutive patients older than 80 years who were managed for intra-capsular PFFs at eight centres in 2014. Biometric data and geriatric assessment scores (Parker Mobility Score, Katz Index of Independence, and Mini-Nutritional Assessment [MNA] score) were collected before and 6 months after surgery. Independent risk factors were sought by multivariate analysis. We included 418 females and 124 males with a mean age of 87 + 4 years. The distribution of Garden stages was stage I, n=56; stage II, n=33; stage III, n=130; and stage IV, n=323. Arthroplasty was performed in 494 patients and internal fixation in 48 patients with non-displaced intra-capsular PFFs. Results: Mortality after 6 months was 16.4% overall, with no significant difference between the two groups. By multivariate analysis, two factors were significantly associated with higher mortality, namely, male gender (odds ratio [OR], 3.24; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.0-5.84; P< 0.0001) and high ASA score (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.07-2.26; P=0.019). Two factors were independently associated with lower mortality, with 75% predictive value, namely, high haematocrit (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-0.9; P=0.001) and better Parker score (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.8; P=0.01). The cut-off values associated with a significant risk increase were 2 for the Parker score (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3; P= 0.001) and 37% for the haematocrit (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.9-5.5; P=0.02). Complications occurred in 5.5% of patients. Surgical site infections were seen in 1.4% of patients, all of whom had had arthroplasty. Blood loss was significantly greater with arthroplasty (311 + 197 mL versus 201 + 165 mL, P < 0.0002). Dependency worsened in 39% of patients, and 31% of patients lost self-sufficiency. A higher preoperative Parker score was associated with a lower risk of high postoperative dependency (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.97; P=0.014). Discussion: Neither treatment method was associated with decreased mortality or better function after intra-capsular PFFs in patients older than 80 years. Early mortality rates were consistent with previous reports. Among the risk factors identified in this study, age, preoperative self-sufficiency, and gender are not amenable to modification, in contrast to haematocrit and blood loss. Conclusion: Internal fixation remains warranted in patients older than 80 years with non-displaced intracapsular PFFs. Level of evidence: III, prospective case-control study.

To explore the clinical effects of the cable-pin system and Kirschner wire tension band (TBW) internal fixation in the treatment of the olecranon fracture. Methods. Fifty patients with an olecranon fracture were treated in our hospital from April 2018 to March 2020. Patients were randomly divided into control and study groups. The control group was fixed with TBW, and the study group was fixed with the cable-pin system. The operation, the circumference difference between the injured limb and the healthy limb, the VAS score, the excellent and good rate, the recovery of the range of motion of the joint 1 year after operation, and the incidence of postoperative adverse reactions were compared between the two groups. Results. In terms of the operation of the two groups, the operation time, intraoperative blood loss, healing time, incision drainage, and hospital stay in the study group were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). In the comparison of the circumference difference between the injured limb and the healthy limb, there was no significant difference between the two groups before operation (P > 0.05), but the circumference difference between the injured limb and the healthy limb in the study group was lower than that in the control group at 24 hours, 72 hours, 7 days, and 30 days after operation, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the VAS score between the two groups before operation, but 7-day VAS scores at 12 h, 24 h, and 72 h after operation in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The excellent and good rate in the study group was excellent in 18 cases, good in 5 cases, fair in 2 cases, excellent in 7 cases, good in 6 cases, fair in 8 cases, and poor in 4 cases in the control group, and the excellent and good rate in the study group (100.00%) was higher than that in the control group (84.00%), and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The patients in the two groups were followed-up for one year, and there were no shedding cases in the two groups. In terms of the recovery of range of motion one year after operation, the scores of elbow flexion, extension/degree, and elbow function in the study group were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05), and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The incidence of postoperative adverse reactions in the study group (4.00%) was significantly lower than that in the control group (28.00%), and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The incidence of postoperative adverse reactions was significantly lower in the study group (4.00%) than that in the control group (28.00%), and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05), while only 1 patient in the study group had chronic pain, while 7 patients in the control group had incision ulcer (1 case), chronic pain (2 cases), and internal fixation loosening (4 cases). The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Conclusion. The cable-pin system for the treatment of an olecranon fracture has the advantages of simple operation, fast fracture healing time, and low incidence of complications, which is a kind of orthopedic internal fixation consumable material in line with biomechanical requirements of the human body.

High Velocity Gunshot Fractures of Humerus: Results of Primary Plate Osteosynthesis	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Gunshot; Humerus; Open fracture; Internal fixation	EXTERNAL FIXATION; SHAFT FRACTURES; MANAGEMENT; PRINCIPLES; INJURIES; WOUNDS	Background High velocity gunshot fractures usually seen in conflict zones, often mandate external fixation due to delayed presentation and associated contamination. In the presented observational study, we managed high velocity gunshot fractures of humerus with adequate debridement and primary plate osteosynthesis under controlled conditions with gratifying results. Material and Methods Eighteen consecutive cases of fracture of the humerus secondary to high velocity gunshot wounds with ages ranging from 28 to 45 years reporting within 6 h of the initial injury formed our study group. Immediate debridement, lavage and primary plate osteosynthesis was carried out following hemodynamic stabilisation and intravenous antibiotics. All the cases were followed up at 2, 4, 6 months, 1 year and then annual follow-up including telephonic follow-up for six patients. Results Fifteen cases of Gustillo Anderson type III A, two of type III B and one of type III C were managed with primary plate osteosynthesis. Brachial artery injury was addressed immediately, however injured radial nerve ends were tagged. Five cases showed delayed/non-union and were managed with decortication and autologous bone grafting. Two cases of deep infection could be managed with implant retention till union. The implants were removed following fracture consolidation. All the fractures united and no patient was left with sequelae of chronic infection. Conclusion Timely presentation of high velocity gunshot fractures of humerus teamed up with adequate debridement, soft tissue management and primary plate osteosynthesis can offer satisfactory outcomes. Associated vascular injury needs immediate attention. Nerve injuries can be addressed in a staged procedure. Our results have been satisfactory and add to the scant literature available on the subject, however further studies are warranted.

Although the induced membrane technique has been used for this problem, there is a 3% to 20.7% failure to eradicate infection, and there have been few reports about its use in tuberculous infection. We present our three-stage induced membrane technique (TSIMT) for treating infected bone defects of the lower extremity. Material/Methods: Forty-one adult patients with infected bone defects of the lower extremities treated by TSIMT were included in a retrospective case-series study between January 2013 and June 2018. The clinical, imaging and laboratory assessment outcomes were analyzed. Results: In the first stage, 3 patients had ankle tuberculous bone defects and 17 patients underwent 2-4 debridements. In the second stage, the average bone defect was 6.0 cm; 1 patient needed an anterolateral thigh flap to cover the wound. In the third stage, 10 patients underwent autograft mixed allograft, and 18 cases used internal fixation. The mean follow-up period was 23.3 months. All patients achieved bone union and clinical eradication of infection. Changes in Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) scores after 1 year of TSIMT and bone union time are associated with advanced age, longer duration of infected bone defects, active smoking, and external fixation (p<0.05), but are not dependent on bone defect size, debridement times, type of bone graft, or spacer-placing time (p>0.05). Conclusions: TSIMT is effective in treating infected bone defects of the lower extremities. Advanced age, longer duration of infected bone defects, active smoking, and external fixation adversely affect bone union and recovery of infected extremities in a limited time span.

Locked Dorsal Compression Plate Arthrodesis for Degenerative Arthritis of the Midfoot	JOURNAL OF FOOT & ANKLE SURGERY			English	Article						arthrodesis; fusion; internal fixation; ORIF; tarsometatarsal	PLANTAR INTERFRAGMENTARY SCREW; MEDIAL LOCKING PLATE; LAPIDUS ARTHRODESIS; METATARSOCUNEIFORM JOINT; OSTEOARTHRITIS; STABILITY; FIXATION; OUTCOMES; HINDFOOT; FUSION	Midfoot arthrodesis is the accepted surgical treatment for symptomatic midfoot arthritis. The published literature has focused on joint-spanning static fixation. Several companies have developed diamond-shaped locked dorsal compression plates, which allow for longitudinal joint compression. After dorsal plate insertion, a spreader device opens the arms of the plate mediolaterally, which allows the plate to compress longitudinally. This work describes outcomes of such locked dorsal compression plates for midfoot arthritis at a single institution. We reviewed 62 patients who underwent midfoot arthrodesis for symptomatic midfoot arthritis using locked dorsal compression plates over a 7-year period. A total of 173 joints were spanned for fusion. The primary outcome measure was radiographic union and visual analog scale pain scores. Characteristics of patients who experienced nonunion versus those who had union were evaluated. Of the 173 joints, there was a 81.5% fusion rate (141/173 joints) and 14 patients experienced nonunion. There was a statistically significant difference in the average number of joints spanned in patients with nonunion (3.6) and patients with union (2.5) (p =.02). Locked dorsal compression plate arthrodesis is a viable technique for achieving midfoot fusion. This mechanical method of compression does not, however, lend itself to improved fusion rates compared with prior reports. A greater number of arthrodesis sites is associated with a higher nonunion rate. Emerging technology using newer materials and improved biomechanical designs may show improved results.

JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							TERM SKELETAL STABILITY; MAXILLARY DISTRACTION; ORTHOGNATHIC SURGERY; MIDFACE; DEVICE; PALATE; ADVANCEMENT; HYPOPLASIA; OSTEOTOMY; SYSTEM	Purpose: The stability of distraction osteogenesis (DO) is an important issue in maxillary advancement for patients with cleft lip and palate (CLP). The aim of this study was to evaluate postoperative stability in patients with and without internal fixation after removing maxillary distraction devices. Materials and Methods: This randomized clinical trial assessed patients with CLP who needed maxillary advancement greater than 6 mm; they were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups. In group 1, distraction devices were removed 3 months after distraction and then 4 L miniplates were placed bilaterally in the maxilla. In group 2 (controls), no miniplates were placed after removing the distraction devices. Lateral cephalograms taken on 3 occasions (preoperatively, immediately after removing the distraction device, and after 18 months) were used to determine vertical and horizontal changes at the A point. Results: Twenty-two patients (n = 11 per group) were included. There was no significant difference between groups for horizontal relapse (P =.79). The results showed no significant difference for vertical relapse between the 2 groups (P =.11). The Pearson correlation test showed a correlation between the amount of advancement and horizontal relapse at the A point in group 1 (P =.01) and group 2 (P =.001). In group 1, for every 1-mm maxillary advancement, a 0.36-mm relapse was seen (B = 0.36, P =.01). In group 2, for every 1-mm maxillary advancement, a 0.43-mm relapse was seen (B = 0.43, P =.001). Conclusion: According to these results, rigid fixation after consolidation did not increase stability in patients with CLP after DO.

Materials and methods: Twenty-one left distal femoral fracture models were used in the study. Bones were divided into three equal groups. Group 1 specimens were fixed laterally by distal femoral anatomical locking plate. Group 2 specimens were fixed with retrograde distal femoral IM nail. Group 3 specimens were fixed with both distal femoral anatomical locking plate and retrograde distal femoral IM nail. In mechanical tests, alterations in axial loading, torsion angles, and load to failure values were measured and compared between groups. Results: Compared to group 1, group 2 was relatively more resistant in axial load tests (p=0.225), and significantly more resistant in load to failure tests (p=0.048). Group 1 was relatively more resistant in torsional load tests (p=0.949) compared to group 2. Group 3 was significantly more resistant than group 1 in axial (p=0.001), torsional (p=0.012) load tests and load to failure tests (p=0.008). Group 3 was significantly more resistant compared to group 2 in axial (p=0.003), torsional (p=0.008) load tests, and relatively more resistant (p=0.059) in load to failure tests. Conclusion: Thanks to its high mechanical strength and early mobilization capability, distal femoral anatomical locking plate and IM nail combination might be a choice of treatment in complicated osteoporotic or distal femoral fractures from high-energy trauma in young adults.

In vitro comparison of their effectiveness	KNEE SURGERY SPORTS TRAUMATOLOGY ARTHROSCOPY			English	Article						osteochondritis dissecans; internal fixation devices; biodegradable implants; materials testing; Meniscus Arrows	FRACTURE FIXATION; ASEPTIC SYNOVITIS; KNEE; FRAGMENTS; REPAIR; IMPLANTS; TISSUE	Three draw bench tests in axial direction were conducted of the pull out forces in predrilled human condylar bone of one single meniscus Arrow, one single metal screw, and three Meniscus Arrows in one bone block, the Arrows being inserted using the standard hand instruments. Bone blocks with three meniscus Arrows were tested additionally in tangential direction, imitating shear forces. All observed values were within the range of 1 standard error (SE) or higher and exceeded the values in meniscal tissue as reported in the literature. These are much higher than the shear force during a single movement in the human knee. Most metallic devices used for fixation of the fragments in the treatment of osteochondritis dissecans must be removed in a second operation. Left in place, as with the Herbert screws, they can disturb future imaging and damage the opposite cartilage of the tibia plateau. Staples left in place can break. Finally, some metals evoke allergic reactions and, at least in animals, are potent carcinogens. Although fusion of osteochondritis dissecans fragments in their original locations fixed with noncompressive biodegradable pins has been reported, these tests show the hold of compressive meniscus Arrows in bone to contribute to a better result than noncompressive pins. Other biodegradable devices are also available for this application. However, one advantage is that using meniscus Arrows, already available in the hospital for mending ruptured menisci, saves the costs of investing in other sets of instruments and devices. Another advantage is the smaller diameter of the meniscus Arrows than that of other biodegradable devices, resulting in less damage to the fragments.

Herein, we evaluated the clinical outcomes of patients with tibial nonunion treated with a new technique - minimally invasive percutaneous plate osteosynthesis (MIPPO) - combined with a new onionskin-like autologous bone grafting method. Material/Methods: From 2010 to 2013, 18 patients with tibial nonunions (average bone defect: 9.5 mm) were treated with MIPPO technology combined with onionskin-like autologous bone grafting. Indices for clinical evaluation included operative time, fluoroscopy time, blood loss, hospital stay, healing time, postoperative complaints, radiographic performances, the Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA) questionnaire, and the American Orthopedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score. Results: The average operation and fluoroscopy times for tibial nonunion were 65 min and 15.5 s, respectively, with a total blood loss of 107.7 mL. The mean duration of hospital stay was 12.8 days. The mean follow-up time was 11.9 months, and all patients achieved radiologically confirmed bony healing in an average time of 13.1 weeks. No lower-leg deformity, fixation failure, infection, and vascular, or nerve injuries were recorded in any patient, and only 4 patients complained of slight limb pain upon total weight-bearing at the end of follow-up. The SMFA and AOFAS ankle-hindfoot scores of patients were graded excellent in 14 (77.8%) and good in 4 (22.2%), indicating high functional recovery. Conclusions: MIPPO technology combined with onionskin bone grafting is an efficient method to treat patients with tibial nonunion, especially for patients with poor soft tissue condition.

Material and Methods The surgical records of 156 patients treated with rigid internal fixation after maxillofacial traumas were reviewed. Study variables included age, sex, site of fracture, site and number of plates, time of plate removal and reasons for plate removal. Results Of 384 plates used for fixation, 35 plates (9 %) in 21 patients (13.5 %) were removed due to hardware related complications. Statistical significance (p<0.01) was observed in mandibular body and parasymphysis fractures with regards to both fracture site location and plate removal rates. Most plates were removed within the first year after placement (p<0.01). The highest number of fractures were observed in the 20-30 years group (p<0.01) while most cases of removal were in the 30-40 years group (p<0.01). Secondary reconstruction/growth facilitation (11/156, 7 %) (p<0.01) was the main cause of plate removal while infection/wound dehiscence (9/156, 6 %) (p<0.01) was the main cause for complication related plate removal. A significantly greater number of plates placed via intraoral incisions (p<0.01) needed removal. Conclusions The low incidence of complication related plate removal (7 %) in the mid and upper face in this study suggests that routine removal of asymptomatic titanium miniplates after maxillofacial trauma at these sites may not be beneficial. The high rate of mandibular site complications (19 %) in this study suggests that routine removal of titanium hardware from mandibular sites may be indicated.

Dynamic external traction system for management of distal displaced fractures of the head of the proximal phalanx	CHIRURGIE DE LA MAIN			English	Article						proximal interphalangeal joint; dynamic external distractor; phalanx articular fracture	INTERPHALANGEAL JOINT; PILON FRACTURES; S-QUATTRO; FIXATION; DISLOCATION	Introduction. - Phalangeal fractures are generally underestimated injuries, but result in pain, stiffness, instability, degenerative arthritis and loss of finger function. Treatment varies from open reduction with internal fixation giving perfect anatomical reduction but a risk of side effects, to orthopaedic treatment with variable results. Unstable fractures must be fixed rigidly to minimize joint immobilization. It is this concept of solid fixation and early mobilization, which directed us in the choice of dynamic external distraction in the management of these fractures. Material and method. - The authors present a prospective study of twelve patients treated for unstable fractures of the proximal interphalangeal joint by closed reduction and dynamic external distractor, we describe this simple device created with pins and rubber bands and examine the functional clinical results.Results. - The average follow-up period was 7,5 months. We only noted one pin-track infection. Three patients complained of pain at postoperative follow up. In this series, the total active motion varied from 70 degrees to 120 degrees (average 94,16 degrees), the mean lack of extension was 5,6 degrees (from 0 to 15 degrees). Ten patients had good mobility and were satisfied. Discussion. - Different traction devices for the management of displaced intraarticular phalangeal fractures have been reported. Most of them are complex to construct and expensive. The traction system is simple to assemble, economical and it allows early active motion of the affected digits. We consider that it is an effective mode of treatment for the management of complex intraarticular phalangeal fractures. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. Tons droits reserves.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive electronic search was done for PubMed, Scopus, CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), and Google scholar databases. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the two treatment modalities for functional and clinical outcomes were eligible to be included. RESULTS: A total of 5 RCTs were included. The pooled estimates suggested reduced DASH scores (WMD 5.62; 95% CI, -8.55, -2.69) and improved grip strength [Grip strength compared to the contralateral side (%): WMD 13.07: 95% CI, 6.11, 20.02] in subjects receiving ORIF with volar plating. There were no significant differences in the range of motion of the wrist joint, pain scores. and rates of complications between the two treatment modalities. The overall quality of the included studies was moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that older adults treated with volar plating for fracture of distal radius have better DASH scores and improved grip strengths. However, improved DASH scores may not be clinically relevant. Furthermore, there may be no difference in pain scores, ROM, and the rates of complications between the two treatment modalities.

J	Gok, K; Inal, S				Gok, K.; Inal, S.			Biomechanical comparison using finite element analysis of different screw configurations in the fixation of femoral neck fractures	MECHANICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							INTERNAL-FIXATION; CADAVERS	In this research, biomechanical behaviors of five different configurations of screws used for stabilization of femoral neck fracture under axial loading have been examined, and which configuration is best has been investigated. A point cloud was obtained after scanning the human femoral model with a three dimensional (3-D) scanner, and this point cloud was converted to a 3-D femoral model by Geomagic Studio software. Femoral neck fracture was modeled by SolidWorks software for five different configurations: dual parallel, triple parallel, triangle, inverted triangle and square, and computer-aided numerical analysis of different configurations were carried out by ANSYS Workbench finite element analysis (FEA) software. For each configuration, mesh process, loading status (axial), boundary conditions and material model were applied in finite element analysis software. Von Mises stress values in the upper and lower proximity of the femur and screws were calculated. According to FEA results, it was particularly advantageous to use the fixation type of triangle configuration. The lowest values are found as 223.32MPa at the lower, 63.34MPa at the upper proximity and 493.24MPa at the screws in triangle configuration. This showed that this configuration creates minimum stress at the upper and lower proximity of the fracture line. Clinically, we believe that the lowest stress values which are created by triangle configuration encompass the most advantageous method. In clinical practices, it is believed that using more than three screws does not provide any benefit. Furthermore, the highest stresses are as follows: at upper proximity 394.79MPa in triple parallel configuration, for lower proximity 651.2MPa in square configuration and for screw 2459MPa in inverted triangle.

Objective: To evaluate the outcomes of myelopathy caused by atlantoaxial dislocation (AAD). Summary of Background Data: No reports to date have accurately evaluated the results of surgery for delayed myelopathy for patients with chronic AAD. Thus, the appropriate surgical time and methods of decompression and fusion remain a hot debate. Materials and Methods: In our study, 18 patients underwent decompression, fixation, and fusion. Demographic data, operation time, blood loss, and complications were evaluated. The Japanese Orthopedic Association Scale, severity of disability and visual analogue scale were evaluated. The fusion rate, space available for the cord, instability index, cord compression index, and cord decompression rate were also assessed. Results: The average time of operation was 248 +/- 50 minutes, and blood loss was 350 +/- 200 mL. Five patients in grade I maintained their neurological status, and the others had improved neurological status. With average follow-up time of 15.3 +/- 9.6 months, the Japanese Orthopedic Association score improved, the visual analogue scale score decreased, the space available for the cord improved, and the instability index and cord compression index decreased. Cord decompression rate was 65.9%. Fusion rate reached 83%. Conclusions: There is a high risk of delayed myelopathy for patients with AAD who do not undergo timely surgical treatment. There is no need for complete reduction for treatment of chronic AAD. Whether it can be reduced or not, sufficient decompression and solid fusion for AAD are required. Both C1-C2 fusion for reducible dislocation and occipital-cervical fusion for irreducible dislocation have satisfactory outcomes.

Percutaneous minimally invasive repair of acromioclavicular joint dislocation using cannulated screws under ultrasonic vs. C-arm navigation: A prospective trial	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Acromioclavicular joint dislocation; Internal fixation; Minimally invasive; Radiation dose; Ultrasonic navigation	CLAVICULAR HOOK-PLATE; RECONSTRUCTION; FIXATION; SEPARATIONS	Introduction: To compare percutaneous minimally invasive repair (PMIR) of acute acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocation under ultrasound guidance (PMIR-UN) vs. C-arm navigation (PMIR-CN). Hypothesis: PMIR-UN has similar functional and radiographic outcomes as PMIR-CN. Materials and methods: We treated 48 patients with acute grade III or V AC joint dislocation with surgical reduction and fixation with Kirschner wires and cannulated screws. The patients were randomly divided into a PMIR-UN group (n= 24) and a PMIR-CN group (n= 24). We assessed functional outcomes, operative duration, incision length, and intraoperative radiation exposure. Shoulder joint function was evaluated with the Constant-Murley score, and postoperative efficacy was evaluated using the Karlsson criteria. Results: The median follow-up duration was 13 months (range, 8-18 months). Satisfactory functional outcomes were obtained in both groups. Incision length, incidence of postoperative infection, pin migration, and postoperative efficacy did not differ between the two groups. Operative duration and intraoperative radiation dose were significantly greater in the PMIR-CN group than in the PMIR-UN group (P< 0.05). Kirschner wires were removed at 4 weeks after surgery, and cannulated screws were removed at 12 weeks after surgery in both groups. Discussion: Based on the satisfactory results obtained in all patients, we conclude that PMIR-UN is a safe, easy, and reliable technique for the treatment of acute grade III or V AC joint dislocation.

Proper reduction, stable internal fixation and early initiation of physiotherapy help to achieve a good functional outcome. Aim of this study was to evaluate varus fixation/malunion of proximal humerus fractures and its relation to functional outcome. Materials and Methods We retrospectively evaluated 32 patients with proximal humerus fractures who were surgically treated between 2015 and 2017 at tertiary care hospital. We divided the patients into three groups on the basis of the neck-shaft angle as valgus group, normal group and varus group to observe the influence of neck-shaft angle on efficacy. Patients were evaluated for functional outcome using the Constant-Murley score. Results Two-part fractures had better functional outcome (Constant score = 75.15) compared to three parts with the moderate functional outcome (Constant score = 68.81) and the four-part fracture had poor functional outcome (Constant score = 52.66). After 6 months of follow-up, 13 patients had a neck-shaft angle of less than 126 degrees. The functional outcome is significantly better among patients with normal neck-shaft angle and had a mean Constant score of 76.63 as compared to patients with varus deformity had a mean Constant score 60 (p = 0.001). 10 patients did not have medial support, in which 08 patients had neck-shaft angle less than 126 degrees and 2 had a normal neck-shaft angle. Conclusion High fracture comminution, improper restoration of medial continuity causes varus deformity of the humeral head and it leads to poor functional outcome. The small sample size is the limitation of our study.	[Kantharaju, H.] Govt Med Coll, Dept Orthopaed, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India; [Gawhale, Sangeet K.; Prasanna Kumar, G.

The purpose of this report is to describe patient outcomes after floating elbow injury using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) elbow assessment form. Materials and methods: From 1994 to 2004, 19 patients were retrospectively identified at 3 Level I trauma centers and returned for follow-up evaluation after treatment of their floating elbow injury. Patient outcomes were assessed based on physical examination and the ASES elbow form. Results: The 19 patients were evaluated at a mean of 6.7 years (range, 2.3-13.4 years) after treatment of their floating elbow injuries. The mean ASES elbow score was 89 (range, 13-99), and the mean visual analog scale satisfaction with elbow surgery was 8.7 (range, 7-10). Fifteen of 19 patients reported continued pain in the elbow. Patient age, arm dominance, type of humeral fixation, type of forearm fixation, open fracture, multiple surgeries, and fracture pattern were not significantly associated with outcomes. Nerve injury was associated with lower ASES elbow scores (P = .03). There was also a significant correlation between the ASES elbow score and follow-up time, indicating that patients with a longer duration of follow-up had better subjective outcomes (Spearman coefficient = 0.55; P = .02). Conclusion: Floating elbow fractures represent high-energy trauma and have significant associated injuries. Nerve injury is correlated with lower subjective outcomes. Patients continue to improve for several years with acceptable mid-term results. Level of evidence: Level IV, Case Series, Treatment Study.

We prospectively compared the results using DS approach and DP approach in these cases, with special focus on functional outcomes, complications, and ease of tuberosity reduction. Materials and methods 84 patients with three- and four-part proximal humerus fracture were alternately allocated the DP approach or DS approach for proximal humerus locking plate fixation. The outcome analysis was done by evaluating relative Constant score and ease of surgical reduction of greater tuberosity; radiological malunion was evaluated using Beredjiklian classification and complications were noted. Results At mean follow-up of 23 months (19-48 months), the mean 'relative Constant score was 74.27 +/- 8.19 in the DP group and 73.26 +/- 8.02 in the DS group and the difference was statistically insignificant (p = 0.988). There was no significant difference with respect to shoulder ROM, abductor strength, radiological malunion or complications. However, the mean surgical time was significantly less (p value = 0.042) in DS group (65 +/- 5 min) in comparison to DP group (92 +/- 4.3 min); significantly less difficulties were documented by the surgeon in reducing the greater tuberosity in DS group(p value = 0.02). Conclusion Although surgical time was reduced and greater tuberosity reduction was easier in DS group, the other outcomes were similar; either surgical approach can be used based, and can be based on the experience and comfort level of the surgeon.

Treatment is aimed to achieve anatomical reduction and ensure stability. Compared to non-locking plate locking plate provide stable construct and compromise bone vascularity less. However, there is increase wound complication with locking plates than non-locking plates. PHILOS plate combines the principles of fixation with a conventional plate with those of locking screws. The benefits of this implant are that it gives enhanced purchase in osteopenic bone. It is the first case series of studying the outcomes of modified use of PHILOS plate in lateral malleolus fracture. Materials and method: This is a non-commercialized retrospective case series which were done by a single surgeon at our university tertiary-care level-1 trauma hospital between May 2013 to August 2017. Cases of lateral malleolus fracture fixed with PHILOS included. Functional and radiological outcome were recorded from patients' files and radiographs. Results: Out of 13 patients 1 patient was lost to follow up. Mean time to union was 8.5 weeks. One patient developed superficial surgical site infection and implant was removed in 2 patients. Mean postoperative Olerud-Molander Ankle Score was 88.6 at last follow up. Conclusion: Modified use of PHILOS is neither the only nor the best means of achieving union, but rather it can offer significant advantages over previously described techniques and is a reasonable option in case of lateral malleolus fracture.

The goal of the present study was to compare the torsional performance of two commercially available frames, the Orthofix XCaliber and the Howmedica Hoffmann(R) II. Methods: The XCaliber and the Hoffmann(R) II were each applied to six fresh cadaver lower extremities and were loaded in a materials testing machine. Strain gauges were attached to the anteromedial cortex of the distal tibia, and each specimen underwent torsional and axial load testing, with and without the external fixator. A simulated pilon fracture was created, and torsional testing was repeated. Results: Results indicated that the XCaliber was significantly more rigid in internal rotation than the Hoffmann(R) II, before (49%) and after (41%) creation of the pilon fracture. Despite the XCaliber's increased rigidity relative to the Hoffmann(R) II (22% to 31%) in external rotation, statistical significance was not attained. Both fixators reduced strain (25% to 85%) at the anteromedial cortex upon torsional testing, but no significant differences between the two frames were noted. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that the XCaliber has mechanical advantages over the Hoffmann(R) II in terms of torsional rigidity for a tibial pilon fracture. Clinical Relevance: Increased rigidity of the XCaliber could potentially lead to decreased time to union, and a lower incidence of pin loosening and would prove beneficial in a setting in which the external fixator is used as the definitive fixation.

A Network Meta-analysis	CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH			English	Article							EXTERNAL FIXATION; INTRAMEDULLARY NAILS; BLOOD-FLOW; EPIDEMIOLOGY; QUALITY; COMPLICATIONS; MANAGEMENT; ENDER	Open tibial shaft fractures are one of the most devastating orthopaedic injuries. Surgical treatment options include reamed or unreamed nailing, plating, Ender nails, Ilizarov fixation, and external fixation. Using a network meta-analysis allows comparison and facilitates pooling of a diverse population of randomized trials across these approaches in ways that a traditional meta-analysis does not. Our aim was to perform a network meta-analysis using evidence from randomized trials on the relative effect of alternative approaches on the risk of unplanned reoperation after open fractures of the tibial diaphysis. Our secondary study endpoints included malunion, deep infection, and superficial infection. A network meta-analysis allows for simultaneous consideration of the relative effectiveness of multiple treatment alternatives. To do this on the subject of surgical treatments for open tibial fractures, we began with systematic searches of databases (including EMBASE and MEDLINE) and performed hand searches of orthopaedic journals, bibliographies, abstracts from orthopaedic conferences, and orthopaedic textbooks, for all relevant material published between 1980 and 2013. Two authors independently screened abstracts and manuscripts and extracted the data, three evaluated the risk of bias in individual studies, and two applied Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to bodies of evidence. We included all randomized and quasirandomized trials comparing two (or more) surgical treatment options for open tibial shaft fractures in predominantly (ie, > 80%) adult patients. We calculated pooled estimates for all direct comparisons and conducted a network meta-analysis combining direct and indirect evidence for all 15 comparisons between six stabilization strategies. Fourteen trials published between 1989 and November 2011 met our inclusion criteria; the trials comprised a total of 1279 patients surgically treated for open tibial shaft fractures. Moderate confidence evidence showed that unreamed nailing may reduce the likelihood of reoperation compared with external fixation (network odds ratio [OR], 0.38; 95% CI, 0.23-0.62; p < 0.05), although not necessarily compared with reamed nailing (direct OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.45-1.24; p = 0.25). Only low- or very low-quality evidence informed the primary outcome for other treatment comparisons, such as those involving internal plate fixation, Ilizarov external fixation, and Ender nailing. Method ranking based on reoperation data showed that unreamed nailing had the highest probability of being the best treatment, followed by reamed nailing, external fixation, and plate fixation. CIs around pooled estimates of malunion and infection risk were very wide, and therefore no conclusive results could be made based on these data. Current evidence suggests that intramedullary nailing may be superior to other fixation strategies for open tibial shaft fractures. Use of unreamed nails over reamed nails also may be advantageous in the setting of open fractures, but this remains to be confirmed. Unfortunately, these conclusions are based on trials that have had high risk of bias and poor precision. Larger and higher-quality head-to-head randomized controlled trials are required to confirm these conclusions and better inform clinical decision-making. Level I, therapeutic study.

J	Klima, M				Klima, Matthew			Bent or broken: analysis of set screw fracture in the TFNa implant	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS AND TRAUMATOLOGY			English	Article						Implant failure; Cephalomedullary nails; Locking mechanism failure; TFNa; Set screw; Set screw fracture	CEPHALOMEDULLARY NAIL FIXATION; INTERTROCHANTERIC HIP-FRACTURES; INTRAMEDULLARY FIXATION; FEMORAL FRACTURES; MEDIAL MIGRATION; FEMUR FRACTURES; FAILURE; BREAKAGE	Objectives To evaluate set screw fracture in the Trochanteric Femoral Nail Advanced implant (TFNa, Synthes, West Chester, PA) and to identify additional mechanisms of set screw failure in the TFNa. Materials and methods Patients who had experienced failure after open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with the TFNa were identified. TFNa implants were explanted and inspected following revision surgery. Medical device reports (MDRs) and manufacturer's inspection reports describing similar failures for the TFNa in the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database were also reviewed. Results Four set screw fractures that occurred at a level II trauma center were observed. Sixty-seven reported failures were identified in the MAUDE database for review. Twenty-eight failed implants were returned to the manufacturer for inspection with a published inspection report available for analysis. Set screw fractures can occur in the TFNa when the set screw is deployed prematurely into the proximal screw aperture prior to blade/screw insertion. The set screw can also bend and deform if it is advanced against a helical blade/lag screw that is not fully seated into position, thereby potentially compromising its function. Conclusion The TFNa set screw allows for potential fracture during implant insertion leading to uncontrolled collapse, early excessive proximal femoral shortening, and rotational instability of the helical blade/lag screw. Similar failures in the TFNa can be prevented by having the surgeon inspect the proximal screw aperture after attachment of the proximal aiming aim to ensure the set screw has not been deployed prematurely.

Eighteen patients with 21 fractures of the atrophic mandible, who had been treated between 1997 and 2006, were retrospectively analysed. Mandible height was categorised according to the Luhr classification and the patients' general health (The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification). Three types of titanium macroplates were used. Demographic data, treatment outcomes and the pre- and postoperative ability to wear mandible dentures were evaluated. The study population consisted of five men and 13 women with a median age of 78 years. The mean follow-up duration was 28 months. The most common cause of fractures was accidental falls (50%); the mandible was affected in 77.8%. Three fractures occurred in class I (bone height 15-20 mm), seven in class II (10-15 mm), and 11 in class III atrophy (< 10 mm). According to the ASA classification, the collective showed a mean value of 3. An overall complication rate of 16.7% was noted, consisting of two minor and one major complication that required a second intervention. Five patients needed removal of the osteosynthesis material for prosthetic reasons. Only 50% of the patients were able to wear their dentures before surgery, and all but one were able to wear their prosthesis postoperatively. Treatment of atrophic mandible fractures with macroplates by means of an extraoral approach showed good results and a low complication rate. This procedure allows elderly patients to instantly load the mandible in the means of prosthetic and masticatory rehabilitation, preventing the necessity for second interventions.

J	Forsberg, JA; Wedin, R; Bauer, H				Forsberg, Jonathan Agner; Wedin, Rikard; Bauer, Henrik			Which Implant Is Best After Failed Treatment for Pathologic Femur Fractures?	CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th Meeting of the International-Society-of-Limb-Salvage (ISOLS)	2011	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	Int Soc Limb Salvage (ISOLS)			SKELETAL METASTATIC LESIONS; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; COMPLICATIONS; ARTHROPLASTY; SURVIVAL; SURGERY; HIP	Successful treatment of pathologic femur fractures can preserve a patient's independence and quality of life. The choice of implant depends on several disease- and patient-specific variables; however, its durability must generally match the patient's estimated life expectancy. Failures do occur, however, it is unclear which implants are associated with greater risk of failure. We evaluated patients with femoral metastases in whom implants failed to determine (1) the rate of reoperation; (2) the timing of and most common causes for failure; and (3) incidence of perioperative complications and death. From a prospectively collected registry, we identified 93 patients operated on for failed treatment of femoral metastases from 1990 to 2010. We excluded five patients who subsequently underwent amputations leaving 88 who underwent salvage procedures. These included intramedullary nails (n = 11), endoprostheses (n = 61), and plate fixation (n = 16). The primary outcome was reoperation after salvage treatment. Seventeen of the 88 patients (19%) required subsequent reoperation a median of 10 months (interquartile range, 4-14) from the time of salvage surgery: 15 for material failure, one for local progression of tumor, and one for a combination of these. Five patients died within 4 weeks of surgery. Although perioperative complications were higher in the endoprosthesis group and dislocations occurred, overall treatment failures after salvage surgery were lower in the that group (four of 61) compared the group with plate fixation (eight of 16) and intramedullary nail groups (five of 11). Despite relatively common perioperative complications, salvage using endoprostheses may be associated with fewer treatment failures as compared with internal fixation. Level III, therapeutic study.

Seasonal Translocations of Nitrogen and Phosphorus in Two Lobelian Lakes in the Vicinity of Bytow, (West Pomeranian Lake District)	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES			English	Article						nutrients; eutrophication; stratification; lake water quality; biogeochemical cycle	SEDIMENTS; DYNAMICS; RELEASE; LIGHT; EUTROPHICATION; NETHERLANDS; OXYGEN; WATER; MODEL	The aim of this paper was to determine the nutrient translocations between different chemical forms (mineral and organic), as well as between different parts of a lake system (pelagic and benthic; epi- meta- and hypolimnion) in an annual cycle. Nitrogen and phosphorus content in lakes Jelen and Maly Borek were estimated in monthly intervals (except periods of ice cover). In both lakes the biggest amounts of pelagic P and N were recorded in autumn. With the beginning of the growth season the quick decrease of P-total in both lakes was observed, attributed to the sedimentation of the particulate organic material. At the end of spring phosphorus resources dropped by about 50%, and the biggest reduction was observed in epilimnion. Translocations of nitrogen during the vegetative period were poorly synchronized with phosphorus translocations. N-total stocks in water column during spring were increasing or stable. The increase was especially intensive in lake Jelen and was associated with cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation. This process was stopped and nitrogen resources started to decrease when phosphorus resources attained a minimum level. In the second half of summer (before autumn overturn) the amounts of N and P started to increase, due to enhanced migration of nutrients from sediments. During the winter period extensive nitrification was manifested by the downfall of ammonium and simultaneous growth of nitrate stocks. The lakes differ substantially in such features as the levels of ammonium concentration, rate of phosphate and ammonium accumulation in hypolimnion, or intensity of nitrogen fixation. Symptoms of internal loading with phosphorus and extensive nitrogen fixation were found in lake Jelen, one of the clearest lakes in Poland.

Materials and Methods: Fort), polyurethane resin replicas of human hemimandibles were used. The hemimandibles were sectioned to simulate a high subcondylar fracture and then stabilized with 2 fixing techniques using 2.0-mm system plates and screws. The fixation techniques were 2 separate 4-hole plates with 8 screws, and 2 overlaid 4-hole plates with 4 screws. Each system was submitted to load tests, with the application of the load in mediolateral and anteroposterior directions in an Instron 4411 universal assay machine (Instron, Norwood, MA). Results: Load values and peak displacement were measured. Means and standard deviations were evaluated by analysis of variance (P < .05) and Tukey tests, in which it was verified that the anteroposterior peak load value was affected by the arrangement of the plates on the models, although no differences were observed between the groups for the mediolateral peak load. The arrangement of the plates did not have any influence on peak displacement. Similarly, the final value of the mediolateral load was not affected by the arrangement of the plates on the model. Conclusion: The experimental model with 2 separate plates was statistically superior to the model with 2 overlaid plates only in relation to anteroposterior peak load. Despite showing superiority in mediolateral peak load and peak displacement, there was no statistical difference between the groups for these parameters.

Distal femoral replacement in periprosthetic fracture around total knee arthroplasty	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Distal femoral replacement; Periprosthetic fracture; Total knee replacement	KINEMATIC ROTATING HINGE; FIXATION	Introduction: Total knee arthroplasty is a common orthopaedic procedure in the UK; consequently, revision surgery and periprosthetic fractures are increasing in incidence. Strategies for management of these cases include non-operative strategies, internal plate fixation and revision of the distal femoral component. One under-reported practice is to perform distal femoral replacement in cases with poor distal femoral bone stock. Materials and methods: The department's electronic database was searched for all patients undergoing revision of total knee arthroplasty. From these, all patients having distal femoral replacement for periprosthetic fracture around the distal femoral component using the Stryker Global Modular Replacement System (GMRS) implant were filtered. A retrospective analysis of the patient notes was performed to examine the patient demographics, surgical factors and postoperative complications. Postoperative scores were performed for these patients. Results: From 2005 onwards, 11 patients (mean age 81 years, range 61-90 years) had their implants revised with a distal femoral replacement for periprosthetic fracture with associated poor bone stock. Follow up was for a mean of 33 months (range 4-72 months). One of these patients died of causes unrelated to their operation. Of the rest, all implants survived without the need of re-operation. The mean postoperative Oxford Knee Score for these patients was 22.5 (range 5-34). Conclusions: Distal femoral replacement for patients with fracture around a total knee arthroplasty has been performed in our department with few complications and acceptable functional outcomes. It is a technically challenging operation and it should be a salvage procedure reserved for patients with poor bone stock and low demands where other methods of fixation are not suitable.

Iso-C3D navigation assisted pedicle screw placement in deformities of the cervical and thoracic spine	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Navigation; pedicle screw fixation; thoracic and cervical deformity	IDIOPATHIC SCOLIOSIS; MORPHOMETRIC-ANALYSIS; ANATOMIC CONSIDERATION; COMPARATIVE ACCURACY; INTERNAL-FIXATION; LUMBAR; COMPLICATIONS; INSERTION; SURGERY; INSTRUMENTATION	Background : Pedicle screw instrumentation of the deformed cervical and thoracic spine is challenging to even the most experienced surgeon and associated with increased incidence of screw misplacement. Iso-C3D based navigation has been reported to improve the accuracy of pedicle screw placement, however, there are very few studies assessing its efficacy in the presence of deformity. We conducted a study to evaluate the accuracy of Iso-C3D based navigation in pedicle screw fixation in the deformed cervical and thoracic spine. Materials and Methods : We inserted 98 cervical pedicle screws (18 patients) and 242 thoracic pedicle screws (17 patients) using Iso-C3D based navigation for deformities of spine due to scoliosis, ankylosing spondylitis, post traumatic and degenerative disorders. Two independent observers determined and graded the accuracy of screw placement from postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans. Results : Postoperative CT scans of the cervical spine showed 90.8 perfectly placed screws with 7 (7) grade I pedicle breaches, 2 (2) grade II pedicle breaches and one anterior cortex penetration (< 2mm). Five lateral pedicle breaches violated the vertebral artery foramen and three medial pedicle breaches penetrated the spinal canal; however, no patient had any neurovascular complications. In the thoracic spine there were 92.2 perfectly placed screws with only six (2) grade II pedicle breaches, eight (3) grade I pedicle breaches and five screws (2) penetrating the anterior or lateral cortex. No neuro-vascular complications were encountered. Conclusion : Iso-C3D based navigation improves the accuracy of pedicle screw placement in deformities of the cervical and thoracic spine. The low incidence of pedicle breach implies increased safety for the patient.

The optimal pull-out strength can be achieved by a screw which fits into the pedicle medulla. The aim of the present study was to compare the inner and outer pedicle diameters of lumbar pedicles, to determine the inner/outer pedicle diameter ratios, and to develop a simple measure for estimating optimal pedicular screw size. Material and methods: 178 lumbar pedicles of 20 patients were evaluated. Inner and outer pedicle diameters of lumbar vertebrae were measured in computed tomography (CT). A simple linear regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between the inner and outer pedicle diameters. Results: The widest pedicle Outer diameter was seen at L5, with a mean of 16.53 +/- 1.899 mm. The narrowest pedicle Outer diameter was seen at L1, with a mean of 8.310 +/- 1.870 mm. The maximum inner pedicle diameter was at the L5 level, with a mean of 11.416 +/- 2.664 mm, whereas the minimum was at the L I level, with a mean of 5.510 +/- 1.887 mm. The regression coefficient between the inner and Outer pedicle diameter was 0.68 for all pedicles combined. Conclusions: We have demonstrated the relation of the inner and outer pedicle diameter of lumbar pedicles and described an easy and reliable method to estimate the inner pedicle diameter from the outer diameter on CT	[Kaptanoglu, Erkan; Cemil, Berker; Gurcay, Ahmet Gurhan; Tun, Kagan] Ankara Numune Training & Res Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, TR-06550 Ankara, Turkey; [Cevirgen, Banu] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Stat, TR-06531 Ankara, Turkey	Ankara Numune Training & Research Hospital; Middle East Technical University	Kaptanoglu, E (corresponding author), Ankara Numune Training & Res Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, TR-06550 Ankara, Turkey.	erkankaptanoglu@gmail.com	Kaptanoglu, Erkan/JVD-8616-2023; Cemil, Berker/HHM-5445-2022						31	2	2	0	2	TERMEDIA PUBLISHING HOUSE LTD	POZNAN	WENEDOW ST 9-1, POZNAN, 61-614, POLAND	0028-3843			NEUROL NEUROCHIR POL	Neurol.

High non-union and delayed union rates have led to an increased use of bone graft and bone graft substitutes. It was our goal to see if addition of a bone slurry could accelerate the rate of healing. Materials and Methods: We compared the radiographic healing after ankle arthrodesis in two groups of patients treated over 3 years with and without a 'bone slurry.' In group one, a slurry of bone particles was generated with a low-speed burr and left in the joint before internal fixation. Group two had similar fixation but no bone slurry. Two reviewers, blinded to the presence or absence of slurry, studied magnified digital radiographs at 6 and 12 weeks. The percentage of the joint bridged by bone was recorded for each and the groups were averaged. Groups were compared using Wilcoxon rank sum. Results: There were 32 patients in group one and 22 in group two. Groups were similar in age, gender and diagnosis. At 6 weeks, group one had 94.1% bridging bone, as measured on AP radiographs. Group two had 76.4% bridging bone. (Wilcoxon rank sum test p = 0.0099). At 12 weeks, group one had 98.1% bridging bone and group two had 85.7% bridging bone (Wilcoxon rank sum test p = 0.026). Conclusion: Use of a low-speed burr to generate a "bone paste" from the local bone surfaces was associated with an increased percentage of healed bone surface at 6 and 12 weeks in patients undergoing ankle arthrodesis.

The secondary purpose was to compare the mechanical behaviour of locking bolts and conventional locking cancellous screws. Methods: 7 pairs of fresh frozen human humeri were allocated to two equal groups. All specimens were fixed with the CF-PEEK plate. Cancellous screws (PEEK/screw) were compared to locking bolts (PEEK/bolt) for humeral head fixation. Stiffness, fracture gap deflection and ultimate load as well as load before screw perforation of the articular surface were assessed. Results were compared between groups and with pre-existing biomechanical data of a titanium-alloy plate. Results: The CF-PEEK plate featured significantly lower stiffness compared to the titanium-alloy plate (P < 0.001). In ultimate load testing, 6 out of 14 CF-PEEK plates failed due to irreversible deformation and cracking. No significant difference was observed between results of groups PEEK/screw and PEEK/bolt (P > 0.05). Discussion: The CF-PEEK plate has more elastic properties and significantly increases movement at the fracture site of an unstable proximal humeral fracture model compared to the commonly used titaniumalloy plate. The screw design however does neither affect the constructs primary mechanical behaviour in the constellation tested nor the load before screw perforation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mechanical performance of thoracolumbosacral pedicle screw systems: An analysis of data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration	JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS			English	Article						Thoracolumbosacral pedicle screw systems; Mechanical testing; Spinal devices; Posterior instrumentation; Posterior spinal fixation systems; ASTM F1717; ASTM F1798; ASTM F543	INTERNAL-FIXATION; LUMBAR SPINE; COMPLICATIONS; SURGERY; LOADS; RODS	Thoracolumbosacral pedicle screw systems (TPSSs) are spinal implants commonly utilized to stabilize the spine as an adjunct to fusion for a variety of spinal pathologies. These systems consist of components including pedicle screws, rods, hooks, and various connectors that allow the surgeon to create constructs that can be affixed to a wide range of spinal anatomy. During the development and regulatory clearance process, TPSSs are subjected to mechanical testing such as static and dynamic compression bending per ASTM F1717, axial and torsional grip testing per ASTM F1798, and foam block pullout testing per ASTM F543. In this study, design and mechanical testing data were collected from 200 premarket notification (510(k)) submissions for TPSSs submitted to FDA between 2007 and 2018. Data were aggregated for the most commonly performed mechanical tests, and analyses were conducted to assess differences in performance based on factors such as component type, dimensions, and materials of construction. Rod material had a significant impact on construct stiffness in static compression bending testing with cobalt chromium rods being significantly stiffer than titanium rods of the same diameter. Pedicle screw type had an impact on compression bending yield strength with monoaxial screws having significantly higher yield strength as compared to polyaxial or uniplanar screws. Axial and torsional gripping capacities between components and the rods were significantly lower for cross-connectors than the other component types. The aggregated data presented here can be utilized for comparative purposes to aid in the development of future TPSSs.

Material and methods: Between January 2002 and August 2005, 15 patients with thoracic spinal tumours underwent surgical treatment with instrumental stabilization at the Department of Neurosurgery, Warsaw Medical School, Poland. Seven patients with tumours localized in vertebral bodies or vertebral bodies and pedicles were operated on via an anterior approach with concomitant stabilization at the same operative procedure. In 5 patients with metastatic involvement of vertebral arches and pedicles, a posterior approach for tumour removal was used with concomitant posterior fixation at the same operative procedure. Two patients with multiple spine metastases underwent internal fixation at the level corresponding to the observed symptoms. In 1 patient with bilateral lung cancer and vertebral body involvement, posterior stabilization with decompression of nervous structures was performed. Results: None of the patients neurologically deteriorated after surgery. All patients with neurological deficits improved while one patient with pain syndrome did not. In 1 case approach-related surgical complications were observed. Conclusions: Regarding the complexity of surgical treatment of spinal metastases, the presented material is clearly not sufficient to draw firm conclusions. However, according to the authors' experience, the treatment of choice in single spinal metastasis involving the vertebral body is tumour removal via an anterior approach followed by adjunctive therapy. In metastatic lesions localized in vertebral pedicles and arches, removal via a posterior approach with concomitant posterior stabilization at the same operative procedure and adjunctive therapy is most indicated. Posterior stabilization of the spinal cord segment corresponding with symptoms is considered an appropriate surgical treatment of multiple spinal metastases.

The purpose of this retrospective study is to compare the clinical and radiological outcomes of MM fractures fixed with either bioabsorbable Mg screws or conventional titanium screws. Materials and methods A cohort of 48 patients with MM fractures who underwent compression screw fixation was retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-three patients (16 male, 7 female; mean age: 37.9 +/- 17.7 years) were treated with bioabsorbable Mg screws, and 25 patients (14 male, 11 female; mean age: 45.0 +/- 15.7 years) were treated with conventional titanium screw fixation. All patients were followed up for at least 1 year, with a mean time of 24.6 +/- 10.5 months (12-53 months). The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scale was used to evaluate the clinical results. The Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) osteoarthritis grading was used to evaluate posttraumatic osteoarthritis on final ankle radiographs. Fracture union, rate of implant removal, and complications were recorded. Comparative analysis of two independent groups was performed using the chi-squared test and the Mann-Whitney U-test. Results The two groups were comparable concerning demographic and clinical characteristics. Age (p = 0.146), sex (p = 0.252), side (p = 0.190), MM fracture type (p = 0.500), associated fractures (p = 0.470), and follow-up period (p = 0.903) were similar between the groups. At final follow-up examination, AOFAS score (p = 0.191) was similar between groups. Fracture union was achieved in all cases. Grade of posttraumatic osteoarthritis, according to KL, was equally distributed in both groups (p = 0.074). No deep infection or osteomyelitis was seen. Five patients in the titanium screw group underwent implant removal, due to pain in three of them and difficulty in wearing shoes in the other two (p = 0.031). Implant removal was performed after a mean of 14.2 +/- 3.1 months (12-19 months). Conclusions Bioabsorbable Mg and titanium screws had similar therapeutic efficacy in MM fracture fixation regarding functional and radiological outcomes. However, the rate of implant removal was higher with titanium screws. Bioabsorbable Mg screws may be a favorable fixation option since secondary implant removal procedures can be prevented.

The fixation rate of the markers using the bronchial insertion technique, reliability of the setup using markers around the target volume, dislocation of the markers after real-time tumor-tracking RT, and long-term toxicity of marker insertion were investigated. Methods and Materials: Between July 2000 and April 2004, 154 gold markers were inserted into 57 patients with peripheral lung cancer. The distances between the implanted markers in 198 measurements in 71 setups in 11 patients were measured using two sets of orthogonal diagnostic X-ray images of the real-time tumor-tracking RT system. The distance between the markers and the chest wall was also measured in a transaxial CT image on 186 occasions in 48 patients during treatment planning and during follow-up. The median treatment time was 6 days (range, 4-14 days). Results: In 115 (75%) of the 154 inserted markers, the gold marker was detected throughout the treatment period. In 122 markers detected at CT planning, 115 (94%) were detected until the end of treatment. The variation in the distances between the implanted markers was within +/- 2 mm in 95% and 1 mm in 80% during treatment. The variation in the distances between the implanted markers was > 2 mm in at least one direction in 9% of the setups for which reexamination with a CT scan was indicated. The fixation rate in the left upper lobe was lower than in the other lobes. A statistically significant relationship was found between a shorter distance between the markers and the chest wall and the fixation rate, suggesting that the markers in the smaller bronchial lumens fixed better than those in the larger lumens. A learning curve among the endoscopists was suggested in the fixation rate. The distance between the markers and the chest wall changed significantly within a median of 44 days (range, 16-181 days) after treatment. Conclusion: The fixation of markers into the bronchial tree was useful for the setup for peripheral lung cancer and had an accuracy of 2 mm during the 1-2-week treatment period. The relationship between the markers and tumor can change significantly after 2 weeks, suggesting that adaptive four-dimensional RT is required. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Twenty-one subjects underwent pre-implant maxillary alveolar ridge augmentation with mandibular cortical bone blocks using u-HA/PLLA or u-HA/PLLA/PGA screws for fixation. Six months later, specimens of these screws and their adjacent tissue were retrieved. A histological and immunohistochemical evaluation of these samples was performed using collagen 1a, ALP (alkaline phosphatase), and osteocalcin. We observed that alveolar bone augmentation was successful for all of the subjects. Upon histological evaluation, the u-HA/PLLA screws had merged with the bone components, and the bone was directly connected to the biomaterial. In contrast, direct bone connection was not observed for the u-HA/PLLA/PGA screw. Immunohistological findings showed that in the u-HA/PLLA group, collagen 1a was positive for fibers that penetrated vertically into the bone. Alkaline phosphatase was positive only in the u-HA/PLLA stroma, and the stroma was negative for osteocalcin. In this study, u-HA/PLLA showed a greater bioactive bone conductivity than u-HA/PLLA/PGA and a higher biocompatibility for direct bone attachment. Furthermore, u-HA/PLLA was shown to have the potential for bone formation in the stroma.

In this retrospective study, we assessed the incidence, risk factors, management and outcomes of refracture after plate removal of midshaft clavicle fractures after bone union.Materials and methods Three hundred fifty-two patients diagnosed with acute midshaft clavicle fractures who had complete medical records from primary fractures to refracture were recruited. Details of imaging materials and clinical characteristics were carefully reviewed and analysed.Results The incidence rate of refracture was 6.5% (23/352), and the average interval from implant removal to refracture was 25.6 days. Multivariate analysis showed that the risk factors were Robinson type-2B2 and fair/poor reduction. Females were 2.4 times more likely to have refracture, although it was not significant in multivariate analysis (p = 0.134). Postmenopausal females with a short interval (= 12 months) from primary surgery to implant removal had a significant risk for refracture. Tobacco use and alcohol use during bone healing were potential risk factors for male patients, although they were not significant in multivariate analysis. Ten patients received reoperation with or without bone graft, and they had a higher rate of bone union than 13 patients who refused reoperation.Conclusio nThe incidence of refracture following implant removal after bone union is underestimated, and severe comminute fractures and unsatisfactory reduction during primary surgery are risk factors. Implant removal for postmenopausal female patients is not recommended due to a high rate of refracture.

LCP, however, is mechanically underpowered when made up of biodegradable materials (even with Mg-alloy). The biodegradable implant plate should not only exhibit adequate mechanical performance during implantation but also perform well after fracture, at least until complete healing of the fractured bone. With the aim of achieving enhanced mechanical performance, the design of the LCP has been modified to the design of Biodegradable Locking Compression Plate (BLCP) by adding a suitable thickness in the middle (only 4.6% of the total volume of the LCP), which may help retain some additional strength during implantation and after degradation. Both BLCP and LCP have been comparatively analyzed via FEM with the aid of axial compression and four-point bending tests. BLCP has a better mechanical capability of withstanding loads in its degraded form than in its non-degradable form. Furthermore, BLCP is up to 15.83% mechanically better in the non-degraded form as compared to LCP, which again becomes up to 100% more mechanically adequate in the degraded forms of BLCP than in LCP. BLCP is found safe for degradation up to 2 mm or 6 months with an estimated degradation rate of 4 mm/year, which may allow it to support fractured bone for at least the standard healing time. BLCP can be considered as a superior biodegradable bone implant plate after experimental assurance with the physiological environment and may replace LCP.

Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 40 patients (male: female = 15: 25, median age = 68 years) who underwent TAE from 2006 to 2016: 77.5% underwent total hip arthroplasty, 20% open reduction internal fixation, and 2.5% external fixation. Preangiographic multidetector computed tomography angiography was performed in 20 (49%) cases, and 9 of them showed arterial extravasation. Twenty-seven TAEs were performed within a week from surgery; active bleeding was seen in 33 (80.5%) angiograms. Gelatin sponge, microparticles, coils, n-butyl cyanoacrylate, and combinations of them were used as embolic materials. Results: Bleeding was controlled in all cases. The most frequently embolized arteries were branches of the deep femoral artery (n = 17). Permanent embolization agents (microparticles, coils, n-2-butylcyanoacrylate) were used in 88% of cases; temporary agents (gelfoam) in 12%. One procedure was complicated by arterial dissection. Hospital discharge averaged 20 days post-TAE (median = 17, range = 3-104). One-month survival rate was 97.5%. One patient died of ischemic bowel perforation. Conclusion: TAE is safe and effective in stopping the bleeding of the hip region and should be performed early, to avoid irreversible ischemic damage. Multidetector computed tomography angiography can be used to confirm doubtful evidence of ongoing bleeding. Several embolic materials can be used, each one offering different advantages. Low complication and mortality rates were observed. TAE seems to be the ideal first-line intervention when postoperative bleeding of the operated hip is detected. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

J	Inada, N; Wildermuth, MC				Inada, N; Wildermuth, MC			Novel tissue preparation method and cell-specific marker for laser microdissection of <i>Arabidopsis</i> mature leaf	PLANTA			English	Article						Arabidopsis thaliana; epidermal; laser microdissection; mesophyll; microwave method; tissue-specific marker	GENE-EXPRESSION PROFILES; CAPTURE MICRODISSECTION; CARBONIC-ANHYDRASE; PROTEOMIC ANALYSIS; IDENTIFICATION; FIXATION; DATABASE; CUT1; TOOL	Laser microdissection (LMD) is a powerful tool to isolate pure cell populations from heterogeneous tissues. This system has been successfully used for animal research; however, the reports of its application to plant tissues remain limited. One of the challenges of LMD for plant material is the tissue preparation. Although cryosectioning is commonly used for animal tissues, this is not a desirable method for fragile plant material with large central vacuoles. While paraffin preparation provides high histological quality and stability, the procedure is highly time consuming and may result in degradation of molecules of interest. In addition, conventional fixation and paraffin preparation methods do not preserve the structural integrity of very delicate plant tissues such as mature Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. Here, we used the rapid microwave paraffin preparation method with no fixative for preparation of Arabidopsis leaf tissue for LMD. This method resulted in Arabidopsis leaf sections with excellent preservation of leaf internal structure as evidenced by well-defined vascular bundles, phloem, and chloroplasts, and expanded and rounded epidermal cells. RNA extracted from leaf epidermal and mesophyll cells was of sufficient yield and specificity to use in downstream applications such as microarray analysis of the amplified mRNA. We employed the mesophyll cell-specific molecular marker, chloroplastic carbonic anhydrase, and developed an epidermal cell-specific marker, the very-long-chain fatty acid-condensing enzyme, CUT1, to assess specificity of harvested Arabidopsis leaf cell types by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The described method is also likely to be superior for the preparation of other fragile botanical tissue for LMD and downstream applications.

Lower limb reconstruction involving osteosynthesis material: A retrospective study on propeller flaps outcomes	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Lower limb; Propeller perforator flap; Bone fracture; Soft tissue defect		Introduction: Reconstruction of soft tissue defects in lower limb fractures requiring internal fixation remains a challenging scenario with the optimal surgical treatment still debated. This study aims to recommend, and eventually redefine, surgical indications for propeller flaps reconstruction in the distal lower limb, with a particular focus on the presence or not of metalwork. Methods: A retrospective study of lower limb soft tissue reconstructions performed between January 2015 and July 2018 was carried out including all patients treated with a propeller perforator flap (PPF) with at least 6-month follow-up. Patients were further divided in 2 groups depending on the presence of metalwork fixation beneath the flap (F group, propeller on Framework; NF group, propeller with No Framework). Results: 21 patients were retained (F group, 11 patients; NF group, 10 patients). There were no significant differences between the two groups in age, BMI, ASA scores, comorbidities or defect size. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups (p < 0.05) in the cumulative hospital stay with a mean cumulative hospital stay of 22 +/- 9 days in the F group and 12 +/- 8 days in NF group. Failures were higher where PPF were used to cover hardware material, with 3 patients requiring a major secondary procedure in F group versus 1 patient in NF group. Conclusion: The presence of underlying metalwork significantly reduced the margin for small, day-case revision procedures such as flap readvancement or STSG. This study emphasizes clinical intuition that whilst PPF are a useful and elegant tool in lower limb reconstruction, their use should be limited when underlying metalwork is present.

Transplantation of a vascularized rabbit femoral diaphyseal segment: Mechanical and histologic properties of a new living bone transplantation model	MICROSURGERY			English	Article							POLY-L-LACTIDE; INTRAMEDULLARY FIXATION; FASCIOCUTANEOUS FLAPS; LONGITUDINAL GROWTH; IN-VIVO; ALLOGRAFTS; FEMUR; OSTEOTOMIES; RODS; GRAFTS	A new vascularized bone transplantation model is described, including the anatomy and surgical technique of isolating a rabbit femoral diaphyseal segment on its nutrient vascular pedicle. The histologic and biomechanical parameters of pedicled vascularized femoral autotrans-plants were studied following orthotopic reimplantation in the resulting mid-diaphyseal defect. Vascularized femur segments were isolated in 10 rabbits on their nutrient pedicle, and then replaced orthotopically with appropriate internal fixation. Postoperative weightbearing and mobility were unrestricted, and the contralateral femora served as no-treatment controls. After 16 weeks, the bone flaps were evaluated by x-ray (bone healing), mechanical testing (material properties), microangiography (quantification of intraosseous vasculature), histology (bone viability), and histomorphometry (bone remodeling). Bone healing occurred by 2 weeks, with further callus remodeling throughout the survival period. Eight transplants healed completely, while two had a distal pseudarthrosis. Microangiography demonstrated patent pedicles in all transplants. Intraosseous vessel densities were comparable to nonoperated (control) femora. We found ultimate strength and elastic modulus to be significantly reduced when compared to normal controls. Viable bone, increased mineral apposition rate, and bone turnover were demonstrated in all transplants. The method described, and the data provided will be of value for the further study of isolated segments of living bone, and in particular, for investigations of reconstruction of segmental bone loss in weight-bearing animal models. This study also provides important normative data on living autologous bone flap material properties, vascularity, and bone remodeling. We intend to use this method and data for comparison in subsequent studies of large bone vascularized allotransplantation. (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

However, it has reported some foreign body reactions over a long implantation period due to its slow bioresorbability. To further enhance its bioresorbability, we developed devices comprising a fibrous assembly of poly-L-lactide only three-dimensionally intertwined with particulate hydroxyapatite/poly-L-lactide composite. The biological behavior of the proposed material, provisionally referred to as complementarily reinforced composite (CRC), was compared with that of UDC in vivo. Cylindrical rods of UDC and CRC with 3.2-mm diameters were inserted bilaterally into the intramedullary distal femurs of 32 male Japanese white rabbits. Eight rabbits were euthanized at four, eight, 12, and 25 weeks after insertion. There were no significant differences between the mechanical properties of UDC and CRC over time. However, the results from histological analyses, surface characterization, radiological analyses, and push-out mechanical testing substantiated CRC's superior affinity to bone and enhanced bioactivity and bioresorbability in comparison with UDC. These characteristics were attributed to the dispersive marbling morphology produced by the CRC material's successive connectivity of u-HA particles throughout the PLLA matrix, which would accelerate PLLA hydrolysis degradation by H2O intrusion and enhance the bioactivity of u-HA particles exposed on the interface soon after implantation.

Although it is known that such an occurrence decreases the screw pull-out strength, the effect has not been quantified biomechanically. Materials and methods: Twenty fresh cadaveric lumbar vertebrae were harvested, and the bone mineral density (BMD) of each was evaluated with dual-energy radiography absorptiometry (DEXA). Twenty matched, 6.5-mm pedicle screws were inserted in two different manners in two groups, the control group and the experimental group. In the control group, the pedicle screw was inserted in a standard fashion taking adequate precaution to ensure there was no perforation of the wall. In the experimental group, the pedicle screw was inserted such that its trajectory perforated the lateral wall. Group assignments were done randomly, and the maximal fixation strength was recorded for each screw pull-out test with a material-testing system (MTS 858 II). Results: The average BMD for both groups was 0.850 g/cm(2) (0.788-0.912 g/cm(2)). The average (and standard deviation) maximal pull-out forces were 1,015.8 +/- 249.40 N for the experimental group and 1,326.0 +/- 320.50 N for the control group. According to a paired t-test, the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Conclusion: The results of this study confirm that the maximal pull-out strength of pedicle screws decreases by approximately 23.4% when the lateral wall is perforated.

Given their medical comorbidities and decreased bone mineral density, acetabular fractures in the elderly population present a significant challenge to the orthopaedic trauma surgeon. The anterior column posterior hemitransverse (ACPHT) fracture pattern is a common fracture pattern in this population, and is often associated with central subluxation/dislocation of the femoral head with articular impaction. This study sought to delineate the most stable fixation construct in ACPHT fracture patterns in the elderly population. Materials and methods: The sample consisted of 3 groups of synthetic hemipelves (N = 15), which were tested in order to compare stiffness by measuring motion at fracture lines under applied loads. The three groups of unique quadrilateral plate fixation were as follows: a specialty quadrilateral surface plate; 4 long peri- articular screws parallel to the quadrilateral surface into the ischium,; and an 8 hole infrapectineal buttress plate. Digital imaging system measured construct motion under load. Construct stiffness was estimated by linear regression of load between 50 and 850 N versus average relative motion (average of relative motion at 200 points along the line of the osteotomy). Permanent deformation was estimated as the magnitude of relative motion upon unloading. Results: Using ANOVA with Tukey's test to determine construct stiffness in loading, the group long periarticular screws was found to have significantly higher stiffness than either of the other groups. Maximal fracture displacement was located at the intersection of the low transverse fracture line in the posterior column and the free quadrilateral surface fragment. Conclusions: Results indicate that the best fixation construct for this ACPHT acetabular fracture pattern includes independent lag screws across the anterior column and a pelvic brim plate with long periarticular screws maximizing posterior column fixation and preventing medialization of the free quadrilateral fragment. Although there are potential patient considerations that may complicate the placement of all 4 long screws, in most patients one or more of these screws can be safely placed in order to help prevent secondary displacement.

Outcome of anatomic locking plate in extraarticular distal humeral shaft fractures	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Anatomic plate; distal humerus; extraarticular; humeral fracture; posterolateral plate	DIAPHYSEAL FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; 3RD	Background: Extraarticular fractures of distal humerus are challenging injuries to treat because of complex anatomy and fracture patterns. Functional bracing may not provide adequate stability in these injuries and operative treatment with intramedullary nails or conventional plates also has the limitation of inadequate fixation in the short distal fragment. The 3.5 mm precontoured single column locking plate (extraarticular distal humerus plate [EADHP]) has been introduced to overcome this problem. We evaluated the clinical and functional outcomes of treating these fractures with the EADHP. Materials and Methods: 26 patients with extraarticular fractures of distal humerus presenting within 3 weeks of injury between January 2012 and June 2015, were included in this prospective study. Open IIIB and IIIC fractures, nonunions, or those with a history of previous infection in the arm were excluded. Operative fixation was done using the EADHP in all the cases. The time for union, range of motion at shoulder and elbow and secondary procedures were recorded in followup. The shoulder and elbow function was assessed using the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder scale and Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) respectively. Results: There were 21 males and 5 females with mean age of 37.3 years (range 18-72 years). Twenty two (84.6%) cases had complex fracture patterns (AO/OTA Type 12-B and C). The mean time to fracture union was 22.4 weeks (range 16-28 weeks). The mean followup time was 11.6 months, (range 4-24 months). Four patients (15.4%) had failure of cortical screws in the proximal fracture fragment, of which two required revision fixation with bone grafting. Another nonunion was seen following a surgical site infection, which healed after wound lavage and bone grafting. The MEPS (average: 96.1; range 80-100) was excellent in 81% cases (n = 21) and good in 19% cases (n = 5). UCLA score (average: 33.5; range 25-35) was good/excellent in 88.5% cases (n = 23) and fair in 11.5% cases (n = 3). Conclusion: EADHP is a reliable option in treating extraarticular distal humeral fractures as it provides stable fixation with an early return to function.

Complication Rate Comparing Variable Angle Distal Locking Plate to Fixed Angle Plate Fixation of Distal Radius Fractures	ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY			English	Article						distal radius fractures; complication; safety; variable angle; fixed angle	VOLAR PLATE; UNSTABLE FRACTURES	Background: Distal radius fractures are common, accounting for approximately 18% of all fractures in adults. Operative management is common, and there are numerous variants of plates used. However, data on safety and complication rates for different plates are limited. Objective: To determine whether the rate of complications differed between two distinct types of volar plate design for distal radius fracture fixation, one using predetermined fixed angles for the locking screws or pegs and the other using a variable angle locking design for the locking screws or pegs. Our null hypothesis was that the rate of complications would be the same in each group. Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients with unstable distal radius fractures treated operatively between 2008 and 2011. Patients treated with external fixation or small fragment plates were excluded; all remaining patients underwent internal fixation with 1 of 3 plate designs: Stryker Universal Distal Radius Plate, Acumed Acu-Loc, or Trimed Volar Bearing Plate. Results: A total of 189 patients underwent surgical treatment for an unstable distal radius fracture with a volar plate. Fixed angle plates were used in 60 patients and polyaxial locking plates using a rotatable bearing were used in 148 patients. In the fixed angle plate group, 11 required a second operation on the affected limb for a total of 18 procedures. In 7 of 11 patients, secondary surgery was directly related to complications from the hardware (symptomatic hardware, loose hardware and tendon rupture). All 7 of these patients were in the fixed angle plate group, for a rate of hardware related complications of 12% (7/60). No hardware related complications occurred in patients in the group treated with a polyaxial locking plate (0/129). The complication rate in the fixed angle plate group is significantly different than 0, the rate observed in the polyaxial locking plate group (z score = 3.95, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Our data suggest that treatment of unstable distal radius fractures with a volar bearing variable angle plate fixation is safe and effective. In our series, there was a significant reduction in the rate of hardware-related complications with the polyaxial locking plate as compared with a fixed angle plate.

J	Barger, K; Robinson, M				Barger, Kurt; Robinson, Matthew			An evaluation of the inlet obturator oblique view for sacroiliac and transsacral screw placement	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Fluoroscopy; Inlet obturator oblique view; Sacroiliac screw; Transsacral screw; Pelvis; Posterior pelvic ring fixation	FIXATION; FRACTURES	Introduction Between 2005 and 2017, the number of closed reduction and internal fixation of pelvic ring injuries increased by 1116%. Percutaneous fixation is currently the only minimally invasive technique that can stabilize the posterior elements of the pelvis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the utility of the inlet obturator oblique view (IOO) with the hypothesis that the IOO view will improve the accuracy of sacroiliac and transsacral screw placement in the S1 or S2 body and improve the accuracy of assessing whether the implant is fully seated against the outer cortex of the ilium. Materials and methods Ten male pelvic training models were used. Thirty-six screw configurations were inserted by a fellowship trained orthopedic trauma surgeon in appropriately and inappropriately placed sacroiliac and transsacral screw configurations. These configurations were imaged using fluoroscopy in different planes and saved for survey. Results Fourteen orthopedic professionals reviewed 313 fluoroscopic images. Interrater reliability demonstrated marked improvement in assessment of whether the screw head was seated against the outer cortex of the ilium with the IOO view (kappa = 0.841, without IOO kappa = 0.027). There was a statistically significant difference in overall accuracy (p value < 0.001, OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.35-1.84) and whether the screw head was seated (p value < 0.001, OR = 8.14, 95% CI = 5.52-11.99) when compared with and without the IOO view (accuracy with IOO view: 85%, accuracy without IOO view: 78.26%; screw seated with IOO view: 93.93%, screw seated without IOO view: 65.54%). There was no significant difference (p value 0.465, OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.82-1.55) determining if the screw was in a safe position (safe with IOO view: 84.64%, safe without IOO view: 83.04%). Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that misinterpretation of sacroiliac and transsacral screw placement can occur with the standard fluoroscopic imaging. We suggest the addition of the IOO view increases the overall accuracy of screw placement and whether the screw head is fully seated against the outer table of the ilium. This in turn can improve fixation and potentially improve patient outcomes and decrease adverse events.

Materials and Methods: Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to compare the biomechanical properties between PCSF and RPSF. CT scan data of one PSD patient were used for three-dimensional reconstructions. After a validated pelvic finite element model was established, both PCSF and RPSF were simulated, and a vertical downward load of 600 N was loaded. The distance of pubic symphysis and stress were tested. Then, 51 Tile type B1 PSD patients (24 in the PCSF group; 27 in the RPSF group) were reviewed. Intra-operative blood loss, operative time, and the length of the skin scar were recorded. The distance of pubic symphysis was measured, and complications of infection, implant failure, and revision surgery were recorded. The Majeed scoring system was also evaluated. Results: The maximum displacement of the pubic symphysis was 0.408 and 0.643 mm in the RPSF and PCSF models, respectively. The maximum stress of the plate in RPSF was 1846 MPa and that of the cannulated screw in PCSF was 30.92 MPa. All 51 patients received follow-up at least 18 months post-surgery (range 18-54 months). Intra-operative blood loss, operative time, and the length of the skin scar in the PCSF group were significantly different than those in the RPSF group. No significant differences were found in wound infection, implant failure, rate of revision surgery, distance of pubic symphysis, and Majeed score. Conclusion: PCSF can provide comparable biomechanical properties to RPSF in the treatment of Tile B1 type PSD. Meanwhile, PCSF and RPSF have similar clinical and radiographic outcomes. Furthermore, PCSF also has the advantages of being minimally invasive, has less blood loss, and has shorter operative time and skin scar.

The use of computer navigation in performing minimally invasive surgery for intertrochanteric hip fractures - The experience in Singapore	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						minimally invasive; hip fracture; dynamic hip screw; computer navigation	BIOMECHANICAL ANALYSIS; INTERNAL-FIXATION; SCREW	Objective: Intertrochanteric hip fractures are very common and early mobilisation correlates with a better outcome. The ideal surgical procedure should protect the soft tissue envelope, thereby preserving blood supply and reducing blood loss. Furthermore, occupational exposure to fluoroscopy that is used in hip fracture fixation remains a concern amongst orthopaedic surgeons. Computer-aided surgery can help to reduce reliance on fluoroscopy. We therefore combined the principles of minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) and computer navigation to describe a new procedure. We also present our results using this technique of minimally invasive computer-navigated dynamic hip screw fixation (navMIS-DHS), and compare it to computer-navigated open DHS fixation (nav-DHS) and to conventional open DHS fixation (conv-DHS). Materials and methods: This paper has three parts. In the first part, we describe the procedure of navMIS-DHS in detail. In the second part, we present our initial retrospective pilot series of 35 cases. Amongst them we performed 5 navMIS-DHS, 3 nav-DHS and 27 conv-DHS. There were also two cases of cony-DHS deliberately performed with a mini-incision in an attempt to see if we could duplicate the 5 cm incision that we achieved with navMIS-DHS. All patients were followed up for a minimum of 6 months. In the third part, we performed a single surgeon prospective evaluation of navMIS-DHS versus conv-DHS involving 43 fractures in two arms. Results: We were able to achieve reduction in fluoroscopy time. There was also reduction in opiate requirement post-operatively in the minimally invasive procedure. The incision sizes were also smaller. The prospective study also showed less wound-related complications in navMIS-DHS and a shorter time to ambulation. Implant positions were acceptable but we have also described how it may be improved. Conclusions: Navigated MIS-DHS, by virtue of less pain, better healing, earlier rehabilitation and potentially shorter hospital stay, would benefit both the patients and reduce the economic strain on the health care system. It is a safe and reproducible procedure. Technical difficulties are present and these need to be addressed with further modifications of technique, and instrumentation. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy with a secure bone allograft (Osteopure™) and locked plate fixation: Retrospective clinical and radiological evaluation of 69 knees after 7.5 years follow-up	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Medial opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy; Bone allograft; Outcomes	MEDIAL COMPARTMENT OSTEOARTHRITIS; DONOR SITE MORBIDITY; CLOSING-WEDGE; ILIAC CREST; WEIGHT-BEARING; ANTERIOR; OUTCOMES; COMPLICATIONS; SURVIVAL; GRAFTS	BACKGROUND: Medial opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy (OWHTO) provides reliable and long-lasting benefits, despite the wide range of wedge-filling and internal-fixation techniques used. The purpose of this work was to assess the clinical and radiological outcomes in a case-series of OWHTO performed using a secure bone allograft and locked plate fixation. HYPOTHESIS: The clinical and radiological outcomes of OWHTO with a high-safety bone allograft and locked plate fixation are similar to those reported in previous case-series studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-centre retrospective design was used to study 69 knees in 64 patients with a mean age of 51.8years (31-53years) and a preoperative hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle of 173 degrees (165 degrees-180 degrees). The wedge was filled with secure Osteopure bone allograft and fixation was achieved using an Integra Surfixlocked plate. Mean follow-up was 7.5years (5-9.3years). Clinical and functional outcomes were assessed by determining the IKS and KOOS-PS scores and recording complications related or unrelated to the allograft. The main criterion for assessing OWHTO survival was the time to revision surgery for symptom recurrence. Radiological assessment criteria were the HKA angle, tibial slope, patellar height, and osteoarthritis grade. GESTO criteria were used to evaluate the behaviour of the allograft. RESULTS: Of the 69 knees, 64 (92.8%) were re-evaluated. The survival rate after 9.3years was 95%+/- 2.7% (3 failures managed with arthroplasty). The functional IKS score improved significantly, by 20 points (P<0.001). Mean increases of 7.8 degrees for the HKA angle and 3.5 degrees for tibial slope were recorded. Bone healing without radiological abnormalities was consistently achieved within 6months. There were no complications related to the allograft (infections, allergies; local or systemic toxicity). DISCUSSION: The clinical, radiological, and safety outcomes documented in our study were similar to those reported in earlier work. Copyright (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Critical analysis of olecranon fracture management by pre-contoured locking plates	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Fracture of the ulna; Internal fixation; Pre-contoured plate; Locking plate	PROXIMAL ULNA; COMMINUTED FRACTURES; FIXATION; ELBOW; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; LCP	Background: Fractures of the proximal ulna are rare and usually managed surgically. Strong fixation of the harware is essential to obtain good outcomes. We report our experience with pre-contoured locking plate fixation of complex olecranon fractures and present a critical appraisal of the outcomes. Hypothesis: Pre-contoured locking plates provide good outcomes, but their clinical tolerance may be limited in some instances. Materials and methods: From September 2009 to December 2011, 28 patients were managed using a pre-contoured locking compression plate (LCP). Among them, 6 were excluded because of missing data, which left 22 patients (11 males and 11 females) with a mean age of 55.7 years, including 12 who were employed. The fracture was on the dominant side in 11 patients. According to the Mayo Clinic classification, 15 fractures were type II and 7 type III. In addition to the ulnar fracture, a radial head fracture was present in 9 patients and a coronoid process fracture in 5 patients. Functional recovery was assessed using the Broberg-Morrey score and Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS). Radiographs were obtained to evaluate the quality of fracture reduction and fracture healing, as well as to look for ossifications and osteoarthritis. Results: Mean follow-up was 20 months. Flexion was 131 degrees, extension loss was 9.5 degrees, pronation was 79 degrees, and supination was 80.5 degrees. The mean Broberg-Morrey score was 96.7 and the mean MEPS score 96.6. Fracture healing occurred in all patients, within a mean of 10.6 weeks. Evidence of early osteoarthritis was found in 6 patients, ossifications in 3 patients, and synostosis in 1 patient. An infection was successfully treated with lavage and antibiotic therapy in 1 patient. The fixation hardware was removed in 6 patients. No prognostic factors were identified. Discussion-conclusion: Our hypothesis was confirmed. The outcomes are encouraging and comparable to those reported in the literature. The critical issue is the limited clinical tolerance of the plate with a high rate of posterior impingement requiring plate removal (27%). Rigorous technique is essential during plate implantation.

J	Lin, DS; Zuo, SJ; Li, L; Wang, L; Lian, KJ				Lin, Dasheng; Zuo, Shenjia; Li, Lin; Wang, Lei; Lian, Kejian			Treatment of neglected femoral neck fractures using the modified dynamic hip screw with autogenous bone and bone morphogenetic protein-2 composite materials grafting	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Bone graft; dynamic hip screw; femoral neck fractures; fixation; bone morphogenic protein	INTERNAL-FIXATION	Background: The neglected femoral neck fracture is one where there has been a delay of more than 30 days to seek medical help from the time of the original injury. Salvage procedures, such as osteotomy and other treatment options such as vascularized and nonvascularized bone grafts have high failure rates and arthroplasty procedures are not ideal, given the patient's young age and higher levels of activity. We designed a hollow bone graft dynamic hip screw (Hb-DHS) (modified DHS, Hb-DHS) for use in neglected femoral neck fractures. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of the modified dynamic hip screw (DHS) with autogenous bone and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) composite materials grafting for the treatment of the neglected femoral neck fractures. Materials and Methods: A prospective study was carried out in twenty patients of neglected femoral neck fractures treated with the modified DHS with autogenous bone and BMP-2 composite materials grafting between July 2007 and February 2010. There were 14 men and 6 women with a mean age of 29.6 years (range 19-42 years). The mean time from injury to surgery was 9.7 weeks (range 6-16 weeks). The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, fracture healing time, Harris scoring for hip function and complications were recorded to evaluate treatment effects. Results: The mean operation time was 75.8 min (range 55-100 min) with mean intraoperative blood loss volume of 105 mL (range 70-220 mL). The mean time to union was 17 weeks (range 12-24 weeks). One patient did not achieve union, and two patients had avascular necrosis of the femoral head. This patient with nonunion underwent intertrochanteric osteotomy. In patients with avascular necrosis one required total hip arthroplasty, the other did not require intervention at the last followup. A total of 14 patients (70%) had excellent results, 2 (10%) had good, 1 (5%) had moderate and 3 (15%) had poor results. Conclusion: The modified DHS with autogenous bone and BMP-2 composite materials grafting for the treatment of neglected femoral neck fractures was effective and had less complications.

The literature has reported acceptable and unacceptable hardware removal rates in localized populations. Materials and Methods: The 2007 Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to determine all plate removal procedures associated with common complications from facial reductions. Statistical analysis was used to compare the differences in demographics of the reduction procedure and removal procedure groups. Results: Some form of open fixation was reported in 4,879 patients. Plate removals associated with complications were reported in 246 patients. The "failure" removal rate as a percentage of the total number of open procedures for the year was 5.0%. Gender, race, age, primary payer, and median income of the patient were determined to significantly affect the likelihood for hardware removal due to complications. Conclusion: These results suggest that decreased lower bone quality and ability to pay affect the chances that a particular patient will undergo a hardware removal procedure. There is a strong possibility that the reported removal rate underestimates the actual failure rate of the procedures and devices used to treat facial trauma.

Indications Peri- and interprosthetic distal femur fractures with limited (periprosthetic) bone stock in geriatric patients. Re-operations (delayed and non-unions; infected non-unions) of the distal femur. Distal femoral fractures or femoral shaft fractures that do not qualify for femoral nailing and where the patient is unable to comply with weight-bearing restrictions. Contraindications Peri- and interprosthetic femoral fractures with unstable knee prosthesis and local soft tissue infection. Peri- and interprosthetic fractures of the proximal femur. Surgical technique Supine position on a radiolucent table with both legs draped free. Support the knee to release traction on the distal fragment by the gastrocnemius muscle. Reduction and fixation of the fracture using a minimally invasive lateral approach. To reduce stress riser zones in interprosthetic fractures, the fixation device should overlap both the prosthesis by at least twice the diameter of the femoral diaphysis. Control plate position and reduction with special emphasis on length, rotation and longitudinal axes, using the healthy side as a reference. After sufficient reduction and fixation of the fracture, one proceeds to the medial plate fixation of the femur. Pre- or intraoperative contouring of a narrow large fragment locking compression plate into a helical shaped plate should be performed, using bending irons and a saw bone of a standard femur. The helical shaped plate is introduced submuscular and epiperiosteal in a minimally invasive fashion and fixed with bicortical locking screws. Postoperative management Unrestricted weight bearing with walker or crutches under supervision of physiotherapist. Results Between 2015 and December 2018, minimally invasive double-plate osteosynthesis using a medial helical shaped plate was performed in 11 patients. In 6 cases it was applied in patients (81 years & x202f;+/- 7 SD) with a supracondylar peri- or interprosthetic femoral fracture. No implant failure or loss of reduction was seen after postoperative unrestricted weight bearing. In the additional 5 cases double-plating was used in salvage procedures ([infected] non-unions, hardware failure). One of these patients developed a fracture-related infection for which all material was removed. The fracture healed after a new attempt of antegrade nailing combined with an additional locking plate. In the remaining patients complete bone healing without hardware failure was seen.

Parametric study of radial functionally graded femoral prostheses with different geometries	MECCANICA			English	Article						Functionally graded materials; Finite element analysis; Femoral prosthesis; Stress shielding; Strain energy density; Interface stress	FINITE-ELEMENT-ANALYSIS; FATIGUE BEHAVIOR; HIP-PROSTHESIS; DESIGN; STEM; OPTIMIZATION; JOINT; FABRICATION; FIXATION; PLATES	Due to complex loading and chemical conditions of the human body, the artificial replacements of the body organs demand materials with superior characteristics. Therefore, recently using composite materials have gained a lot of popularity for this purpose. As a special case of the composite materials, functionally graded materials (FGMs) exhibit very interesting behavior that makes them a very suitable candidate where this study is aimed to examine the performance of femoral prostheses made of a FGM. The internal and external layers of the prostheses were composed of stainless steel and hydroxyapatite, respectively. The finite element method was used to compute the strain energy density in the proximal metaphysis of the bone, von Mises stress over the femoral prostheses, and maximum and minimum principal stress developed in the bone. The results revealed dependency of the strain energy density, interface stresses, and implanted femur component stresses on the gradient index and geometrical properties of the prostheses. Moreover, among the geometrical factors, profile and proximal cross-section were the key factors to alter strain energy density, whereas the distal cross-section effect was minor. Besides, changes in interface stresses were related to all geometrical properties of prostheses. However, stress changes in prosthesis and bone were less evident under the influence of prosthesis geometrical properties, while strains in bone showed a significant dependency to the gradient index and geometrical properties of the prosthesis.

PEMTC (2-(prop-2-enamido)ethyl N-{3-[({[2-ethyl-3-hydroxy-2(hydroxymethyl)propoxy]carbonyl}amino)methyl]-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexyl}carbamate) contains hydrogen bond active site and light-initiated C=C. We introduced it as a branch chain block into poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL). By feeding and monitoring the reaction process, we synthesized a large number of polyurethane elastomers, hydrogen bonds PCL-based elastomer (HPE), which contain a large number of dynamic hydrogen bonds. Under UV irradiation, PEMTC can make HPE molecules aggregate and cross-link, improve the degree of internal hydrogen bonding interaction of HPE materials and endow HPE materials with good elasticity, toughness, heat resistance and shape memory ability. After 270 nm UV irradiation, the elongation at break of HPE materials decreased from 607.14-1463.95% to 426.60-610.36%, but the strength at break of HPE materials increased from 3.36-13.52 to 10.28-41.52 MPa, and the toughness increased from 16.36-129.71 to 40.48-172.22 MJ m(-3). In addition, the highest shape fixation rate of HPE after UV irradiation was 98.0%, and the recovery rate was 93.7%.

ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						humeral fractures; intramedullary nailing; internal fixation; functional result; isometric strength	ROTATOR CUFF; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; EXPERIENCE; VASCULARITY; REPAIR	Introduction: Antegrade intramedullary (IM) nailing of humeral shaft fractures is reported to cause shoulder joint impairment. This retrospective study compared shoulder joint symptoms, range of motion (ROM), and isometric strength after antegrade IM nailing and dynamic compression (DC) plating of humeral shaft fractures. Materials and methods: We compared 29 patients with DC plating and 44 with antegrade IM nailing of their humeral shaft fractures. Shoulder pain, L'Insalata and Constant scores, shoulder joint ROM and isometric shoulder strengths were measured after mean follow-up of 6.2 (1-15) years (DC plating) and 5.5 (2-10) years (IM nailing). Results: Patients had nonsignificantly more shoulder pain after IM nailing than after DC plating. Shoulder scores and isometric strength measurements showed no difference between the groups. Flexion was significantly better after DC plating, but none of the other ROM parameters differed between the groups. The shoulder scores and all ROM and strength parameters of the injured side were significantly lower than on the uninjured side in both groups. Conclusions: Shoulder joint ROM and strength does not recover to normal after humeral shaft fracture. Antegrade IM nailing if performed properly is not responsible for shoulder joint impairment.

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND EMERGENCY SURGERY			English	Article						fractures of the proximal femur; femoral fractures; hip fracture; implants for osteosynthesis	INTERNAL-FIXATION; DISPLACED FRACTURES; METAANALYSIS	Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine whether the fixation device known as the dynamic Martin screw (DMS) offers a reasonable alternative for stabilizing intracapsular femoral neck fractures. Materials and Methods: A total of 63 patients with intracapsular femoral neck fractures, stabilized between 1993 and 1997 with the DMS, were followed up in this retrospective study in both 1999 and 2002. The patients were on average 64 years of age, with 30 younger and 33 older than 65. The main outcome measurements consisted of union, non-union, aseptic osteonecrosis of the femoral head and implant failure. Results: We determined an overall osteonecrosis rate of 19% (12 of 63) for our patient group after an observation period on average of 83 months. The osteonecrosis rate for undisplaced fractures was 13.2% (5 of 38), and 28% (7 of 25) for displaced fractures. Non-union occurred in 4.8% (3 of 63) and union in 95.2% (60 of 63) of the patient cases. An implant-associated complication involving deep infection occurred in one case, but no example of implant breakage was recorded. Conclusions: As a method for stabilizing intracapsular femoral neck fractures, the DMS provides treatment results comparable to other sliding hip screws or cannulated screw.

J	Kelly, CM; Wilkins, RM				Kelly, CM; Wilkins, RM			Treatment of benign bone lesions with an injectable calcium sulfate-based bone graft substitute	ORTHOPEDICS			English	Article							ILIAC BONE; DONOR-SITE; FRACTURE; REMOVAL; MATRIX	The treatment of benign bone lesions can be challenging due to the limited quantity of autogenous graft available for harvest and grafting of the defect. The use of an injectable calcium sulfate bone graft substitute, Minimally-Invasive Injectable Graft (MIIG) (Wright Medical Technology, Inc, Arlington, Tenn), material for treatment of these bone lesions is advantageous. Calcium sulfate has a long-standing history in the treatment of bone voids secondary to trauma, infection, or neoplastic processes. Minimally-Invasive Injectable Graft injectable calcium sulfate graft may be injected into surgically created osseous defects or bone defects secondary to traumatic, injury. After hardening, the paste acts as a temporary intraosseous support through which internal fixation may be placed. Fifteen patients with benign space-occupying lesions were treated with curettage and grafting with an injectable, surgical-grade, calcium sulfate bone graft substitute. Bone healing was assessed postoperatively and defined as resorption of the bone graft substitute material and replacement with new bone formation. The grafted defects in 14 of the 15 patients showed complete incorporation of the graft material at an average of 8 weeks. One patient required incision and drainage for a deep infection 5 weeks postoperatively. The average follow-up was 6 months (range: 3-15 months), and Musculoskeletal Tumor Society functional outcome scores averaged 83%. This injectable, minimally invasive graft material is easy to use, provides a temporary structural support when grafting bone defects, and results in predictable rapid bone healing.

Pre- and postoperative complications of adult forearm fractures treated with plate fixation	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Forearm fracture; Complications; Neurological disorders; Nonunion; Synostosis; Iterative fractures	DYNAMIC COMPRESSION PLATE; DIAPHYSEAL FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; RADIOULNAR SYNOSTOSIS; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; BONES; MANAGEMENT; REFRACTURE; REMOVAL	Introduction: Adult forearm fractures account for 1-2% of all fractures of the limbs. The main objective of this retrospective multicenter study was to evaluate pre- and postoperative complications of forearm fractures. The secondary objective was to evaluate functional and radiological results of plate osteosynthesis for these fractures. Material and methods: Between January 2008 and March 2014, 131 forearm fractures were reviewed retrospectively. Fractures were classified preoperatively according to the AO classification. Clinical outcomes were classified into four categories according to the Tschnerne and Oestern classification. Pre- and postoperative complications were sought systematically. Results: Before surgery, 12 patients had neurological impairment (9%). At the last follow-up, nine patients had persistent neurological disorders (6.9%). Union of forearm fractures was obtained in 122 patients at 4.6 months on average (+/- 2.6). Nine patients with nonunion were observed (6.9%) and five patients had radioulnar synostosis (3.8%). Discussion: The frequency of neurological complications concomitant to forearm fractures is noteworthy. Similar cases with essentially irritative neurological disease have been reported in the literature, in particular for the ulnar nerve. Fracture nonunion is a relatively common complication: between 2 and 10% of cases depending on the study. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) has been shown to induce bone formation and union in long bone defects and nonunions. There are, however, no previous reports of BMP being used for ulnar nonunions. We report on five cases of resistant ulnar nonunions treated with a composite implant consisting of a biocoral frame, collagen carrier, and bovine BMP. Materials and methods. Four diaphyseal and one olecranon ulnar nonunions were treated using BMP/coral implant combined with internal fixation. Additional autografting was used in three cases. All of the cases were challenging in their own ways: Three of the patients had been operated on earlier for their nonunion without success, one had a 40 mm bone loss, and one had a 9-month-old untreated olecranon fracture. After excision of the sclerotic surfaces of the nonunion, the gap was filled with autograft and a composite implant containing BMP. Fixation was done with a compression plate in the diaphyseal nonunions and with a tension band in the olecranon nonunion. Results. Solid union was achieved in all five cases. No infections or other adverse effects were encountered. Conclusion. These preliminary results suggest that BMP-containing implants might be a feasible alternative or superior to autografting in the treatment of resistant ulnar nonunions.

J	Biçici, V; Bingöl, I				Bicici, Vedat; Bingol, Izzet			Do different surgical techniques in tibia pilon fractures change the results of the midterm?	TURKISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Pilon fracture; distal tibia; external fixation; Ilizarov external fixator; AOFAS	INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; INFECTION	Background/aim: Pilon fracture is difficult to treat fractures due to many complications that can develop after surgery. To achieve the best results, different surgical approaches are used.In our study, we aimed to compare the functional results and complication rates of our treatments in patients treated with 3 different surgical tecniques. Materials and methods: 89 pilon fractures of 87 patients treated for pilon fracture were evaluated. Patients were examined in 3 different groups (one step, two step surgery and Ilizarov). Functional results, postoperative complications and ankle AOFAS scores were evaluated. Results: The mean AOFAS score of the all patients was 77.67. There was no significant difference between 3 surgical techniques (P = 0,880). While skin complication was not seen in patients who underwent double-stage surgery and Ilizarov (0%); It was seen in 6 (15.7%) patients who underwent single-stage surgery. Treatment results were found to be better in type 1 and type 2 fractures, while in type 3 fractures (P = 0.004). Conclusion: Despite the different surgical approaches and implants applied, no difference was found between the midterm ankle functional results of the patients. Two-stage surgery and Ilizarov is a safe and effective treatment approach to reduce morbidity and early complications in pilon fractures.

YONSEI MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Intertrochanteric fracture; femoral neck shortening; lag screw sliding	INTERTROCHANTERIC HIP-FRACTURES; GAMMA-NAIL; PERITROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; SCREW; INTRAMEDULLARY; FEMUR; COMPRESSION; FAILURE	Purpose: Presence of a cephalomedullary nail (CMN) in the medullary canal has been thought as advantageous in the control of femoral neck shortening (FNS) and lag screw sliding in trochanteric fracture compared to extramedullary fixation system. However, researches on the factors that influence the degree of FNS after cephalomedullary nailing are lacking. Materials and Methods: We observed 95" % patients (mean age, 75 +/- 2.8 years) with trochanteric fractures who were treated with a CMN, and evaluated the relationship between FNS and patient factors including age, gender, fracture type (AO/OTA), bone mineral density, medullary canal diameter, canal occupancy ratio (COR=nail size/canal diameter), and tip-apex distance using initial, immediate postoperative, and follow-up radiography. Results: Univariate regression analyses revealed that the degree of FNS was significantly correlated with fracture type (Al versus A3, p<0.001), medullary canal diameter (p<0.001), and CUR (p<0.001). Multiple regression analyses revealed that FNS was strongly correlated with fracture type (p<0.001) and CUR (p<0.001). Conclusion: Presence of a CMN in the medullary canal could not effectively prevent FNS in patients with low CUR and in A3 type fracture.

J	Pietrzak, WS				Pietrzak, William S.			Rapid cooling through the glass transition transiently increases ductility of PGA/PLLA copolymers: a proposed mechanism and implications for devices	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							BIODEGRADABLE POLYMERS; DEGRADATION RATE; SCREW FIXATION; PLATE; EXPERIENCE; SCAFFOLDS; IMPLANTS; FILMS	Heating bioabsorbable plates above T-g allows for temporary softening to facilitate adaptation to bone. This can, however, transiently alter the mechanical properties, a better understanding of which would provide further insight into the use of these polymers. Two types of unoriented L-lactide/glycolide copolymer wafer specimens ( 82: 18 and 95: 5 molar ratios) were heated to 90 degrees C, cooled at various rates, and mechanically tested ( three-point bend). Long coolingtimes(similar to 8 h) did not change mechanical properties compared to unheated controls, whereas faster cooling rates resulted in increased ductility (50-200% increase in energy to break and peak deformation), however, there was gradual recovery. Under simulated physiological incubation conditions ( pH 7.4 buffer, 37 degrees C) partial recovery occurred within 48 h. These results fit well into the theoretical framework of free volume considerations. Following rapid cooling to below Tg, the polymer is not initially at equilibrium, containing excess free volume that contributes to increased molecular mobility and ductile behavior. As equilibrium is approached, free volume decreases and the material behaves as a glassy solid. While there is little clinical consequence as regards internal fixation devices, possible transient changes in permeability and other properties could have implications in drug delivery and other applications.

J	Patino, JM				Martin Patino, Juan			Treatment of humeral shaft fractures using antegrade nailing: functional outcome in the shoulder	JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY			English	Article						Shoulder; shoulder function; humeral shaft fractures; fracture fixation; antegrade nailing	DYNAMIC COMPRESSION PLATE; INTRAMEDULLARY NAIL; COMPLICATIONS; FIXATION	Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate shoulder outcomes and function after humeral shaft fractures treated with antegrade nailing. Materials and methods: Thirty patients with acute humeral shaft fractures who underwent antegrade locked intramedullary nailing were retrospectively studied. Range of motion (ROM) of the affected shoulder was evaluated, comparing it with the nonaffected shoulder, radiologic position of the nails, complications, and need for a second surgery. Results: The study enrolled 20 men and 10 women (average age, 41.9 years). The average follow-up was 35.8 months. The average shoulder elevation averaged 157 degrees, internal rotation was variable (reaching the sacroiliac joint to T7), and external rotation averaged 75 degrees. Elbow flexion-extension ROM averaged 133 degrees (115 degrees - 145 degrees). According to the Rodriguez-Merchan criteria, 12 patients achieved excellent results (40%), 7 good (20%), and 6 fair (23.3%); poor results were found in 5 cases (16.6%). Twelve patients achieved full mobility of the shoulder, whereas 18 had some loss of motion, with significant differences between the affected and nonaffected shoulders (P = .001). Conclusion: Decreased shoulder ROM is common after antegrade nailing of humeral shaft fractures. Avoidance of nail impingement can improve final outcomes.

In vitro degradation of poly-L-D-lactic acid (PLDLA) pellets and powder used as synthetic alloplasts for bone grafting	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							BIODEGRADABLE POLYMERS; INTERNAL-FIXATION; FRACTURES; PLATES; REPAIR; SCREWS; VIVO	The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro degradation of pellet and powder forms of a polyL-D-lactic acid material used to produce plates and screws for orthopedic, oral, and maxillofacial applications. Materials and methods In order to produce the powder form the as-received pellets were milled in a cryogenic chamber. Particles size distribution (PSD) histograms were developed for both forms. The materials were then characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) before and after immersion in simulated body fluid for 30, 60, and 90 days. Results SEM showed that for both forms material degradation started after 30 days of immersion in SBF and evolved until 90 days. Degradation started at the amorphous zones of the polymer and exposed of deeper crystalline layers. The pellet and powder samples PSD showed polydispersed patterns with mean diameters of 673.98 mu m and 259.55 mu m. Thermal onset degradation temperatures were 365.64 degrees C and 360.30 degrees C, and of 363.49 degrees C and 359.83 degrees C before immersion and after 90 days in SBF for the pellet and powder forms, respectively. The Tg's of the pellets and the powder were approximately 61.5 degrees C and 66 degrees C, and their respective endothermic peaks were observed at approximately 125 degrees C and 120 degrees C. The specific heat (c) was approximately 8.5 J/g and 6.2 J/g for the pellet and powder material, respectively. Conclusion According to the results obtained, cryogenic milling resulted in particle plastic deformation, and alterations in glass transition temperature, melting temperature, and specific heat of the material.

Methods: Cerec3 PCCs of three different preparation designs (n = 20) were fabricated according to the following: Group I-conventional. functional cusp capping/shoulder preparation, Group II-horizontal reduction of cusps and Group Ill-complete reduction of cusps/shoulder preparation. After fixation of PCCs, the mu CT scanning was performed. For obtaining the average internal gap (AIG), the mu CT sections were reconstructed 3-dimensionally, and then the total volume of the internal gap was divided by the contact surface area. The 2-dimensional (2D) mu CT views were used to investigate the gaps at predetermined key positions in seven bucco-lingual sections and three mesio-distal cross sections. The gaps were measured using the mu CT at each reference point. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's test. Results: For the 3D reconstruction technique, the AIGs were as followed: Group 1 197.3 +/- 48.2 mu m, Group II 171.2 +/- 45.1 mu m, and Group III 152.7 +/- 27.1 mu m. For the 2D mu CT views, the gaps of each group were the smallest on the margins ranging from 35.4 +/- 32.2 to 128.4 +/- 69.5 mu m, and the largest on the horizontal or angle walls ranging from 184.5 +/- 41.2 to 406.5 +/- 176.1 mu m. According to the results, Group I showed larger marginal and internal gaps compared with the other groups. Conclusions: For the PCCs, the simplified designs (Groups II and III) demonstrated superior results compared to the traditional cusp capping design (Group I). The marginal gaps were smaller than the internal gaps in all groups. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: The external and internal diameters and wall thicknesses of the facial artery and its branches were measured from 41 formalin-embalmed cadavers after removing connective tissues attached to the arterial wall. Results: The diameter and thickness of the facial artery exhibited significant interregional differences. The external and internal diameters of the facial artery were 1.9 +/- 0.4 and 1.2 +/- 0.3 mm (mean +/- SD), respectively, at the inferior border of the mandible; 1.7 +/- 0.3 and 1.2 +/- 0.3 mm in the vicinity of the inferior labial artery; 1.5 +/- 0.3 and 1.0 +/- 0.3 mm at the mouth corner; 1.4 +/- 0.3 and 0.9 +/- 0.2 mm in the vicinity of the superior labial artery; and 1.1 +/- 0.2 and 0.7 +/- 0.2 mm in the vicinity of the lateral nasal artery. The external and internal diameters at the proximal parts of the inferior labial artery, superior labial artery, and lateral nasal artery were 1.0 +/- 0.3 and 0.6 +/- 0.2 mm, 0.9 +/- 0.3 and 0.6 +/- 0.2 mm, and 0.8 +/- 0.2 and 0.5 +/- 0.2 mm, respectively. Conclusion: Morphometric examinations of the facial artery under stereomicroscope observation as performed in the present study are expected to be more accurate than direct measurements obtained during cadaveric dissection or conventional histologic evaluations.

Detection and identification of mycobacteria in fixed stained smears and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues using PCR	JOURNAL OF SMALL ANIMAL PRACTICE			English	Article							POLYMERASE-CHAIN-REACTION; CANINE LEPROID GRANULOMA; FELINE LEPROSY; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; ULCERANS INFECTION; MARINUM INFECTION; TUBERCULOSIS; CATS; HISTOPATHOLOGY; DIAGNOSIS	ObjectiveTo determine the feasibility of using polymerase chain reaction to amplify DNA from methanol-fixed, Romanowsky-stained and Ziehl-Neelsen-stained smears to confirm the presence of mycobacteria. Materials and MethodsTissue was obtained from 10 archival slides and 27 slides from a prospective series of consecutive cases. Phosphate buffered saline (500 L) was pipetted onto a stained smear (on a glass slide) using a disposable filtered pipette tip. The material adherent to the slide was scraped from its surface and drawn up into the saline. Routine DNA extraction and purification was carried out before nested polymerase chain reaction testing targeting the 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer region or a TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction. The real-time polymerase chain reaction was also used on thick sections cut from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from 24 canine leproid granulomas. ResultsMycobacterial DNA was detected in 34 of 37 slides. Polymerase chain reaction products could not be amplified from three archived smears stained using the Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast method, probably because its harsher fixation damaged the DNA. With the nested polymerase chain reaction, species identification using internal transcribed spacer sequence analysis was achieved in all instances, diagnosing a wide range of mycobacteria. The real-time polymerase chain reaction detected Mycobacterium sp. CLGDNA within all 24 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens tested. Clinical SignificanceThis technique should provide a non-invasive and cost-effective means of diagnosing mycobacterial infections.

Considering the difficulty of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), increased case volumes may improve patient outcomes. No studies have investigated case volume as a risk factor for readmission after acetabular fracture ORIF. The present study sought to answer the question of whether annual case volume is a risk factor for 30-day unplanned readmission after acetabular fracture ORIF, if there is an identifiable threshold number of cases most predictive of a readmission, and if differences exist between reasons for readmission between high and low-volume centers. Hypothesis: Institutions with a lower annual case volume will have a higher incidence of 30-day unplanned readmissions. Materials and methods: The national readmissions database (NRD) was queried for acetabular fractures that underwent ORIF during 2016. Comorbid conditions were summed, and annual hospital case volume was identified. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated and the Youden index identified threshold case volume most predictive of a 30-day readmission. A multivariable logistic regression was performed with 30-day readmission as the dependent variable and case volume below the threshold an independent variable. Results: A total of 3,407 cases were included with a median age of 43. The 30-day readmission for this cohort was 6.5% (220/3407). ROC curve analysis identified 22 annual cases as the threshold value most predictive of 30-day readmission. Multivariable logistic regression identified age (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.01, p = 0.005), number of comorbidities (OR = 1.35, p < 0.0001), and <= 22 cases (OR = 1.50, p = 0.006) as statistically significant risk factors for 30-day readmission. The most common reason for readmission at both high and low-volume centers was surgical site infection. Discussion: Annual case volume is a statistically significant predictor of 30-day readmission after acetabular fracture ORIF. Performing <= 22 acetabular ORIFs places patients at greater risk for a readmission. Patients at low-volume centers may be predisposed to readmission, and it is paramount to optimize patients prior to discharge, and have appropriate surgeon and hospital resources to treat these complex injuries.

Treatment of distal humerus fractures with LCP DHP™ locking plates in patients older than 65 years	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Distal humerus fracture; ORIF; Elderly	TOTAL ELBOW ARTHROPLASTY; INTERNAL-FIXATION; INTERCONDYLAR FRACTURES; OPEN REDUCTION; INTRAARTICULAR FRACTURES; OPERATIVE TREATMENT; REPLACEMENT	Introduction: Fractures of the distal humerus are often complex and therefore challenging to treat. In elderly patients with decreased bone strength due to osteoporosis, strong fixation is crucial to allow resuming early motion that guarantees a good functional outcome as well as minimising mechanical complications. Locked implants meet these requirements. Here, we report outcomes in a uniform series of patients older than 65 years with distal humerus fractures managed with LCP DHP (R) (Synthes) fixation. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy and limitations of this technique. Hypothesis: LCP DHP provides strong fixation of osteoporotic bone and leads to good clinical and radiological outcomes. Materials and methods: We retrospectively studied 46 consecutive patients (2004-2010) with a mean age of 80 years including 15 with extra-articular and 31 with articular distal humerus fractures. At presentation, 11 complications were noted in nine patients (compound fractures and trauma-related nerve injuries). The transolecranon approach was used in 31 patients. Mean duration of immobilisation was 2.7 weeks in 33 patients. Results: Forty-three patients were re-evaluated after a mean follow-up of 25 months (range, 10-64 months); two patients died and one was lost to follow-up. Flexion was 127 degrees and loss of extension was 23 degrees, producing an average range of motion of 104 degrees. Functional recovery was highly satisfactory with a Mayo Clinic Performance Score of 87 (70-100) and 95% of good and very good results. Postoperative complications consisted of infection (n = 3), metaphyseal nonunion (n = 2), ulnar nerve injury (n = 6), transient radial nerve palsy (n = 1), and peri-articular ossification (n = 4). Compound fracture and worse AO fracture type were associated with worse functional outcomes. Discussion: Despite the high complication rate, functional recovery was similar to that reported in previous case series, including after arthroplasty. Furthermore, the rate of mechanical complications was lower. Thus, our working hypothesis was confirmed.

METHODS: Ten human cadaveric spines underwent C4-C6 lateral mass screw and T1-T2 translaminar (n = 5) versus Pedicle (n = 5) screw fixation. Spines were then potted in polymethylmethacrylate bone cement and placed on a materials testing machine. Rotation about the axis of bending was measured using passive retroreflective markers and infrared motion capture cameras. The motion of C6 relative to T2 in flexion-extension and lateral bending was assessed uninstrumented, immediately after instrumentation, and after 40,000 cycles of 4 N.m flex ion-extension and lateral bending moments at 1 Hz. The effect of instrumentation and cyclical loading on rotational motion across the CTJ was analyzed for significance. RESULTS: Compared with preinstrumented spines, pedicle and translaminar screw constructs significantly (P < 0.001) decreased motion during flexion-extension and lateral bending. After cyclical loading, rotational motion at the CTJ was significantly increased (P < 0.05) during flexion-extension and lateral bending in both groups. With flexion-extension, the mean rotational motion across the CTJ was similar in the translaminar and pedicle constructs immediately after fixation, but slightly greater (P = 0.03) after cyclical loading in the translaminar versus the pedicle screw constructs (0.39 degrees versus 0.26 degrees). Nevertheless, after cyclical loading, the mean angular motion across the CTJ remained less than one half of a degree in both groups. With lateral bending, the mean rotational motion was similar in both translaminar and pedicle screw constructs. CONCLUSION: Both upper thoracic translaminar and pedicle screws allow for rigid fixation at the CTJ. Although translaminar screw constructs demonstrated one eighth of a degree more motion at the CTJ after cycling, this minimal difference is likely less than would influence the biological fusion process. Upper thoracic translaminar screws are a biomechanically effective option to rigidly stabilize the CTJ.

ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Ulnar shaft fracture; Nightstick fracture; Intramedullary pinning	DISTAL RADIOULNAR JOINT; FOREARM FRACTURES; REFRACTURE; BONES	Introduction: Unstable isolated ulnar shaft fractures are rare injuries that need to be surgically treated. The purpose of this study was to compare the functional and radiographic outcomes of two types of surgeries: closed reduction and intramedullary fixation (IMF) by pinning and open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). Hypothesis: Our hypothesis was that IMF obtained similar outcomes to ORIF. Materials and methods: All patients treated for an isolated distal or middle third ulnar shaft fracture between 2016 and 2019 were enrolled into two groups: ORIF and IMF. The technique performed depended on the surgeon's preference and not the type of fracture or patient. Demographic and clinical data (QuickDASH) and complications were retrospectively collected. X-rays were also examined to classify the fracture, assess postoperative reduction quality, and determine the amount of shortening and angulation. Results: A total of 81 patients with a mean age of 34 years were divided into two groups: 34 in ORIF and 47 in IMF. The two groups had similar demographics, mechanisms of injury, and preoperative fracture characteristics. The only difference was smoking (p < 0.001). Despite a greater mean ulnar shortening of 0.4 mm in the IMF group (p = 0.048), there were no significant differences regarding the functional score (QuickDASH) and rate of pseudarthrosis. However, the operative time (p < 0.001) was shorter in the IMF group. Discussion: In the treatment of unstable isolated ulnar shaft fractures, IMF and ORIF had similar clinical and radiographic outcomes in terms of bone healing. The mean ulnar shortening reported in the IMF group was small and was not at risk of developing posttraumatic osteoarthritis. Conclusion: IMF is a feasible therapeutic alternative to ORIF for isolated fractures of the distal two-thirds of the ulnar shaft. Further studies with a higher level of evidence need to be conducted to confirm the equivalence of these two fixation techniques. (c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Methods: FNFs models of Pauwels 30 degrees; 40 degrees; 50 degrees; 60 degrees were created respectively. For Pauwels <= 50 degrees, 1, 2 and 3 Cannulated Compression Screws (CCS) and Porous Tantalum Screws (PTS) were used to fix the fracture for the models. For Pauwels 60 degrees, 3CCS and Medial Buttress Plate (MBP) combined with 1, 2 and 3CCS were used to fix the fracture. Based on the results of the finite element (FE) analysis, the biomechanical properties of each model were compared by analyzing and evaluating the following four parameters: maximal stress of the bone (MBS), maximal stress of the implants (MIS), maximal displacement of bone (MBD), interfragmentary motion (IFM). Results: At Pauwels 30 degrees, the larger parameters were found in 1CCS, which was 94.8 MPa (MBS), 307.7 MPa (MIS), 0.86 mm (MBD) and 0.36 mm (IFM). In 2CCS group, the parameters were 86.1 MPa (MBS), 254.4 MPa (MIS), 0.73 mm (MBD) and 0.27 mm (IFM), which were similar to those of PTS. At Pauwels 40 degrees; 50 degrees, with the increase of the number of used CCS, accordingly, the parameters decreased. Particularly, the MIS (Pauwels 50 degrees) of 1CCS was 1,195.3 MPa, but the other were less than the yield range of the materials. At Pauwels 60 degrees, the MBS of 3CCS group was 128.6 Mpa, which had the risk of failure. In 2CCS + MBP group, the parameters were 124.2 MPa (MBS), 602.5 MPa (MIS), 0.75 mm (MBD) and 0.48 mm (IFM), The model stability was significantly enhanced after adding MBP. Conclusion: Pauwels type I (< 30 degrees) fractures can reduce the number of CCS, and PTS is an appropriate alternative treatment. For Pauwels type II fractures (30 degrees similar to 50 degrees), the 3CCS fixation method is still recommended. For Pauwels type III fractures (> 50 degrees), it is recommended to add MBP to the medial femoral neck and combine with 2CCS to establish a satisfactory fracture healing environment.

Materials and Methods: Consenting patients with mandibular fractures (excluding dentoalveolar, pathologic, previous fractures, or mandibular surgery) were prospectively evaluated for subjective neurosensory disturbance (NSD) and underwent neurosensory testing before treatment and then 1 week, 1.5, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. Results: Eighty patients (men, 83.8%; mean age, 30.0 yr; standard deviation, 12.6 yr) with 123 mandibular sides (43 bilateral) were studied. Injury etiology included assault (33.8%), falls (31.3%), motor vehicle accidents (25.0%), and sports injuries (6.3%). Half the fractures (49.6%) involved the IAN-bearing posterior mandible; all condylar fractures (13.0%) had no NSD. Treatment included open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF; 74.8%), closed reduction and fixation (22.0%), or no treatment (3.3%). Overall prevalence of IAN injury was 33.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.8-42.6) before treatment and 53.8% (95% CI, 46.0-61.6) after treatment. In the IAN-bearing mandible, the prevalence was 56.2% (95% CI, 43.2-69.2) before treatment and 72.9% (95% CI, 63.0-82.7) after treatment. In contrast, this prevalence in the non-IAN-bearing mandible was 12.6% (95% CI, 4.1-21.1) before treatment and 31.6% (95% CI, 20.0-43.3) after treatment. Factors associated with the development of post-treatment IAN injury included fracture site and gap distance (a 1-mm increase was associated with a 27% increase in odds of post-treatment sensory alteration). Time to normalization after treatment was associated with type of treatment (ORIF inhibited normalization) and fracture site (IAN-bearing sites took longer to normalize). Conclusion: IAN injury was 4 times more likely in IAN-bearing posterior mandibular fractures (56.2%) than in non-IAN-bearing anterior mandibular fractures (12.6%). After treatment, IAN injury prevalence (in 12 months) was higher (72.9% in posterior mandible, 31.6% in anterior mandible).

In this study, NH3 synthesis was performed under ambient conditions in a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma reactor. Different tangled wire internal electrodes were employed to understand the influence of electrode materials on plasma ammonia synthesis. Compared with a rod electrode, a tangled wire electrode substantially enhanced the NH3 concentration and reduced the energy cost for ammonia production, which can be attributed to the expanded surface area and the chemisorption properties of the tangled electrodes. The influence of the N2/H2 molar ratio and total flow rate on the reaction performance was also evaluated. The lowest energy cost (59.0 MJ mol- 1) for ammonia production was achieved using a Cu tangled electrode at a total flow rate of 250 ml min-1 and a discharge power of 20 W. The electrical diagnostics of the plasma process showed that the tangled wire electrodes decreased the breakdown voltage of the DBD and enhanced charge deposition, which enhanced the NH3 production. The reaction mechanism was discussed for the process optimisation of ammonia synthesis in a tangled wire DBD system.

Materials and Methods: Twenty-two patients underwent posterior short-segment instrumentation for thoracolumbar fractures in our institute from 2007 to 2010 were included in this retrospective study. Radiological evaluations were carried out by measuring regional kyphosis angle (RA), anterior vertebral body compression percentage (AVC), and sagittal index (SI) during preoperative, postoperative and final follow-up, with the aim to investigate the rate of correction loss and implantation failure in relation to the Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosythese(AO) classification of fracture system and the Load Sharing score system. CT scans were also used to determine the preoperative to postoperative canal compromise ratio. During the final follow-up, clinical outcomes were analysed based on scores from the Denis' Pain's and Work scales and neurological function was scored according to the Frankel classification. Results: At the final follow-up (average duration of 15 months), 21 patients (95%) who partially or fully recovered from thoracolumbar fractures were able to resume daily activities with no complaints of pain, or only slight pain. No deterioration in neurological function were recorded. Upon evaluation at each point of time, (preoperative, postoperative and final follow-up), the average RA improved from 21 degrees to 3.5 degrees to 5.6 degrees, average AVC improved from 40.8% to 90.2% to 88.2%, and average SI changed from 19.1 degrees to 3.1 degrees to 4.1 degrees, respectively. Average canal compromise ratio decreased from 45% to 6.7% after surgery. No correlation was found between loss of correction and AO classification of fracture system, and loss of correction and Load Sharing system scores. Also, no correlation was found between clinical outcomes and the correction loss limited to 10 degrees. Conclusion: Posterior short-segment fixation in thoracolumbar fractures showed a satisfactory outcome in 95% of the patients based on a 15-month follow-up in our institute, even among patients with comminuted fractures injuries.

Treatment of Vancouver B1 periprosthetic femoral fractures using Intrauma Iron Lady® locking plate: A retrospective study on 32 patients	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Periprosthetic Femoral Fracture; PFF; Vancouver B1; Locking plate; Internal Fixation	TOTAL HIP-ARTHROPLASTY; IPSILATERAL FEMUR; FIXATION; CLASSIFICATION; CONJUNCTION; CERCLAGE; STRUT	Introduction: Periprosthetic femoral fractures (PFF) actually represent a serious public health problem. They are reported to occur in 0,1-4.5% of all patients undergoing total hip replacement (THR). PFF are commonly distinguished using the Vancouver classification. This study principal aim is to evaluate results obtained using the Intrauma Iron Lady (R) Conical Coupling locking plate for the treatment of Vancouver type B1 periprosthetic femoral fractures. Materials and Methods: We enrolled 32 patients affected by Vancouver B1 PFF and treated with the same device. Metal cerclages were additionally used in 12 (38%) patients. A clinical and radiographical post-operative follow-up was then planned at 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery; than the follow-up was annually fixed. Results: Mean age at the moment of trauma was 76,7 years. All involved femoral stem were uncemented and the they were all radiographically and intraoperativelly judged to be stable. Mean post-operative follow-up period was 5,8 years. 29 patients (91%) presented healed fracture at 6 months follow-up. 9% patients developed a superficial surgical site infection. Discussion and Conclusions: Literature highlights that Vancouver B1 PFF should be treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using polyaxial locking plates. However, no single technique has gained universal acceptance to be superior that the other. The current reported healing rate ranges from 40 to 100%. Using the Intrauma Iron Lady (R) Conical Coupling locking plate, we obtained a healing rate of 91%; this data is consistent with recent literature. Moreover, the role of cerclages in addition to femoral plating is actually controversial because they potentially damage the soft callus vascularization. Our results showed no difference in term of healing rate between patients with and without cerclages, according with some of most recent articles. A prospective study with a higher number of patients should be carried out in order to better evaluate the role of cerclages on healing rate but also the complications frequency after PFF surgical treatment.

Nonunited humerus shaft fractures treated by external fixator augmented by intramedullary rod	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Humerus; nonunion; external fixation; intramedullary fixation	SURGICAL-TREATMENT; ILIZAROV; FAILURE	Background: Nonunion of humeral shaft fractures after previously failed surgical treatment presents a challenging therapeutic problem especially in the presence of osteoporosis, bone defect, and joint stiffness. It would be beneficial to combine the use of external fixation technique and intramedullary rod in the treatment of such cases. The present study evaluates the results of using external fixator augmented by intramedullary rod and autogenous iliac crest bone grafting (ICBG) for the treatment of humerus shaft nonunion following previously failed surgical treatment. Materials and Methods: Eighteen patients with atrophic nonunion of the humeral shaft following previous implant surgery with no active infection were included in the present study. The procedure included exploration of the nonunion, insertion of intramedullary rod (IM rod), autogenous ICBG and application of external fixator for compression. Ilizarov fixator was used in eight cases and monolateral fixator in ten cases. The monolateral fixator was preferred for females and obese patients to avoid abutment against the breast or chest wall following the use of Ilizarov fixator. The fixator was removed after clinical and radiological healing of the nonunion, but the IM rod was left indefinitely. The evaluation of results included both bone results (union rate, angular deformity and limb shortening) and functional outcome using the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) rating scale. Results: The mean follow-up was 35 months (range 24 to 52 months). Bone union was obtained in all cases. The functional outcome was satisfactory in 15 cases (83) and unsatisfactory in 3 cases (17) due to joint stiffness. The time to bone healing averaged 4.2 months (range 3 to 7 months). The external fixator time averaged 4.5 months (range 3.2 to 8 months). Superficial pin tract infection occurred in 39 (28/72) of the pins. No cases of nerve palsy, refracture, or deep infection were encountered. Conclusion: The proposed technique is effective in treating humeral nonunion especially in the presence of osteoporosis and short bone segments. The inclusion of intramedullary rod as internal splint improves stability of fixation and prevents refracture after fixator removal.

The effectiveness of the magnesium alloy implants in osteosynthesis was evaluated using a bone fracture model involving the tibia of beagle dogs. For the monolithic WE43 implants, radiological, and histological evaluation revealed that bone trabeculae around the implanted monolithic WE43 decreased because of an inflammatory response. However, there was no damage due to hydrogen gas or inflammatory response in the bone tissue around the anodized WE43 implants. After 4 weeks, all the PLLA implants (n=3) had broken but the WE43 implants had not (n=6). These results suggest that the WE43 implants had sufficient strength to fix bone fractures at load-bearing sites in orthopedic and oral maxillofacial surgery. Therefore, these biodegradable magnesium alloys are good candidates for replacing biodegradable polymers. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Quaternary Ammonium Salt Anchored on CuO Flowers as Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Catalyst for Fixation of CO<sub>2</sub> into Cyclic Carbonates	CATALYSIS LETTERS			English	Article						Hybrid material; Heterogeneous catalysis; CO2 fixation; Epoxides; Cyclic carbonates; Acid-base cooperativity	COPPER-OXIDE CATALYSTS; EFFICIENT SYNTHESIS; IONIC LIQUID; HYDROTHERMAL SYNTHESIS; STYRENE CARBONATE; CHEMICAL FIXATION; EPOXIDES; DIOXIDE; CYCLOADDITION; REACTIVITY	The selective fixation of CO2 and epoxides into cyclic carbonates offers an atom-economical approach towards promising utilization of anthropogenic CO2 gas. This work demonstrates the development of recyclable organic-inorganic hybrid TBAI@CuO catalyst containing quaternary ammonium (TBAI) salt as active organic groups and CuO flowers as the inorganic component. Initially, CuO flowers was synthesized using a simple oxidation-precipitation method followed by immobilization of TBAI groups using impregnation method. The impregnated TBAI groups functioned as the active basic centers, whereas CuO flowers with effective surface area provided heterogeneity, Lewis acidic sites, facilitated better dispersion and strong interaction of TBAI. Resultantly, hybrid TBAI@CuO catalyst consisted of dual-active sites which played a decisive role in manipulating catalytic activity without requirement of a co-catalyst. With styrene oxide and CO2 as model substrates, the present catalyst system delivered 95% conversion and 97% selectivity towards styrene carbonate under solvent-free and milder reaction conditions when compared to other single metal oxide catalysts. The homogeneously dispersed TBAI groups in strong interaction with CuO flowers provided simultaneous access to both Lewis acidic as well as basic sites and hence resulted in superior catalytic activity. Meanwhile, hybrid TBAI@CuO catalyst showed catalytic adequacy for various terminal and internal epoxides. This catalytic system also presented good reusability without prominent loss in activity and no leaching of active TBAI groups. Based on characterization results, a plausible reaction mechanism was predicted to support the cycloaddition reaction with hybrid TBAI@CuO catalyst. It was proposed that inorganic Lewis acidic CuO activated the epoxide whereas the immobilized TBAI groups activated the inert CO2 molecule and stabilized the epoxide after ring opening. Therefore, the CuO flowers acting in concert with the immobilized TBAI groups showed exceptional acid-base cooperativity and provided high selectivity towards cyclic carbonates.{GRAPHIACAL ABSTRACT}	[Prasad, Divya; Alla, Sarat Chandra; Bawiskar, Dipak B.; Jadhav, Arvind H.] Jain Univ, Ctr Nano & Mat Sci, Jain Global Campus, Bangalore 562112, Karnataka, India; [Prasad, Divya] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gholap, Sandeep Suryabhan] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, KAUST Catalysis Ctr, Div Phys Sci & Engn, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia	Jain University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; King Abdullah University of Science & Technology	Jadhav, AH (corresponding author), Jain Univ, Ctr Nano & Mat Sci, Jain Global Campus, Bangalore 562112, Karnataka, India.	jadhav.ah@gmail.com	gholap, sandeep/AAH-2765-2020; Jadhav, Arvind/LEL-9351-2024; Prasad, Divya/GPP-1692-2022	gholap, sandeep/0000-0003-2080-1510; Prasad, Divya/0000-0002-8401-229X	Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Government of India; Centre for Nano and Material Sciences (CNMS), JAIN University, Bangalore;  [CRG/2021/000656];  [II(39)/17/005/2017SG]	Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Government of India; Centre for Nano and Material Sciences (CNMS), JAIN University, Bangalore; ; 	& nbsp;The authors would like to acknowledge the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Government of India, for financial support through Core Research Grant (CRG) File no.-CRG/2021/000656.

The purpose of this study was to describe the complications and outcomes following operative fixation of SAD type 2 ankle fractures. Materials and methods: We identified all SAD-2 ankle fractures that presented at our institution's two hospitals from 2006-2018. Demographics, operative data, and complications (deep infection, superficial infection, delayed union, failure of fixation, and unplanned reoperation) were recorded for all patients. Lastly, all included patients were contacted by telephone for the administration of an 8-question Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function (PF) and Pain Interference questionnaire (PI). Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors for complication or poor functional outcome score. Results: 65 patients met inclusion criteria. The average time to surgery was 14 days and average follow-up was 20.5 (range: 0.4-60.9) weeks. There were 9 (13.8%) complications (4 deep infections, 3 superficial infections, 1 delayed union, 1 failure of fixation) and 6 unplanned reoperations. Univariate and multivariate analysis failed to identify any statistically significant risk factors for complication or reoperation. Eleven patients participated in the administration of PROMIS score questionnaires at a mean of 3.4 years postoperatively. The average PROMIS Physical Function T-score was 42.3 +/- 11.3 and the average PROMIS Pain Interference T-score was 55.8 +/- 7.8. Younger age was associated with a higher physical function score. The use of a direct medial approach to the medial malleolus was associated with a lower pain interference score. Conclusion: The overall complication rate for SAD (OTA/AO 44A2.3) type 2 ankle fractures is similar to that of the general ankle fracture population. We were unable to identify risk factors for complication or reoperation. Mean patient reported outcomes are within one standard deviation of the general population. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Direct repair of the pars defect is a logical alternative to fusion as it helps to preserve the motion segment and prevents abnormal stresses at the adjacent levels. The purpose of the study is to analyze the clinical and radiological results of direct screw osteosynthesis of the pars defect by the Bucks method in patients with symptomatic spondylolysis with or without grade 1 spondylolisthesis. Materials and Methods: Nine patients (six males, three females, mean age 24 years) with symptomatic spondylolysis with or without grade 1 spondylolisthesis and a normal disc in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), who failed conservative treatment, underwent surgery between January 2000 and April 2009. Of them five patients had bilateral lysis at one level, one had bilateral lysis at three levels and two levels each and two had unilateral lysis at one level. Direct pars repair by the Bucks method with internal fixation of the defect using 4.5 mm cortical screws and cancellous bone grafting was done. The mean follow-up period was 45 months. MacNab criteria were used to evaluate the postoperative functional outcome. Healing of the pars defect was assessed by plain radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scan. Results: Spondylolysis was bilateral in seven and unilateral in two patients. Two patients had associated grade 1 spondylolisthesis. The mean operative time was 58 minutes (range 45 - 75 minutes) and blood loss was 98 ml (50 - 140 ml). Although radiological fusion was observed in all patients at a mean follow-up of 45 months (range 9 to 108 months), the functional outcome was excellent in two patients and good in five, with one fair and one poor result. The overall result of the procedure was satisfactory in 78 (7/9) of the patients. The two patients with associated grade 1 spondylolisthesis had fair and poor results. No complications were encountered in the perioperative or postoperative period. Conclusions: In carefully selected patients, direct repair of the pars defect by the Bucks technique of internal fixation and bone grafting was a safe and effective alternative to fusion in younger patients with symptomatic spondylolysis, without associated spondylolisthesis, who failed conservative management.

Materials and Methods The data of 48 patients, ages between 18 and 55 years, working in a job and having AO/OTA type C distal humerus fracture were retrospectively evaluated. Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) was used to determine functional results. Postoperative radiographs were evaluated to determine the rate of union, degenerative changes, malunion and heterotopic ossification. Financial outcome form was constituted by the authors and the patients asked whether she/he could return to their pre-injury works after treatment finished and the financial status of the patients during the treatment and after the treatment. Results The mean flexion-extension arc was 114 degrees +/- 12 degrees(range 85 degrees-135 degrees) and the mean MEPS score was 85 +/- 11(range 65-100). The average time to return to work was 6.5 +/- 2.4 months (3-12 months). AO type C2 and C3 fractures and heterotopic ossification negatively affected the functional results and also adversely affected the patients' return to their pre-injury works. 38 (79%) patients returned to pre-injury work and 29 (76%) of them started to work at the same position before the fracture occured. Nine of 38 patients (24%) had to change their positions. Among the 48 patients, 10 patients (21%) could not return to the same work, 7 of them found light duty and 3 of them had not been to work. Conclusion Although the functional results of surgical treatment of intra-articular distal humerus fractures are good, at the end of the treatment, especially heavy workers may have difficulties in returning to their former works.

However, extensile exposure can lead to complications. Fracture with minimal displacement can be fixed by a minimally invasive method. Percutaneous screwing for an anterior column fracture of acetabulum under conventional 2D fluoroscopy is a demanding technique. With fluoroscopic-based computerized navigation, we can determine the position of a screw real time intra-operatively with less exposure to radiation. We proposed that a fluoroscopy-based computerized navigational system would simplify operation procedures. The purpose of this study is to test the application of the fluoroscopy-based computerized navigational system for anterior column fracture of acetabulum. Materials and methods A prospective cohort study was conducted. Three patients with mildly displaced or non-displaced anterior column fracture of acetabulum were treated with a retrograde lag screw under a fluoroscopy-based computer navigation system. There were two males and one female with a mean age of 39 years and all patients were followed up for more than 1 year. Patients were allowed to perform joint movement exercises and to walk with partial weightbearing on the first day post-operatively. Results The mean operation time was 40 min (range 30-45 min) from the use of fluoroscopy to wound closure and the mean total fluoroscopy time was 38 s (range 35-45 s). Total blood loss was less than 10 ml. The patients were pain free 1 week after the operation and had good functional recovery thereafter. No complication was noted postoperatively. Conclusion Though the indication for this procedure is limited, we think that there should be potential to apply the screw with less radiation by fluoroscopic-based computerized navigation. Once anatomic reduction can be achieved by the close method in the anterior column fracture of the acetabulum, percutaneous screw fixation under fluoroscopic-based computerized navigation could be a reliable method; however; validating the position of the guide pin and screw by fluoroscopy is suggested.

J	Thirumalai, A; Mikalef, P; Jose, RM				Thirumalai, Andal; Mikalef, Petros; Jose, Rajive Mathew			The Versatile Hook Plate in Avulsion Fractures of the Hand	ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY			English	Article						hook plates; avulsion fractures; mallet; hand	MALLET FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; FINGER	Avulsion fractures can pose technical difficulties for surgical fixation. The fragments are often small and around finger joints with access being difficult due to attachment of ligaments or tendons. Traditionally, these have been treated using K wires, lag screws, or pullout sutures. Hook plates were originally described for operative management of mallet fractures. We have been using hook plates in our unit for over 10 years. However, over the years, we have extended their use to other avulsion fractures in the hand such as proximal interphalangeal joint fracture dislocations, central slip avulsions, flexor digitorum profundus avulsions and collateral ligament avulsions. The aim of this article is to describe the technique of fabricating a hook plate and using it for avulsion fractures in the hand. A few illustrative cases are discussed along with a review of the current literature. Methods In a retrospective review of our use of hook plates in hand fractures from 2008 to 2014, a total of 63 cases were identified from the hospital data base. There were 35 cases of Mallet fractures, 16 cases of proximal interphalangeal joint fracture dislocations, 5 cases of flexor digitorum profundus avulsion fractures, 5 cases of Central slip avulsions, and 2 collateral ligament avulsions. Results All fractures healed well with this technique with no biomechanical failures and good functional outcome. Plates needed removal in a total of 25 cases, of which 14 were in mallet fractures. Thirteen (21%) cases suffered complications, of which the majority were again related to mallet fractures. Conclusions The hook plate is a simple device that can be created quite easily with readily available materials. We have extended the use of these plates to avulsion fracture fixation in the hand and found this to be a versatile technique. The risk of fragmenting the small fracture fragment is reduced because the hooks secure it and the plate is fixed in the bone. If done meticulously, joint congruence can be achieved. It has a biomechanical advantage over current methods of fracture fixation of small but important bone fragments in the hand.

Operative Versus Nonoperative Treatment of Midshaft Clavicle Fractures in Adolescents	JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						adolescents; clavicle fracture; treatment; operative; nonoperative	THORACIC OUTLET SYNDROME; CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT; BRACHIAL-PLEXUS; FOLLOW-UP; NONUNION; MALUNIONS; SECONDARY; SEQUELAE	Background: Midshaft clavicle fractures in adolescents have traditionally been treated nonoperatively. Recent studies in the adult literature have shown a higher prevalence of symptomatic malunion, nonunion, and poor functional outcome after nonoperative treatment of displaced fractures. The purpose of this study was to compare operative versus nonoperative treatment of displaced clavicle fractures in adolescents. Materials and Methods: Adolescents who sustained closed midshaft clavicle fractures between 2000 and 2008 were identified in our institutional trauma registry. Medical records were reviewed for patient demographics, injury characteristics, treatment, and outcomes. Results: Forty-two consecutive patients (mean age 15.4 y) with 43 closed midshaft clavicle fractures were identified. Twenty-five patients were treated nonoperatively with a sling or figure-of-8 brace. Seventeen patients were treated operatively with acute plate fixation for fractures displaced more than 2 centimeters. The average shortening at injury was 12.5 mm in the nonoperative group and 27.5 mm in the operative group (P = 0.003). The mean time to radiographic union for displaced fractures was 8.7 weeks in the nonoperative group and 7.4 weeks in the operative group (P = 0.02). There were no nonunions in either group. All complications in the operative group were related to local hardware prominence. The mean time to return to activities was 16 weeks in the nonoperative group and 12 weeks in the operative group. Symptomatic malunion, with a mean fracture shortening of 26 mm, developed in 5 patients in the nonoperative group. Four of these patients elected corrective osteotomy with internal fixation and all went on to union with resolution of their symptoms. Conclusions: Plate fixation of displaced midshaft clavicle fracture reliably restores length and alignment. It resulted in shorter time to union with low complication rates. Symptomatic malunion in adolescents may be more common than earlier thought after significantly displaced fractures. Corrective osteotomy with plate fixation can restore clavicle anatomy and eliminate symptoms associated with malunion.	[Have, Kelly L.

Outcomes from surgical treatment of middle-third clavicle fractures non-union in adults: A series of 21 cases	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Clavicle fracture; Clavicle non-union; Internal fixation; Bone graft	AUTOLOGOUS BONE-GRAFT; INTENSITY PULSED ULTRASOUND; OPERATIVE TREATMENT; PLATE FIXATION; PROPIONIBACTERIUM-ACNES; COMPRESSION PLATE; DELAYED UNION; RECONSTRUCTION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; INFECTION	Introduction: The aim of our study was to evaluate the results of surgical treatment of clavicle non-union after failure of conservative treatment. Our hypothesis was that stable fixation with bone graft derived from local bone stock (fracture site) or the iliac crest was essential to achieve bone union. Material and methods: Twenty-one patients with a symptomatic middle-third clavicle non-union after failure of initial conservative treatment were included in the study. Delay between the initial fracture and surgery for non-union was 27 months (6-144). In five cases, the non-union was hypertrophic and bone graft was obtained locally from the callus. In 16 patients, the non-union was atrophic. Bone was harvested from the iliac crest as cortico-cancellous graft (7 patients) and cancellous graft (8 patients). One patient refused bone grafting. A 3.5-mm plate with non-locking screws was placed anterior in 12 and superior in 9 patients. Results: At 41 months average follow-up (minimum of 12 months), 20 patients were available for review. Bone healing was obtained initially in 15 cases. Six complications required a revision procedure: 3 for infection and 3 for mechanical failure. At last follow-up, 19 patients were satisfied with the surgery. Average Constant score was 84 +/- 26 points (7-100), and Quick DASH score 17 +/- 22 points (0-91). Radiographic bone healing was obtained in 19 of the cases. Conclusion: Treatment of middle-third clavicle non-union after initial failure of conservative treatment with stable fixation and bone graft is a reliable, well-suited and effective treatment. Our hypothesis was verified. Preoperative evaluation of appearance of the non-union X-rays can be used to determine the type of bone graft needed, but the final decision is often taken during surgery.

Inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) injuries are seen frequently in mandibular fractures as well as after ORIF of these fractures due to the exposition and the close proximity of the nerve during fracture reduction. Therefore the continuity of the IAN can be disrupted. Permanent injury to the IAN can result in diminished quality of life. This retrospective study was designed to objectively analyse the incidence and the outcome of pre- and postoperative mental nerve hypoesthesia after ORIF of mandibular fractures. Material and methods: Patients who were consecutively treated at the Department of Cranio-Maxillofacial and Oral Surgery of the University Hospital Zurich between 2004 and 2010 with mandibular fractures who underwent ORIF were included. Follow-up period was 12 months. Demographic, pre-, ped- and postsurgical data were tabulated and statistically evaluated using the chi(2) test and the Kruskall-Wallis-Test. Results: 340 patients met the inclusion criteria. 27% of the study population presented with postinjury (preoperative) mental nerve hypoesthesia, 46% suffered from purely postoperative hypoesthesia and 27% showed no nerve damage. Complete recovery was seen in 70% of all cases, partial recovery in 20% of the cases and less than 10% suffered from a permanent (>12 months) IAN damage. Mandibular angle fractures were accompanied with significantly higher rates of hypoesthesia (79% vs. 68%). Recovery rate was significantly worse in older patients, when preoperative hypoesthesia was present (66% vs. 73%) and in. patients with multiple fractures in proximity to the IAN (36% vs. 52%). Mandibular body fractures showed worse recovery rates than fractures that did not affect the body (44% vs. 52%). Conclusion: The present study shows that IAN injury is seen frequently in mandibular fractures. Mental nerve hypoesthesia may influence quality of life. Nerve continuity may not be preserved due to the initial trauma or may result as a postoperative complication. Nevertheless the results of this study show a high potential for full recovery.

The cause of injury is often a fall on an outstretched hand with an extended wrist, and in most cases there is a concomitant distal radius fracture. The aims of this retrospective study were to investigate the results of the current treatment of distal ulna fractures in adults, with or without a concomitant distal radius fracture, and if a recently presented fracture classification could predict outcome. Materials and methods Patients, 18 years or older, treated for a fracture of the distal third of ulna in our county, were included. Fractures of the styloid tip were excluded. The radiographs of the fractures were independently classified by two specialists in radiology according to the 2018 AO/OTA classification. Follow-up was performed 5-7 years after the injury, through the questionnaire Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) and new radiographs of both wrists. Results Ninety-six patients with 97 fractures were included and filled out the PRWE. 65 patients also had new radiographs taken. 79 patients were women and the mean age at the time of injury was 63 years (SD 14.5). The most common fracture class was the extra-articular transverse fracture, 2U3A2.3 (42%). We found that 40% of the fractures had been treated by internal fixation and only 2 fractures had not healed, one conservatively treated and one operated. The median PRWE was 15 (IQR 33.5). The PRWE score was significantly worse in the operated ulna fractures (p = 0.01) and this was also true for extra-articular transverse fractures 2U3A2.3 (p = 0.001). Initial displacement was more common in operated transverse fractures, but it could not be proven that this was the reason for the inferior result. Conclusions Distal ulna fractures almost always unite and the result is comparable to that of isolated distal radius fractures when measured by PRWE. Based on the opinions of the radiologists and how often a consensus discussion was needed for classification, we found the updated AO classification system difficult to use, if dependent only on standard radiographic views. In the present study, transverse extra-articular ulna fractures did not benefit from internal fixation regardless if associated with a distal radius fracture or isolated.

Bioabsorbable devices are mostly made of the polymers polylactide, polyglycolide, and their copolymers [polyglycolide-co-polylactide and P(L/DL)LA]. Using the technique of self-reinforcement of bioabsorbable materials, it is possible to manufacture osteofixation devices with ultra high strength. Self-reinforced polyglycolide-co-polylactide 80/20 was selected to make devices (Biosorb PDX) for this study because of its favorable degradation characteristics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of using self-reinforced polyglycolide-co-polylactide 80/20 (Biosorb) plates and screws in the fixation of osteotomies in craniomaxillofacial surgery. In a prospective study, 165 patients (161 children and 4 adults) were operated on in four European Union centers (Paris, Innsbruck, London, and Oulu) from May 1, 1998 to January 31, 2002. Indications included correction of dyssynostotic deformities (n = 159), reconstruction of bone defects after trauma (n = 2), tumor removal (n = 2), and treatment of encephalocele (n = 2). Plates used were 0.8, 1, or 1.2 mm thick, and screws had an outer (thread) diameter of 1.5 or 2 mm and a length of 4, 6, or 8 mm. Tacks had an outer diameter of 1.5 or 2 mm and a length of 4 or 6 mm. During surgery, the devices were easy to handle and apply and provided stable fixation apart from 2 cases. Postoperative complications occurred in 12 cases (7.3%), comprising infection (n = 6), bone resorption (n = 4), diabetes insipidus (n = 1), delayed skin wound healing/skin slough (n = 2), and liquorrhea (n = 1). Accordingly, self-reinforced polyglycolide-co-polylactide 80/20 (Biosorb) plates and screws can be used safely and with a favorable outcome in corrective cranioplasties, especially in infants and young children.

Recommendations regarding the application of primary autologous bone grafting in the surgical treatment of comminuted diaphyseal forearm fractures are conflicting. Some recent studies suggested that there is no difference in the union rate between simple and comminuted forearm fractures and that the use of bone grafting in the treatment of these fractures is therefore not necessary. Our hypothesis was that among comminuted forearm fractures there is a small group of fractures with a very large extent of comminution that heal with a significantly lower union rate and a prolonged time to union compared with other fractures. We believe that in these fractures bone grafting could help to reduce the time to union and further decrease the rate of nonunion. Materials and methods. We reviewed the results of the treatment of 214 consecutive patients who sustained 319 diaphyseal fractures of forearm bones. To prove our hypothesis, union rate and time to union in fractures with different extents of comminution were compared. All fractures were treated by open reduction and internal fixation with plates without the use of bone grafting. In addition, the study evaluated other factors that could influence the union rate and time to union in observed fractures. Results. Separate analysis of union rate and time to union in fracture groups with different extents of comminution confirmed our hypothesis only partially. Although we proved that fractures with bone loss greater than two-thirds of the diameter of the diaphysis had a significantly prolonged time to union, we could not demonstrate a significant difference in the union rate between groups. Based on these findings, we believe that primary autologous bone grafting of comminuted diaphyseal forearm fractures is not necessary in most cases. If used, its application should be reserved only for fractures where the bone loss exceeds two-thirds of the diameter of the diaphysis. Such fractures are rare; in our study, they accounted for only 5% of all fractures. Conclusion. The most important factors found to influence the union rate and time to union were stability of fixation and type of plate used for fixation.

Indications and results for the Exogen™ ultrasound system in the management of non-union: A 59-case pilot study	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Non-union; Fracture healing; Ultrasound	INTENSITY PULSED ULTRASOUND	Introduction: This pilot series sought to assess the use of external ultrasound stimulation (Exogen (TM)) in the treatment of femoral or tibial non-union. Materials and methods: A continuous retrospective study was conducted from 2004 to 2009. It included patients with a non-united fracture or osteotomy at 6 months or more post-surgery, with less than 10 mm inter-fragment gap. Daily 20-min ultrasound sessions were continued until bone healing was achieved or for a maximum 6-month duration. Radio-clinical control was performed at months 3 and 6; treatment compliance and transmitter positioning were checked at each follow-up visit. Results: Sixty non-unions were included in the series. One patient was excluded for early material breakage. Mean fracture-to-surgery interval was 271 days. The 6-month consolidation rate was 88%. There was no loss to follow-up. Mean ultrasound treatment duration was 151 days (range, 90-240 days). Bone healing correlated significantly with stability of the internal fixation assembly (P = 0.01). The seven cases of failure included four fixations, considered unstable at inclusion, one femoral non-union associated with BMI 45 and one inadequate subchondral roughening (at the time of arthrodesis). There was a significant difference in delay to non-union treatment start between the groups with (251 days) and without (420 days) bone healing. Discussion: The present results are in line with the literature. The main prognostic factors were fracture fixation stability, short time to treatment, and inter-fragment gap less than 10 mm. Bone healing rates in the literature are around 80% for non-union treated at around 6 months, versus 60% for more than 12 months' delay. Factors such as gender, bone site, smoking, numbers of previous operations or type of osteosynthesis do not impact consolidation. External treatment offers an alternative to traditional surgery (graft, or bone-marrow concentrate or bone morphogenetic protein injection), provided that the fracture fixation is stable. Bone healing rates are better, and the procedure is non-invasive. External treatment results using ultrasound are similar to those using electromagnetic fields; the main difference lies in treatment session duration, which is 20 min for ultrasound, versus 3 hours for electromagnetic fields. Active patient commitment is vital, as the treatment is delivered at home, although the machine is equipped with a monitor to count treatment cycles. Conclusion: The 88% bone healing rate supports advocating first-line implementation in nonunion of less than 10 mm with stable osteosynthesis. This rate is higher than in traditional surgery, with a unit cost at least 60% lower: (sic)1772 for external therapy, versus (sic)4480 for decortication with or without fracture fixation exchange (itemized 08c50 under the French healthcare treatment coding system).

The preparation of butyl methacrylate-ethylene dimethacrylate-based monolithic stationary phases with desired porous structures was achieved within titanium tubing with pre-oxidised internal walls. The oxidised titanium surface was subsequently silanised with 3-trimethoxysilylpropyl methacrylate resulting in tight bonding of butyl methacrylate porous monolith to the internal walls, providing stationary phase stability at column temperatures up to 110 C and at operating column pressure drops of >28 MPa. The titanium housed monoliths exhibited a uniform and dense porous structure, which provided peak efficiencies of up to 59,000 theoretical plates per meter when evaluated for the separation of small molecules in reversed-phase mode, under optimal conditions (achieved at 15 mu L/min and temperature of 110 degrees C for naphthalene with a retention factor, k=0.58). The developed column was applied to the reversed-phase isocratic separation of a text mixture of pesticides. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Patients and methods: Between May 2019 and May 2022, a total of 44 patients (33 males, 11 females; mean age: 40.6 +/- 11.8 years; range, 20 to 68 years) who were diagnosed with AFs based on clinical symptoms, X-ray and computed tomography (CT) and underwent open reduction and internal fixation in Hospital of Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether 3D printing was applied as the experimental group (n=24) and control group (n=20). In the experimental group, pelvic and acetabular data were imported into a 3D printer, and an equal-scale highly simulated model was printed using photosensitive resin as the 3D printing material. The model was used to develop more specific personalized surgical plans, to determine the optimal sequence of surgical procedures for fracture reduction, and simulate surgery in vitro. Results: In the experimental group, the mean surgical duration was shorter (123.57 +/- 22.05 vs. 163.57 +/- 26.20 min, p<0.001), the mean intraoperative bleeding loss was lower (557.14 +/- 174.15 vs. 885.71 +/- 203.27 mL, p<0.001), and the frequency of intraoperative fluoroscopy was lower (8.64 +/- 1.65 vs. 12.07 +/- 2.76, p<0.001) than in the control group. No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups in the Visual Analog Scale scores after surgery or the hip function score after treatment (p>0.05). No major postoperative complications were observed in any of the patients. Conclusion: Compared to conventional surgical treatment, preoperative 3D printing-assisted treatment for adult patients with AFs can significantly reduce surgical duration, intraoperative bleeding loss and frequency of intraoperative C-arm fluoroscopy, reducing surgical difficulty and improving surgical safety.

There is no consensus about optimal methods and satisfactory quality of treatment. Materials and Methods During 2010 to 2014, 226 pediatric patients were treated under anesthesia for tibia shaft fractures in Finland's five university hospitals. A total of 164 (73%) patients had closed fractures of the tibia or both tibia and fibula without other injuries (62 tibia only and 102 both tibia and fibula). Forty-one (18%) had open tibia fractures, 16 had additional fractures, and 5 (2%) had sustained a polytrauma (Injury Severity Score [ISS]>15). Treatment methods, follow-up protocols, complications, and the outcome were analyzed. Results A total of 143 (63%) of the tibia fractures were treated surgically: 87 (53%) closed fractures, 36 (88%) open fractures, 15 (94%) with additional fractures, and 5 (2%) polytrauma patients. The rate of surgical treatment of closed tibia fractures was significantly higher in patients older than 10 and in patients with a concomitant fibula fracture. Fasciotomy was done in 33 (15%) patients. Reoperations were performed in 13 (6%) patients because of unsatisfactory treatment (inappropriate primary reduction 6, malunion 6, and non-union 1). There were no differences between the five university hospitals in treatment or follow-up protocols. Conclusion Internal fixation is used for the majority of tibia shaft fractures treated under anesthesia in university hospitals in Finland. Serious fracture or treatment related complications are very rare, but the percentage (6%) of re-operations because of unsatisfactory standard of treatment should be lower and could probably be improved by concentrating internal fixation to fewer hands. A prospective randomized controlled trial comparing non-operative treatment to intramedullary nailing in pediatric tibia fractures should be performed.

The fracture inclusion criteria were a displacement of the shaft of >50% of its width and/or >45 degrees of angulation. Follow-up examinations were performed at 4, 12, and 24 months. The main outcome measures were the Constant and DASH scores and HRQoL according to the EQ-5D. Results: Eight patients (16%) were re-operated upon during the study period. At the final follow-up the mean Constant score was 61 and the mean DASH score 32. The EQ-5D(index) score decreased from 0.86 before the fracture to 0.62 at 4 months. At 12 months the EQ-5D(index) score was 0.65 and at 24 months 0.68. The values at all follow-ups were significantly lower than before the fracture (P < .001 in all 3 comparisons). Conclusion: Locking plates appear to be a good treatment alternative in elderly patients with a displaced 2-part fracture of the surgical neck of the proximal humerus with an acceptable complication rate and an acceptable functional outcome; however, rigorous attention has to be paid to avoid screw penetration. Despite the overall acceptable functional outcome, the patients reported a substantial negative effect upon their HRQoL. Level of evidence: Level IV, Case Series, Treatment Study.

Malreduction remains a problem in patients with an ankle joint fracture combined with a lower tibiofibular syndesmosis injury. Current methods of malreduction evaluation have many limitations, and novel techniques are required.Objectives. The aim of the study was to investigate the association between the distance between the an-terior and posterior edges of the fibula at a 15 & DEG; lateral internal rotation and postoperative malreduction in patients with an ankle joint fracture combined with a lower tibiofibular syndesmosis injury.Materials and methods. This prospective observational cohort study enrolled 187 patients diagnosed with an ankle joint fracture combined with a lower tibiofibular syndesmosis injury between January 2020 and January 2022. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to their postoperative malreduction condition: the malreduction group and the non-malreduction group. After tibiofibular syndesmosis reduction, a computed tomography (CT) scan was used to measure the distance between the anterior and posterior edges of the fibula at a standard lateral position and a position with a lateral internal rotation of 15 & DEG;. Demographic data and basic clinical characteristics were recorded for all patients. Results. The mean distance between the anterior and posterior edges of the fibula was longer in malreduc-tion patients than non-malreduction patients at the standard lateral and 15 & DEG; lateral internal rotation positions. At a lateral internal rotation of 15 & DEG;, the distance between the anterior and posterior edges correlated negatively with the postoperative Mazur and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores, and cor-related positively with the length of hospitalization and fracture healing time. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves revealed the potential postoperative malreduction diagnostic value of fibular anterior-posterior edge distance using an internal rotation of 15 & DEG;. Postoperative AOFAS score, length of hospitalization, fracture healing time, and the distance between the anterior and posterior edges of the fibula at a lateral internal rotation of 15 & DEG; were independent risk factors of malreduction.Conclusions. The fibular anterior-posterior edge distance at an internal rotation of 15 & DEG; is associated with postoperative ankle joint function and the occurrence of malreduction.

When a concomitant lateral condyle fracture is present, it may be used for a trans-fracture approach to facilitate exposure and fracture reduction. This study aimed to investigate the frequency of lateral condyle fractures in coronal shear fractures of the distal humerus and analyze fracture reduction, fracture union and clinical results following ORIF through a trans-fracture approach. Materials and methods All adult patients who underwent treatment for an acute distal humerus fracture during a three-year period in our level-one trauma center were identified. All fractures were classified according to the Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA/AO) fracture classification system and all B3 fractures were classified according to the Dubberley classification. B3 fractures with a concomitant radial condyle fracture were identified. The clinical and radiological results, (Mayo Elbow Performance Score = MEPS, Visual Analogue Scale = VAS, range of motion), complications and revision surgeries were analyzed. Results 53 patients (mean age 52 +/- 19 years) were identified. 13 fractures (24.5%) were B3 fractures. Four of them (30.8%) had a concomitant radial condyle fracture. All of these patients underwent ORIF with headless cannulated compression screws and a (postero-)lateral locking plate through a trans-fracture approach. At a minimum follow-up of 24 months, the MEPS was 88 +/- 12 points, the VAS was 2 +/- 1 and the range of motion was 118 degrees +/- 12 degrees. All fractures showed anatomic reduction. One patient developed partial avascular necrosis and underwent arthrolysis at 6 months. One patient underwent partial hardware removal and lateral collateral ligament bracing at 6 months. Conclusions Lateral condyle fractures are present in about one third of coronal shear fractures of the distal humerus. This injury can be used for a trans-fracture approach to facilitate exposure and to reliably achieve anatomic fracture reduction.

This prospective study was designed to reflect the relationship between injury-to-surgery interval (ISI) and traumatic ONFH based on a canine model of femoral neck fractures. Material/Methods: Twenty-four dogs were equally divided randomly into 3 groups. A lateral L-shape approach centered left great trochanter was used for exposure of the femoral neck. A low-speed drill was used for making displaced fractures in the narrow femoral neck, with the femoral head kept in situ with ligamentum teres intact. In Group A, the fracture was immediately reduced and fixed with 3 parallel pins; while the operation was done 3 days later in Group B, and 3 weeks later in Group C. Another 2 dogs had their fractures untreated. Postoperatively, all dogs were fed separately and received regular x-ray examination. Left femoral heads were harvested for histological examination with a postoperative follow-up of 3.5 months. Results: The canine model of femoral neck fractures could be achieved successfully. Radiological signs of post-fracture ONFH could not be detected at intervals of 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 1 month and 12 months. Histologically, there were 2 cases with ONFH in Group A, 1 case in Group B, and 2 cases in Group C. The difference had no statistical significance. For untreated fractures, obvious ONFH could be found radiologically. Conclusions: A shorter ISI may not reduce the incidence of fracture-induced ONFH, which suggests that intrinsic factors play an important role in the occurrence of ONFH.

The aim of this study is to examine the incidence and resolution of types of radial nerve palsy (RNP) in operative and nonoperative humeral shaft fracture populations.Materials and MethodsRadial nerve lesions were identified as complete (RNPc), which included motor and sensory loss, and incomplete (RNPi), which included sensory-only lesions. Charts were reviewed for treatment type, radial nerve status, RNP resolution time, and follow-up time. Descriptive statistics were used to document incidence of RNP and time to resolution. Independent-samples t-test was used to determine significant differences between RNP resolution time in operative and nonoperative cohorts.ResultsA total of 175 patients (77 operative, 98 nonoperative) with diaphyseal humeral shaft injury between 2007 and 2016 were identified and treated. Seventeen out of 77 (22.1%) patients treated operatively were diagnosed preoperatively with a radial nerve lesion. Two (2.6%) patients developed secondary RNPc postoperatively. Eight out of 98 (8.2%) patients presented with RNP postinjury for nonoperatively treated humeral shaft fracture. All patients who presented with either RNPc, RNPi, or iatrogenic RNP had complete resolution of their RNP. No statistically significant difference was found in recovery time when comparing the operative versus nonoperative RNPc, operative versus nonoperative RNPi, or RNPc versus RNPi patient groups.ConclusionsAll 27 (100%) patients presenting with or developing radial nerve palsy in our study recovered. No patient required further surgery for radial nerve palsy. Radial nerve exploration in conjunction with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) appears to facilitate speedier resolution of RNP when directly compared with observation in nonoperative cases, although not statistically significantly so. These findings provide surgeons valuable information they can share with patients who sustain radial nerve injury with associated humerus shaft fracture or nonunion.Level of evidenceLevelIII treatment study.

Return to Duty Following Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Unstable Ankle Fractures in the Active Duty Population	MILITARY MEDICINE			English	Article								Introduction: Literature on functional outcomes after ankle surgery is for the most part limited to return to sport studies. The purpose of this study was to determine occupational and functional outcomes following operative treatment of unstable ankle fractures in the active duty military population. Materials and Methods: All ankle fractures treated with open reduction internal fixation at a single institution from 2013 to 2015 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria included active duty personnel with a single-sided injury requiring operative management. All patients had a minimum of 6 months follow-up. Forty-seven records were reviewed with 43 patients fitting these criteria. Patients were predominantly male (91%) with an average age of 26 years at the time of fracture. Functional outcomes were evaluated using AOFAS and SANE scores. Occupational outcomes were determined in reference to a service member's ability to return to full duty. Results: Of the 43 subjects, 81% (n = 35) returned to active duty. Of the eight individuals who did not return to active duty, six were medically boarded out of the military. Looking at demographic, surgical, and functional variables, only the SANE and AFAOS scores functional outcomes showed a significant correlation with individual return to duty. Individuals who reported less pain and increased functional outcomes had increased return to duty rates. Conclusion: This study sought to determine predictors for return to duty within an active duty military population after ORIF of unstable ankle fractures. Given the paucity of military literature on this subject, the end goal was to provide realistic recovery expectations for both injured service members and their command teams. Overall, 81% of patients were able to return to active duty following operative treatment of unstable ankle fractures. There were no associations found between age, gender, military rank, or fracture patterns and return to duty.

Materials and methods Nineteen patients with a mean age of 61 years (range 49-78 years) and a dorsally displaced distal radial fracture were treated using a palmar placed 2.4 mm interlocking plate system. All 17 women and 2 men were followed up according to the study protocol. Standardised radiographs in anteroposterior and lateral projection were performed before reduction and at 2, 6, 12 and 24 weeks after surgery. Radiological measurements included palmar tilt, radial inclination and radial shortening as defined by ulnar variance and intra-articular steps. Clinical assessment included active range of motion (ARM) of the wrist, pain according to a visual analogue scale (VAS), grip power, working ability, Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand-Score (DASH Score) and Mayo Wrist Score. Results At final follow-up after a minimum of 11 months, the palmar tilt was +1 degrees, radial inclination 19.8 degrees and ulnar variance 1.0 mm. Mean loss of palmar tilt measured 1.9 degrees, radial inclination 1.3 degrees and ulnar variance 0.4 mm. Mean wrist extension measured 58 degrees, wrist flexion 41 degrees, pronation 83 degrees and supination 84 degrees. The Mayo Wrist Score showed 21% excellent, 58% good, 16% fair and 5% poor results. Conclusion The treatment of unstable, dorsally dislocated, distal radius fractures AO types A3, C1 and C2, with a palmar placed 2.4 mm interlocking plate system and without additional treatment of the metaphyseal defects showed good radiological and functional results with minimal loss of reduction.

Emphasis is placed on the analysis of patients with poor functional outcome due to postsurgical complications. Material and Methods Evaluation of all patients operated at one level 1 trauma centre with a proximal humerus fracture in the period 01.01.2005 to 31.12.2015 and follow-up using validated scores (Constant-Murley Score [CMS], EQ-5 D). Two groups, group A with good outcome (Delta CMS <= 15 P.) and group B with poor outcome (Delta CMS >= 16 P.), were defined. Furthermore, descriptive variables including definition of a complication were defined in advance. Results: 138 patients were included in the study (group A: 91, group 8: 47). The mean follow-up was 93.86 months +/- 37.33 (36-167). Group B had significantly more complications. Furthermore, patients with poor outcome regarding the shoulder (group B) were also found to have significantly lower EQ-VAS (78.9 +/- 19.2 [20.0-100] vs. 70.4 +/- 19.5 [15.0-98.0]; p = 0.008) and EQ index (0.91 +/- 0.14 [0.19-1.00] vs. 0.82 +/- 0.17 [0.18-1.00]; p < 0.001). Discussion In conclusion, in the present study, the patients with poor outcome of shoulder function in CMS have significantly lower overall quality of life after a mean of more than 6 years of follow-up. The poor outcome was due to a significantly higher postoperative complication rate. This was independent of the fracture morphology present and the surgical procedure used.

Vancouver B2 and B3 periprosthetic femoral fractures treated by ORIF. Mid to long-term follow- up study in 28 patients	EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Periprosthetic femoral fractures; Vancouver classification system; Open reduction and internal fixation; Locking compression plate	TOTAL HIP-ARTHROPLASTY; FEMUR; RISK; CLASSIFICATION; RELIABILITY; MANAGEMENT; REVISION; VALIDITY	OBJECTIVE: Periprosthetic femoral fractures (PFF) are a serious complication in patients who have undergone hip arthroplasty. Some authors consider revision arthroplasty as the gold standard in the surgical treatment of Vancouver type B2 and B3 PFF. Others, however, prefer treating PFF by open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), without revising loose stems, especially in elderly patients. In the present retrospective study, we report mid/long-term results in a series of patients affected by B2 or B3 PFF surgically treated by ORIF, using a locking compression plate ( LCP), thus avoiding the need of revision arthroplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed 28 patients affected by B2 or B3 PFF surgically treated between 2010 and 2017 by ORIF using a LCP, after an average follow-up of 5.5 years. The average age of the patients at diagnosis was 78 years; in 17 patients, the femoral stem was uncemented while in 11, cemented. The mean interval time between hip arthroplasty and PFF was 6.7 years. Clinical results were assessed using Harris Hip Score (HHS), while radiographic results according to Beals and Tower criteria. RESULTS: At follow-up, HHS ranged from 72 to 96 points; 8 patients had an excellent result, 12 got a good result and 8 a fair result. According to Beals and Tower criteria, all the radiographic results were excellent (9 patients) or good (19 patients). The majority of our patients returned to their previous ambulatory levels. CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, in elderly patients affected by Vancouver type B2 or B3 PFF, surgical treatment by ORIF using a locking compression plate, without a stem revision, seems to be associated with satisfactory outcome.

Bioabsorbable anterior cervical plating - Initial multicenter clinical and radiographic experience	SPINE			English	Article						anterior cervical discectomy; bioabsorbable; cervical; fusion; plate; polymer	POLY(L-LACTIDE) BONE PLATES; FIXATION; DISKECTOMY; TITANIUM; IMPLANTS; FUSION; LEVEL	Study Design. Prospective clinical trial. Objective. The authors present their initial multicenter experience in the surgical management of 1-level degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine with anterior cervical discectomy and fusions (ACDF) using a bioabsorbable polymer plate. Summary of Background Data. The introduction of a radiolucent bioabsorbable polymer plate and screws for ACDF presents a novel opportunity to gain the some of the potential added benefit of stabilization with internal immobilization while possibly reducing some of the long-term complications and imaging artifacts associated with titanium instrumentation. We prospectively analyze 52 patients who were treated at 6 different institutions across the United States with bioabsorbable polymer plate and screws for ACDF surgery. Methods. Patients were prospectively enrolled. A retrospective review of patients' charts and imaging was performed to determine clinical and radiographic outcome following anterior cervical spine surgery. Specifically, the authors looked at need for additional surgeries, local reaction to bioabsorbable polymer, fusion rate, and complications. Surgeries involved the C4-C5, C5-C6, C6-C7, and/or C7-T1 levels. Cadaveric bone was used in 42 patients, polyetheretherketone ( PEEK) cages in 6 patients, and iliac crest autograft in 4 patients. The patients were observed for an average of 13.3 months. Results. Radiographic fusion was achieved in 98.1% ( 51 of 52 patients) of the cases at 6 months. One patient has evidence of nonunion on flexion-extension imaging but remains asymptomatic. A different patient developed mild kyphosis after surgery and had persistence of radicular symptoms but refused further surgery. There were no clinical signs or symptoms of reaction to the bioabsorbable material. Conclusions. The rates of fusion following single-level ACDF with internal fixation using bioabsorbable polymer plate and screws in this study match those previously reported in the literature with metallic implants and are superior to noninstrumented fusions. Preliminary results suggest that this newly available technology for anterior fusion may be as effective as traditional titanium plating systems in single-level disease. The bioabsorbable material appears to be well tolerated by patients. A larger, randomized, controlled study is necessary to bring the results to statistical significance.

Soc Francaise Chirurg Orthopedique	Hemiarthroplasty versus reverse shoulder arthroplasty in 4-part displaced fractures of the proximal humerus: Multicenter retrospective study	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Fracture; Hemiarthroplasty; Reverse shoulder arthroplasty; Cephalotuberosity fracture; 4-part fracture	FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES; FIXATION	Introduction: Complex 4-part fractures of the proximal humerus are one of the most difficult fractures to manage. For several years, reverse total arthroplasty (RSA) has been proposed as an alternative to hemiarthroplasty (HA) when internal fixation is insufficient. The goal of this study was to compare the short and intermediate term results of these 2 different types of arthroplasty. Materials and methods: In a retrospective, multicenter study, 57 HA and 41 RSA were reviewed after a follow-up of at least 2 years. The clinical evaluation was based on the absolute and adjusted Constant scores, Simple shoulder value (SSV) and the quick-DASH scores. The radiological assessment included standard radiological tests. Results: After a mean follow-up of 39 months, the RSA group had a significantly higher adjusted Constant score than the HA group (83% vs 73%, respectively P = 0.02). However, there was no significant difference in the absolute Constant score, the quick-DASH or the SSV scores. Active anterior elevation was better in the RSA group, while internal rotation was better in the HA group (130 degrees vs 112 degrees, P = 0.01; sacrum vs L3, P = 0.03). There was no significant difference in external rotation (28 degrees vs 23 degrees, P = 0.31). The rate of complications was higher in the HA group than in the RSA group (24% vs 10%, P = 0.01). The radiological rate of union of the greater tuberosity was similar in both groups (70%) and scapular notching was found in 23% of the RSA group. Conclusion: The short and intermediate term clinical outcomes are better with RSA than with HA. The complication rate is higher with HA. Nevertheless, scapular notching occurred in more than 20% of patients with RSA, suggesting that care should be taken when using this prosthesis in young, active patients.

Complications in the treatment of mandibular condylar fractures: Surgical versus conservative treatment	ANNALS OF ANATOMY-ANATOMISCHER ANZEIGER			English	Article						Bone; Mandible; Mandibular condyle; Fracture; Therapeutics	RETROMANDIBULAR TRANSPAROTID APPROACH; RIGID INTERNAL-FIXATION; CLOSED TREATMENT; OPEN REDUCTION; FOLLOW-UP; DISLOCATED FRACTURES; CLINICAL-EVALUATION; HEAD FRACTURES; OUTCOMES; SYSTEM	Objectives: In the present article, we aim to review the main intra-and post-operative complications associated with two different therapeutic approaches for treating mandibular condylar fractures: conservative (CTR) and surgical treatment (ORIF, Open Reduction and Internal Fixation). Material and methods: We have carried out a retrospective, meta-analytic, observational study using literature review, covering the period between 2000-September 2017. The data obtained were processed using statistical software SPSS v.0.18 and R v.2.11.1. The chi-squared test was used for comparison of relative frequencies for independent samples. Results: A total of 2458 patients with 2810 fractures were collected for study. Patients treated with CTR and ORIF were an average of 29 years old, of those treated with CTR, 72.37% and 27.63% were male or female respectively and, of those treated with ORIF, 70.36% and 29.64% were male or female respectively. The main complications suffered by CTR and ORIF patients were: asymmetry (10.2%/6.4%), residual pain (6.5%/5.6%), temporomandibular joint and articular imbalance (15.9%/10.3%) and malocclusion (11.1%/4.0%), respectively. We only found significant differences between CTR and ORIF in the number of cases of temporomandibular joint and articular imbalance and malocclusion. Facial nerve damage was found exclusively among ORIF patients (8.6%) of which 8.3% were temporary and 0.3% permanent. Conclusions: The complications associated with either technique are minimal and infrequent, resulting in successful outcomes with minimal morbidity. CTR are associated with complications deriving from delayed mobilization leading to functional limitation, whereas the main complication associated with ORIF treatment was facial nerve damage.

Total shoulder arthroplasty for proximal humerus fracture is associated with increased hospital charges despite a shorter length of stay	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Proximal humerus fracture; Hemiarthroplasty; Total shoulder arthroplasty; Cost; Length of stay	COST-EFFECTIVENESS; HEMIARTHROPLASTY; OUTCOMES; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PROSTHESIS; PATHWAY	Background: Operation choice is a complex decision in the surgical management of proximal humerus fractures. Recently, there has been an increase in the use of total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) for complex fracture patterns. Hypothesis: Patients with proximal humerus fractures who receive TSA are more likely to have higher hospital charges and a prolonged length of stay relative to patients receiving hemiarthroplasty (HA), open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) or closed reduction with internal fixation (CRIF). Materials and methods: A statewide electronic database was used to identify 13,316 hospital admissions from 2000-2011 were a proximal humerus fracture was surgically managed in an effort to determine the effect of operation choice on cost and length of stay. A univariate analysis was preformed to examine overall trends in surgical management. Additionally, a periodic, multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine how operation choice affected the odds of a high cost hospital stay or a prolonged length of stay after controlling for age, comorbidity burden, gender, and insurance type. Results: After controlling for confounding factors, patients receiving total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) were 2.25 times more likely to have high total hospital charges than patients receiving HA and 3.21 times more likely than patients receiving ORIF. Additionally, TSA was found to be a significant negative predictor of prolonged length of stay (pLOS). HA, ORIF and CRIF did not significantly predict pLOS. Discussion: The use of TSA for acute proximal humerus fractures is associated with increased hospital costs despite a shorter length of stay when compared to other operative choices. As reverse total shoulder arthroplasty becomes more popular for treatment of this injury, it is important that functional outcomes be interpreted in the context of relative cost trade-offs.

Outcomes of bipolar radial head prosthesis to treat complex radial head fractures in 22 patients with a mean follow-up of 50 months	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Radial head; Prosthesis; Arthroplasty; Bipolar; Fracture	MASON TYPE-III; INTERNAL-FIXATION; ELBOW INSTABILITY; COMMINUTED FRACTURES; JUDET PROSTHESIS; LIGAMENT REPAIR; REPLACEMENT; ARTHROPLASTY; STABILITY; EXCISION	Background: Radial head replacement is indicated to treat complex proximal radial fractures that are not amenable to internal fixation. Hypothesis: Implantation of a bipolar radial head prosthesis after radial head excision ensures stability of the elbow and forearm, thereby promoting ligament healing and restoring elbow function. Material and methods: Twenty-two patients managed with implantation of a bipolar radial head prosthesis (Guepar (R)) were evaluated after a mean follow-up of 50 months. The procedure was performed in the acute setting in 16 patients, including 13 with associated injuries; and at the stage of sequelae in 6 patients. Results: Prosthesis removal was required in 4 patients. Of the remaining 18 patients, 14 (77%) had satisfactory Mayo Elbow Performance Score values, 14 (77%) little or no functional impairment, and 11 (61%) little or no pain. Mean motion arcs were 100 degrees in flexion-extension and 143 degrees in pronation-supination. Mean elbow strength in flexion and mean wrist strength were 67% and 86%, respectively, of those on the contralateral normal side. Radio-lucent lines were visible around the prosthesis in 5 patients, radial neck osteolysis in 10 patients, and capitellar erosion in 7 patients. Seven patients each experienced a complication. Early revision surgery to treat elbow instability was required in 6 patients. Discussion: Outcomes after Guepar (R) bipolar radial head prosthesis implantation were disappointing inpatients with complex radial head fractures seen in the acute or chronic setting. The associated injuries to bones and ligaments and the measures taken to repair them influence the prognosis. The complication rate is non-negligible and seems to increase over time.

Background To assess and compare the clinical outcomes of posterior unilateral limited laminectomy (ULL) or bilateral laminectomy (BL) debridement and bone grafting fusion combined with internal fixation among aged patients with single-segment thoracic and lumbar tuberculosis (SST/LTB). Materials and methods We performed a retrospective study on aged patients (age > 65 years old) with SST/LTB from January 2010 to October 2018. We reviewed 36 aged patients who were treated with BL and 31 aged patients treated with ULL. All participants had undergone and finished a three-year follow-up. The outcomes were evaluated by the improvement of neurological function, correction Cobb angle, bone fusion time, and back pain, as well as operative time, blood loss, hospital stay, and postoperative complications. Results The operative time, blood loss volume, and incidence of complications in group B were significantly less than those in group A (P < 0.01). The postoperative kyphotic angle in both groups was reduced significantly compared to the preoperative status (P < 0.01). The percentage of neurological improvement was 92.9% in group A and 90.9% in group B. All patients achieved solid bone fusion after surgery. At three-year follow-up, the angle loss in group B was significantly less than that in group A (P < 0.01); Furthermore, patients in group B had a lower average visual analog scale score of back pain and Oswestry Disability Index score than patients in group A (P < 0.05). Conclusions For aged patients with SST/LTB, ULL is a safer and more effective surgical treatment than BL.

Characteristics and management of teeth in the line of mandibular fractures treated with internal fixation	DENTAL TRAUMATOLOGY			English	Article						computed tomography; dental injuries; mandibular fractures; third molar	ANGLE FRACTURES; 3RD MOLARS; RETENTION; INJURIES; TOOTH	Background/Aims The ideal management of teeth in the line of mandibular fractures is unclear and controversial. The aim of this study was to analyze the characteristics and management of teeth in the line of mandibular fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation. Material and Methods Medical records of patients with mandibular fractures in the symphysis, body and angle regions seen between July 2019 and January 2021 were evaluated. Personal data, etiology, location of fractures, characteristics of the teeth involved in the fracture lines and management were collected. The relationship between the fracture lines and the periodontium was classified according to Kamboozia & Punnia-Moorthy. Fractures were divided into two groups according to the management of the tooth in the fracture line: removal and retention. The likelihood ratio test was used (p < .050). Results During the study period, 52 patients with mandibular fractures were seen, of which 42 patients (83.3% men) with a mean age of 29.6 years and 54 fractures were included. The most frequent location was the angle of the mandible (41.3%) (p < .001). The removal group represented 35.2% of the fractures, and the retention group represented 64.8%. The most frequently removed tooth was the third molar (p < .001), and the most frequent classification of dental involvement in the fracture line was type II (p = .047). There was no correlation between age, gender, or etiology and the management of the teeth involved. Conclusion The retention of teeth in the fracture line predominated, and the third molar in angle fractures was the most often removed tooth when the fracture line followed the root surface but did not cross the apical region, probably due to the greater frequency of this type of relationship between the fractures and the periodontium.

Limited evidence exists regarding the treatment of hinge fractures after DFO, which could improve stability and thus bone healing.Purpose: To (1) examine the effect of hinge fractures on the biomechanical properties of the bone-implant construct, (2) evaluate the biomechanical advantages of an additional fixation of a hinge fracture, and (3) test the biomechanical properties of different types of varisation DFOs.Study Design: Controlled laboratory study.Methods: A total of 32 fresh-frozen human distal femora equally underwent medial closing wedge DFO or lateral opening wedge DFO using a unilateral locking compression plate. The following conditions were serially tested: (1) preserved hinge; (2) hinge fracture along the osteotomy plane; (3) screw fixation of the hinge fracture; and (4) locking T-plate fixation of the hinge fracture. Using a servo-hydraulic materials testing machine, we subjected each construct to 15 cycles of axial compression (400 N; 20 N/s) and internal and external rotational loads (10 N center dot m; 0.5 N center dot m/s) to evaluate the stiffness. The axial and torsional hinge displacement was recorded using a 3-dimensional optical measuring system. Repeated-measures 1-way analysis of variance and post hoc Bonferroni correction were used for multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was set at P < .05.Results: Independent from the type of osteotomy, a fractured hinge significantly (P < .001) increased rotational displacement and reduced stiffness of the bone-implant construct, resulting in >= 1.92 mm increased displacement and >= 70% reduced stiffness in each rotational direction, while the axial stiffness remained unchanged. For both procedures, neither a screw nor a plate could restore intact rotational stiffness (P < .01), while only the plate was able to restore intact rotational displacement. However, the plate always performed better compared with the screw, with significantly higher and lower values for stiffness (+38% to + 53%; P < .05) and displacement (-55% to 272%; P < .01), respectively, in >= 1 rotational direction. At the same time, the type of osteotomy did not significantly affect axial and torsional stability.Conclusion: Hinge fractures after medial closing wedge DFO and lateral opening wedge DFO caused decreased bone-implant construct rotational stiffness and increased fracture-site displacement. In contrast, the axial stiffness remained unchanged in the cadaveric model.Clinical Relevance: When considering an osteosynthesis of a hinge fracture in a DFO, an additional plate fixation was the construct with the highest stiffness and least displacement, which could restore intact hinge rotational displacement.

Posterior bending (maximum 50 N), axial loading (maximum 200 N) and internal rotation (maximum 10 Nmiddotm) were tested, in that order, for each specimen. Stiffness under different biomechanical settings among different configurations were compared. Another 18 sets of fracture models were created using these three configurations (n = 6 in each group) and the load to failure under axial loading among different configurations was compared.Results: Under posterior bending, the stiffness of parallel group was higher than orthogonal group (P < 0.001), and orthogonal group was higher than PPMS group (P < 0.001). Under axial loading, the stiff-ness of parallel group was higher than orthogonal group (P = 0.001) and PPMS group (P < 0.001); however, the difference between orthogonal and PPMS group was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Under inter-nal rotation, the stiffness of parallel group was higher than orthogonal group (P = 0.044), and orthogonal group was higher than PPMS group (P = 0.029). In failure test under axial loading, the load to failure in the orthogonal group was lower than parallel group (P = 0.009) and PPMS group (P = 0.021), but the differ-ence between parallel group and PPMS group was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). All specimens in orthogonal group demonstrated "distal medial failure"; most specimens had "distal medial and trochlear failure" in the parallel group; most specimens exhibited "contact failure" in the PPMS group.Conclusion: For treating low transcondylar fractures, the overall stiffness and strength of the parallel configuration were superior to those of the orthogonal and PPMS configurations. Nevertheless, the PPMS configuration can provide adequate stability and stiffness comparable to double-plate configurations un-der axial loading. Therefore, the PPMS construct may have certain clinical value.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Materials and Methods: A 3-dimensional model was constructed containing 3 implants with a conventional anatomical prosthesis (G1). The second model with the same implant system received the simplified prosthesis (G2). A load of 300 N was applied at an axial point and a nonaxial point through finite element analysis software. Results: The G2 group showed different values of stress concentration in the prosthesis, fixation screw, retention screw, and abutments when compared with G1. Within a limit of 10% degrees of acceptability, the stress on the implants and the bone strain were enclosed for both models of prostheses. Conclusion: The simplified fixed prosthesis evaluated presents biomechanical behavior similar to an anatomical prosthesis in the implants and in the surrounding bone structure.

Can reverse shoulder arthroplasty in post-traumatic revision surgery restore the ability to perform activities of daily living?	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Reverse shoulder arthroplasty; Revision; Outcome Failed arthroplasty; Failed osteosynthesis; Marker-based system; Upper extremity; Biomechanical model; Functional testing; Activity of daily living	DAILY-LIFE; MOTION; ELBOW; HAND	Background: Failed shoulder arthroplasty and failed internal fixation in fractures of the proximal humerus can benefit from implantation of a reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RSA). While there is some evidence that RSA can improve function regarding range of motion (ROM), pain, satisfaction, and strength, there is sparse data how this translates into activities of daily living (ADLs). A marker-based 3D video motion analysis system has recently been designed that can measure changes of ROM in dynamic movements in every plane. The hypothesis was that a gain of maximum ROM also translates into the ability to perform ADLs and into a significant increase of ROM in ADLs. Materials and methods: Six consecutive patients (5 women, 1 man; 2x failed arthroplasty, 4x failed open reduction and internal fixation) who received RSA were examined the day before and 1 year after shoulder replacement. A 3D motion analysis system using a novel upper extremity model measured active maximum values and ROM in four ADLs. Results: Comparing the pre- to the 1-year postoperative status, RSA resulted in a significant increase in mean maximum values for active flexion (humerus to thorax) of 37 degrees (S.D. +/- 23 degrees), from 50 to 87 degrees [P=0.005], and for active abduction averaging of 17 degrees (S.D. +/- 13 degrees), from 52 to 69 degrees [P=0.027]. The extension decreased significantly by about 8 degrees (S.D. +/- 16 degrees), from a mean of 39 to 31 degrees [P=0.009]. For active adduction and internal and external rotation, there were trends for improvements, but no significant changes. Only three additional tasks of the ADL (out of 13124 preoperatively) could be performed after revision surgery. Comparing the preoperative to the postoperative ROM in the ADLs in flexion/extension, ROM improved significantly in one ("tying an apron") of four ADLs. There were no significant changes in the abduction/adduction and internal/external rotation in any ADLs. Conclusion: RSA in revision cases significantly improved maximum active flexion and abduction, but decreased extension in this series. However, the patients were only able to use this greater ROM to their benefit in one of four ADLs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.	[Maier, M.

Nowadays, such threads can be made of metallic materials such as magnesium, zinc or alloys based on these metals. In current paper, manufacturing technology of biodegradable surgical threads of Mg-Ca alloys and of pure Zn was developed and basic properties of the obtained product have been characterized. The influence of in vitro corrosion in bovine serum simulating environment in the mammal's body on the surgical threads mechanical properties was determined. It was found that Zn and hot extruded alloys MgCa0.9 and MgCa1.2 can be recommended as a candidate for the future study in vivo. Properties of the room temperature drawn wires of the alloy MgCa0.7 are not sufficient for its application as surgical threads.

Hollow MOPs (H-MOPs) were prepared by template synthesis through the Sonogashira-Hagihara coupling of tetra(4-ethynylphenyl)methane with 1,4-diiodobenzene. The H-MOPs were used as platforms in the PSM-based functionalization. The heat-treatment of H-MOPs in the presence of a neat pinacolborane reagent resulted in the successful addition of pinacolborane groups to the internal alkynes of H-MOPs, generating H-MOPs with pinacolboranes (H-MOP-BPs). The pinacolborane moieties in the H-MOP-BP were further converted to boronic acid groups. The resultant H-MOP-BAs were used as heterogeneous organocatalysts in the CO2 fixation with epoxides to cyclic carbonates at ambient temperature (50 degrees C). Moreover, H-MOP-BAs could be recycled with retention of the catalytic performance in five successive reactions.

TREATMENT OF DISTAL FOREARM FRACTURES IN CHILDREN	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article						Distal forearm; distal radius; fracture; closed reduction; immobilization; internal fixation		Background and Aims: Distal forearm is the most common fracture location in the growing skeleton. The aim of this article is to describe the current practice of these fractures. Materials and Methods: Case series accompanied by experts' opinion. Results and Conclusion: Most of these injuries are benign incomplete distal metaphyseal torus fractures best treated with a dorsal below elbow splint for 2-3 weeks with no follow-up. Completely displaced metaphyseal fractures in prepubertal children can be either immobilized in bayonet position after axial alignment or fixed with K-wires after reduction. Complete fractures of distal metaphysis in adolescents should heal in near anatomic alignment because remodeling is uncertain. We advocate reduction of most greenstick and complete fractures at the distal metaphyseal diaphyseal junction and radiographic follow-up to monitor fracture alignment. Physeal fractures in adolescents and intra-articular fractures in children of all ages should be anatomically reduced. We perform most of our osteosyntheses with K-wires.

With strong acidity and a large amount of toxic impurities, PG is difficult to reuse. In this study, the solidified body (PG-S) was made by mechanical compression of the mixture of PG, copper smelting slag (CSS), CaO, NaOH, and water. Results indicate that the composition of the material phases in the PG-S samples changed with hydrated calcium silicate and amorphous silicate derivatives were formed during the reaction; Fe and Ca in the material were transformed; and the prepared geopolymer material had a dense internal structure with the materials being cemented to each other. The highest compressive strength of PG-S cured for 28 days could reach 21.3 MPa with a fixation efficiency of PO(4)(3-)and F(-)reaching 99.81 and 94.10%, respectively. The leaching concentration of heavy metals of the PG-S cured for 28 days met the requirements of the Comprehensive Wastewater Discharge Standard (GB 8978-1996). The simulation results of the geochemical model verified the feasibility of the whole immobilization process from the thermodynamic point of view. This work directly uses copper smelting slag and phosphogypsum for coupled immobilization/stabilization treatment not only to achieve the immobilization of pollutants in both solid wastes but also to obtain colloidal masses with certain compressive strength, which also provides a new option for resource utilization of phosphogypsum and copper smelting slag. This work also shows great potential in turning the actual mine backfill into cementitious material.

Male sex, Gustillo-Anderson type III open fracture and definitive external fixation are risk factors for a return to the or following the surgical management of geriatric low energy open ankle fractures	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Open ankle fracture; Comorbid patient; Obesity; Retrograde hindfoot nail; External fixation; Geriatric	FRAGILITY FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; COMPLICATIONS; PRESCRIPTION; LIMB	Introduction: Open ankle fractures in geriatric (age > 60 years) patients are a source of significant morbidity and mortality. Surgical management includes plate and screw fixation (ORIF), retrograde hindfoot nail (HFN), definitive external fixation (ex-fix) and below knee amputation. However, each modality poses unique challenges for this population. We sought to identify predictors of unplanned OR and short-term mortality after geriatric open ankle fractures managed by our service. Materials and methods: In an IRB-approved protocol, we evaluated patients over 60 years of age managed for a low energy open ankle/distal tibia pilon fracture by trauma fellowship-trained surgeons from a single academic department that covers two level I trauma centers. Our primary outcome was an unplanned return to the OR. Secondary outcomes were a 90-day "event", defined as an all-cause hospital readmission or mortality, and 1-year mortality. Differences with a p-value < 0.1 measured on univariate analysis were evaluated using a multivariable logistic regression to identify independent outcome predictors. Results: A total of 113 (60 ORIF, 36 HFN, 11 ex-fix, 6 amputations) were performed. Cohort mean age was 75.2 +/- 9.8 years, and 31 patients (27.4%) were male. Mean age-adjusted charlson comorbidity index was 5.5 +/- 2.0. Significant independent predictors of an unplanned return to the OR were male sex (OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 15.4), Gustilo Type III open fracture (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.5 to 17.5) and ex-fix (OR 15.6, 95% CI 2.7 to 126.3). Independent predictors of a 90-day "event" were walker/minimal ambulation (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 10.4), surgical site infection (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.8 to 13.8) and reduced BMI (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.9 - 0.99), while independent predictors of 1-year mortality were age (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.003 to 1.2), ACCI (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.0) and walker/minimal ambulator (OR 7.5, 95% CI 1.7 to 53) Conclusions: Host factors, particularly pre-operative mobility, were most predictive of 90-day event and 1-year mortality. Only definitive external fixation was found to influence patient morbidity as a significant predictor of unplanned OR. However, no surgical modality had any influence on short-term readmission or survival. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We evaluated whether a postoperative wedge shoe would increase our non-union rate. Materials and Methods: Nineteen adult female patients (27 feet; eight bilateral, five simultaneous) undergoing a first tarsometatarsal arthrodesis for hallux valgus associated with a hypermobile first ray or for recurrent hallux valgus were managed postoperatively by allowing them to bear weight in a wedge shoe instead of a cast. Radiographs were evaluated for signs of fusion. Results: All 27 feet went on to successful union after 6 to 24 weeks. There was one superficial wound infection and one case of recurrence of the hallux valgus. Conclusion: Based on our results, we allow adult patients undergoing a Lapidus type procedure to be managed in a postoperative wedge shoe.

Material/Methods: Ten patients undergoing either ankle (5) or distal radius (5) open reduction and internal fixation received single-injection ropivacaine sciatic nerve block or infraclavicular brachial plexus block and catheter. Infusion pumps were set to begin administering additional ropivacaine 6 h following the initial block as automated boluses supplemented with patient-controlled boluses. Results: Patients had similar pain scores when compared to previously published controls; however, local anesthetic consumption was lower in the patients, resulting in increased infusion and analgesia duration by 1 or more days in each group. Conclusions: For infraclavicular and popliteal sciatic catheters, automated boluses may provide a longer duration of analgesia than continuous infusions following painful hand and ankle surgeries, respectively.

In this study, the multifunctional lactide oligomers having 2, 3, and 4 arms end capped with methacrylate groups were synthesized with the aim of improving the degradation properties. Their composites with hydroxyapatite (HA) were photopolymerized and subjected to accelerated degradation at 60 degrees C. The results showed that increasing number of arms significantly improved thermal and mechanical properties as well as biocompatibility of the composites. All composites although varying in number of arms had similar levels of bone-specific gene expression and calcification indicating their equal bioactivity in supporting bone formation. The high HA content in the composites was proposed to be responsible for enhanced osteoblast response, and this tended to suppress the effects of polymeric structure.

Different types of BiOX (X = Br, Cl and I) materials were combined to optimize the charge separation of prepared heterogeneous junction so as to improve the photocatalytic performance. It had been proved by various char-acterization methods that the charge carrier recombination would be greatly suppressed under the action of internal electric field at the interface when n-p-n heterojunction was formed. Specially, 20-Bi4O5I2-Bi2O2CO3-BiOCl0.8I0.2 presented the best photocatalytic performance, which could degrade 99% of Rhodamine B (RhB) in 60 min under 500 W Xe lamp source. BiOCl0.8I0.2 improves the performance of photocatalytic and broaden the light absorption range of pure BiOI.

Several analogies with the physiology of Staphylococcus aureus, a more thoroughly investigated pathogen, have lead to carefully consider all bacterial surface components that mediate cell adhesion. This study aimed at investigating the presence of the fbe gene encoding for a fibrinogen-binding protein in a collection of 107 S. epidermidis strains isolated from orthopaedic infections and 67 from central venous catheter-associated infections. The strains isolated from orthopaedic infections were in large part associated to four different classes of orthopaedic devices, respectively: internal fixation devices. external fixation devices, knee arthroprostheses and hip arthroprostheses. The molecular epidemiology analysis performed by PCR enlightened a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of this adhesion mechanism between orthopaedic infections and catheter-related infections, respectively. of 78% and 91%. The prevalence of fbe ranged from 67% to 91%. suggesting that. even though this adhesin is not strictly necessary for the development of infection, nevertheless it represents a rather common characteristic of strains causing clinical infections, this independently on the presence or the absence of implant materials.

The material of the study consisted 19 dogs of medium-large size, which were brought to Ankara University, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology because of injuries due to various trauma and consequent diaphyseal femur fractures clinically and radiologically. Following general anaesthesia, the broken extremity was operated, a total of 20 interlocking pins of different sizes were placed. Among the pins used with an appropriate diameter and length, 10 were 8-199 mm, 4 were 8-185 mm, 2 were 8-172, 1 was 8-165, 2 were 6-172 mm and another was 6-160 mm, respectively. In order to lock these pins 46, 3.5 mm diameter screws, with different length were used. It was observed that 1 screw in proximal and 1 screw in distal region, didn't hold in the holes of the pins. Statical nailing was performed in all cases but one. Cases were clinically examined for weight bearing and extremity usage and radiologically, the callus tissue development was monitored. As a result; the idea was that interlocking nailing technique was on alternative to plates by creating enough rigidity, to fixate 1/3 diaphyseal femoral fractures in medium and medium-large breed dogs.

J	Illert, T; Rammelt, S; Drewes, T; Grass, R; Zwipp, H				Illert, Till; Rammelt, Stefan; Drewes, Tim; Grass, Rene; Zwipp, Hans			Stability of Locking and Non-Locking Plates in an Osteoporotic Calcaneal Fracture Model	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Calcaneus; Fracture; Locking Plate; Non-Locking Plate; Biomechanical Properties	2 FIXATION METHODS; INTERNAL-FIXATION; INTRAARTICULAR FRACTURES	Background: The aim of this biomechanical cadaver study of calcaneal fractures was to investigate whether a locking calcaneal plate provides more stiffness in osteoporotic bone compared to a non-locking plate. Materials and Methods: Sixteen fresh frozen bone mineral density (BMD)-matched cadaver feet were tested in a four-part model of a Sanders Type IIB calcaneal fracture. The fractures were fixed either with a non-locking AO (Sanders) plate or an interlocking AO plate (Synthes, Paoli, PA) to the lateral calcaneal wall with six screws. Specimens were subjected to cyclic loading which was increased stepwise to full body weight. Displacement of the posterior facet fragment was measured with an optical tracking system in the sagittal and transverse planes. Results: No statistically significant differences were observed between the non-locking and the locking plates with respect to number of cycles to failure or 1-mm displacement of the posterior facet. The initial stiffness was significantly higher for non-locking plates. Conclusion: In osteoporotic bone, the greater stiffness of the screw-locking-plate construct was offset by the smaller diameter of the screw threads and the lower friction between the plate and bone when a locking plate was used. In clinical practice, the plate should first be compressed to osteoporotic bone with cancellous screws and at least two screws should be placed in the anterior process and in the tuberosity of the calcaneus.

Currently, optimal fracture fixation devices with osteoinductivity, mechanical compatibility, and corrosion resistance are urgently needed for clinical practice. Niobium (Nb), whose mechanical properties are similar to those of bone tissue, has excellent biocompatibility and corrosion resistance, so it has the potential to be the most appropriate fixation material for internal fracture treatment. However, not much attention has been paid to the use of Nb in the area of clinical implants. Yet its role and mechanism of promoting fracture healing remain unclear. Hence, this study aims at elucidating on the effectiveness of Nb by systematically evaluating its osteogenic performance via in vivo and ex vivo tests.Methods: Systematic in vivo and in vitro experiments were conducted to evaluate the osteogenic properties of Nb. In vitro experiments, the biocompatibility and osteopromoting activity of Nb were assessed. And the osteoinductive activity of Nb was assessed by alizarin red, ALP staining and PCR test. In vivo experiments, the effectiveness and biosafety of Nb in promoting fracture healing were evaluated using a rat femoral fracture model. Through the analysis of gene sequencing results of bone scab tissues, the upregulation of PI3K-Akt pathway expression was detected and it was verified by histochemical staining and WB experiments.Results: Experiments in this study had proved that Nb had excellent in-vitro cell adhesion and proliferation -promoting effects without cytotoxicity. In addition, ALP activity, alizarin red staining and semi-quantitative analysis in the Nb group had indicated its profound impact on enhancing osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. We also found that the use of Nb implants can accelerate fracture healing compared to that with Ti6Al4V using an animal model of femur fracture in rats, and the biosafety of Nb was confirmed in vivo via histological evaluation. Furthermore, we found that the osteogenic effects of Nb were achieved through activation of the PIK/Akt3 signalling pathway.Conclusion: As is shown in the present research, Nb possessed excellent biosafety in clinical implants and accel-erated fracture healing by activating the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway, which had good prospects for clinical translation, and it can replace titanium alloy as a material for new functional implants.

Multiple and comminuted mandibular fractures: Treatment outlines in adverse medical conditions in Iraq	JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article						mandibular fracture etiology; mandibular fracture treatment modality; mandibular fracture complications		This study was conducted to evaluate prospectively the simple and more reliable methods in the treatment of multiple and comminuted mandibular fractures in hospitals with limited facilities and a high influx rate of trauma patients such as ours in Baghdad. One hundred patients with multiple and comminuted mandibular fractures of different severities were included in this study. Fifty-four patients were with comminuted and 46 were with multiple mandibular fractures. Eighty-eight patients had isolated mandibular fractures, and 12 had other associated facial bones fractures. Seventy-two patients were treated solely with maxilloman-dibular fixation. Thirteen patients were treated with different methods of internal fixation; the remainder was treated conservatively, functionally, or with different combinations of closed and open reduction methods. There was a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) for fractures healing in relation to the type, severity, and etiology of the fracture. Eighty-four patients had fractures healed to bony union, 4 ended with nonunited fractures, and 10 patients had bone loss. Four patients developed infection, thus the infection rate! was 4% for all, and 2.17% and 5.56% for patients with multiple and comminuted fractures, respectively. Seventeen patients required further surgeries for facial recontouring. The results of this study underscore the efficacy of closed reduction for treating multiple and comminuted mandibular fractures in terms of its simplicity, the availability, of materials and instruments, and the favorable outcomes.

Self-Reinforced Bioresorbable Polymer P (L/DL) LA 70:30 for the Manufacture of Craniofacial Implant	POLIMEROS-CIENCIA E TECNOLOGIA			English	Article						Biomaterials; bioabsorbable polymers; self-reinforcing; bone implant	IN-VITRO; DEVICES	The importance of self-reinforced bioabsorbable polymers has been growing due to their use in orthopedic and dental implants. Bioabsorbable polymeric implants manufactured only by the processes of injection or extrusion without the post processing of self-reinforcing leave a great deal on presenting an appealing alternative in terms of the mechanical strength suitable for use in the fixation of bone fractures. One of the most promising ways to promote the increase of mechanical properties of bioresorbable polymers is through the self-reinforcing technique. Self-reinforcing occurs when the internal structure of the polymer is strongly oriented in the direction of the deformation. Knowing the levels of mechanical strength obtained is essential to determine the sites of application of the component. The objective of this work was to study the method and the influence of self-reinforcing conditions, such as reduction ratio, temperature and deformation speed, on the quality and mechanical properties of small cylindrical bars obtained from the bioresorbable polymer P (L/DL) LA 70:30. The different processing conditions led to distinct levels of mechanical strength. Resistance values obtained in this work are the highest ever recorded for this material. It is important to stress that the values of mechanical strength achieved are within the limits accepted as safe for utilization in the fixation of craniofacial fractures, a fact that significantly enhances the prospects in this area.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1989 and 2005,16 consecutive patients with arterial damage after orthopedic surgery (seven women, nine men; mean age, 62 years; age range, 21-82 y) underwent angiographic exploration. Seven patients were in hemodynamically unstable condition. Initial orthopedic procedures were iliac crest internal fixation (n = 1); total hip prosthesis (n = 3); revision of total hip prosthesis (n = 4); revision of acetabular cup prosthesis (n 1); gamma-nailing, nail-plate fixation, or intramedullary nailing (n = 3); and total knee prosthesis (n = 4). RESULTS: Angiography showed pseudoarteurysms (n = 11), vascular lacerations with active extravasation (n = 3), and arteriovenous fistulas with extravasation (n = 2). After angiographic documentation of serious arterial injury, 14 patients were treated with a single or coaxial catheter technique in combination with coils alone, coils and polyvinyl alcohol particles, coils and Gelfoam pledgets, or Gelfoam pledgets; or balloon occlusion with isobutyl cyanoacrylate and coils. Two patients were treated with covered stents. In all, bleeding was effectively controlled in a single session in 16 patients, with immediate circulatory stabilization. Major complications included death, pulmonary embolism, and postprocedural hematoma. CONCLUSION: Selective and superselective catheter therapy may be used for effective, minimally invasive management of rare but potentially life-threatening vascular complications after orthopedic surgery.

This study is to investigate clinical results of fluoro-navigation surgery in anterior pelvic ring fractures. Materials and Methods: From January 2006 to October 2011, 23 patients with anterior pelvic ring fractures were treated with percutaneous cannulated screw under fluoro-navigation. Results: A total of 32 screws were inserted, including 19 in the pubic ramis and 13 in the anterior acetabular columns. The average surgical time was 23.3 min/screw. The average time of X-ray exposure was 19.1 2.5 s/screw. The virtual images of fluoro-navigation were compared with real-time X-rays during and after the surgery. Compared to the final position of the screw, the average deviated distance was 3.11 mm and the average trajectory difference was 2.81 degrees. Blood loss during the operation was minimal (22.3 ml/screw). One screw (3.1%) deviated out of the fracture site during the operation. No superficial or deep infection occurred. No patient sustained recognized neurologic, vascular, or urologic injury as a result of the percutaneous screw fixation. All fractures united at the last followup. Conclusions: Fluoro-navigation technique could become a safe, accurate, and fairly quick method for the treatment of anterior pelvic ring fractures. Standardization of the operative procedure and training are mandatory for the success of this procedure.

Forty-eight adult cadaver rib specimens were divided randomly into six groups: three fixation model groups were made using embracing plates (two pairs of equals on both sides of the broken end), and the other three groups were fixed with a pre-shaped anatomical plate (three locking screws on each side of the end were equally spaced). The biomechanical properties of these models were analyzed using non-destructive three-point bending tests, non-destructive torsion experiments, and destructive axial compression tests. In this study, the gap of fracture ends was widened in embracing plate group in the non-destructive three-point bending experiment. No change in the fracture ends was detected in the pre-shaped anatomical plate group. The bending stress of the pre-shaped anatomical plate group was significantly enhanced at the 2-12 mm displacement points (p < 0.05). Moreover, there was no significant difference in torque noticed between the two groups in the torsion experiment (p = 0.082). In the destructive axial compression experiment, the load index of the two groups were higher than the normal physiological load, suggesting that both materials could provide sufficient strength for rib fractures. The pre-shaped anatomical plate displayed more reliable attachment in terms of stability, bending, and load. Our results indicated that the embracing plate has the advantage of fretting at the fracture end.

MATERIAL AND METHODS 126 patients who were treated for tibial plateau fractures between 2008-2013 in the orthopedics and traumatology department of our institution were evaluated for the study. Patients were treated with open reduction and internal fixation, arthroscopy assisted minimally invasive osteosynthesis or conservative treatment. RESULTS Mean posterior tibial slope after the treatment was 6.91 +/- 5.11 and there was no significant difference when compared to the uninvolved side 6.42 +/- 4,21 (p = 0.794). Knee laxity in anterior-posterior plane was 6.14 +/- 2.11 and 5.95 +/- 2.25 respectively on healthy and injured side. The difference of mean laxity in anterior-posterior plane between two sides was statistically significant. DISCUSSION In this study we found no difference in laxity between the injured and healthy knees. However Tegner score decreased significantly in patients who had greater laxity difference between the knees. We did not find significant difference between fracture type and laxity, IKDC functional scores independent of the ligamentous injury. CONCLUSION In conclusion despite corona! alignment is taken into consideration in treatment of tibial plateau fractures, sagittal alignment is reasonably important for stability and should not be ignored.

Avoiding early complications and reoperation during occipitocervical fusion in pediatric patients	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS			English	Article						occipitocervical fusion; instrumentation; spine; craniovertebral junction; instability; pediatric; complications	BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN-2; RIGID INTERNAL-FIXATION; CLINICAL ARTICLE; SCREW FIXATION; ODONTOID FRACTURES; CERVICAL-SPINE; DENS FRACTURE; CHILDREN; INSTRUMENTATION; CONSTRUCT	Object. Surgical arthrodesis for pediatric occipitocervical (OC) instability has a high rate of success in a wide variety of challenging circumstances; however, identifying potential risk factors can help to target variables that should be the focus of improvement. The aim of this paper was to examine risk factors predictive of failure in a population of patients who underwent instrumented OC arthrodesis using a uniform surgical philosophy. Methods. The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients who underwent OC fusion from 2001 to 2013 at a single institution to determine risk factors for surgical failure, defined as reoperation for revision of the arthrodesis or instrumentation. The primary study outcome was either radiographic confirmation of successful OC fusion or surgical failure requiring revision of the arthrodesis or instrumentation. The secondary outcome was the underlying cause of failure (hardware failure, graft failure, or infection). Univariate analysis was performed to assess the association between outcome and patient demographics, cause of OC instability, type of OC instrumentation, bone graft material, biological adjuncts, and complications. Results. Of the 127 procedures included, 20(15.7%) involved some form of surgical failure and required revision Surgery. Univariate analysis revealed that patients with deep wound infections requiring debridement were more likely to require surgical revision of the hardware or graft (p = 0.002). Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with skeletal dysplasia or congenital spinal anomalies were more likely to develop hardware failure than patients with other causes of OC instability (p = 0.020). Surgical failure was not associated with the method of C-2 fixation, type of rigid OC instrumentation, bone graft material, use of bone morphogenetic protein or biological adjuncts, cause of instability, sex, age, or having previous OC fusion operations. Conclusions. Pediatric patients in the present cohort with postoperative wound infections requiring surgical debridement had higher surgical failure rates after OC fusion. Those with skeletal dysplasia and congenital spinal anomalies were more likely to require reoperation for hardware failure. Better understanding of the mode of surgical failure may enable surgeons to develop strategies to decrease the need for reoperation in pediatric patients with OC instability.

Material and Methods: The following were evaluated from clinical charts: damage control preoperative procedures, surgery, and pre-, intra-and post-operative complications; imaging was also evaluated from the preoperative assessment to the final follow-up (4 to 13.2 years; average 7.2 years). Results: One patient died a few days after surgery; therefore, long-term follow-up was possible in 10 patients. One of the 10 patients could be evaluated only radiologically because he was non-compliant due to severe mental illness. There were four early complications: one patient had a massive pulmonary embolism, which was fatal; one had wound dehiscence; one developed pulmonary infection and one had caecal fistula, which was repaired by the general surgeon. Late complications were as follows: three patients required hardware removal or substitution because of deep infection (after 1 year), system breakage (after 9 years) and screws loosening (after 7 years). Clinical evaluation was available in nine patients and was assessed using Oswestry forms and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). All patients were able to walk at least 1 kilometre without external support, two patients were using pain medication regularly and three patients were classified with severe disability at final follow-up. Degenerative changes in the joints close to the fused area were observed in two patients more than 10 years after the operation, but the correlation with surgery is questionable. Discussion: Lumbopelvic disjunctions generally follow high-energy trauma often involving internal thoracic and abdominal organs; therefore, a well-trained team approach is mandatory to preserve patient life and to provide adequate treatment of skeletal injuries. Mechanical complications may occur several years after surgery, thus a long-term follow-up is mandatory. Conclusions: Lumbopelvic fixation is an effective surgical technique for treatment of spinopelvic disjunction. The patient numbers in this series, and in the literature in general, are low; therefore, a multicentre study is advisable to give evidence and statistical importance to our findings.

Composite rods of u-HA/PLLA and c-HA/PLLA were implanted into the distal femurs of 25 rabbits. Four of these rabbits lived for more than 5 years after implantation, with one living for 7 years 4 months. Samples were retrieved after the rabbits died naturally and specimens were examined by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). For u-HA/PLLA, the shrinkage of the rods progressed further after 4 years, and some were almost completely resorbed. We could not find traces of the rod in some sections from more than 6 years. Remodeled bone encircled the residual material, and trabecular bone bonded directly to the rod was found toward the center. For u-HA/PLLA 30%, results were similar to u-HA/PLLA 40%, and the cross-sectional area had decreased by 4.0% at over 7 years. Most of the PLLA had been released from the rods. Neither obvious osteolytic nor osteoarthritic changes were found after 4 years. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Materials and Methods: A randomized controlled clinical trial of 40 patients with mandibular fractures was conducted. The patients were randomly allocated to the study and control groups, with 20 members each. A standardized surgical protocol was followed to manage the fractures by open reduction and internal fixation. After fixation, the study group received LIPUS stimulation (1.5 MHz, 30 mW/cm(2)) on postoperative days 4, 8, 14, and 20 for 20 minutes daily; the control group received no LIPUS stimulation. The outcome parameters assessed were postoperative pain, wound healing, teeth mobility, and radiographic and ultrasound fracture healing. Results: The study variables were analyzed using the independent samples t test or Mann-Whitney U test. The pain score was reduced in the study group on all postoperative days (P < .001). The mean amount of wound healing was better in the study group than in the control group on days 5 and 9 (P < .004 and P < .019, respectively). The mean score for the ultrasound assessment of fracture healing was greater in the study group, with a statistically significant difference. Conclusions: LIPUS application reduced postoperative pain and facilitated fracture healing in patients with compromised healing potential.

Replacement of the Condyle and Ascending Ramus by a Modular Endoprosthesis in <i>Macaca fascicularis</i>-Part 3: Evaluation of Pen-Implant Bone Remodeling	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY; INTERNAL-FIXATION PLATES; TOTAL HIP-ARTHROPLASTY; MANDIBULAR RECONSTRUCTION; MINERAL DENSITY; PROXIMAL FEMUR; STEM; INVIVO	Purpose: To assess whether the fixation of a condyle-ascending ramus mandibular modular endoprosthesis, using bone cement, will result in stress-related bone resorption in the Macaca fascicularis. Materials and Methods: The right condyle and ascending ramus were resected in 8 adult monkeys and replaced by a modular endoprosthesis, fixed with polymethylmethacrylate bone cement (Palacos). Four monkeys were sacrificed at 3 months and another 4 at 6 months postoperatively. The bone mineral density was assessed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in the region anterior to the stern and using micro-computed tomography in the buccal, lingual, and inferior regions adjacent to the stem. Results: The bone mineral density of the 3-month specimens was greater than that at 6 months in the buccal, lingual, and inferior regions adjacent to the stem. However, the difference was statistically significant only in the inferior aspect. No significant difference was found in the bone mineral density in the region anterior to the stem between the 3- and 6-month specimens. Conclusion: A minimal reduction in bone density around the stem of the endoprosthesis was observed between 3 and 6 months after placement. This reduction did not result in any adverse clinical events.

The purpose of this study was to assess human cervical spine pullout force after lateral mass fixation involving two different techniques: the Roy-Camille and the Magerl techniques. Although such comparisons have been conducted previously, because of the heterogeneity of results and the importance of this procedure in clinical practice, it is essential to have data derived from a prospective and randomized biomechanical study involving a sufficient sample of human cervical spines. The authors also evaluated the influence of the sex, the vertebral level, the bone mineral density (BMD), the length of bone purchase, and the thickness of the anterior cortical purchase. Methods. Twenty-one adult cervical spines were harvested from fresh human cadavers. Computerized tomography was performed before and after placing 3.5-mm titanium lateral mass screws from C-3 to C-6. Pullout forces were evaluated using a material testing machine. The load was applied until the pullout of the screw was observed. A total of 152 pullout tests were available, 76 for each type of screw fixation. The statistical analysis was mainly performed using the Kaplan-Meier survival method. The mean pullout force was 266 +/- 124 N for the Roy-Camille technique and 231 +/- 94 N for the Magerl technique (p < 0.025). For the C3-4 specimen group, Roy-Camille screws were demonstrated to exert a significantly higher resistance to pullout forces (299 +/- 114 N) compared with Magerl screws (242 +/- 97 N), whereas no difference was found between the two techniques for the C5-6 specimen group (Roy-Camille 236 122 N and Magerl 220 +/- 86 N). Independent of the procedure. pullout strengths were greater at the C3-4 level (271 114 N) than the C5-6 level (228 105 N) (p < 0.05). No significant correlation between the cancellous BMD, the thickness of the anterior cortical purchase, the length of bone purchase, and maximal pullout forces was found for either technique. Conclusions. The difference between pullout forces associated with the Roy-Camille and the Magerl techniques was not as significant as has been previously suggested in the literature. It was interesting to note the influence of the vertebral level: Roy-Camille screws demonstrated greater pullout strength (23%) at the C3-4 vertebral level than Magerl screws but no significant difference between the techniques was observed at C5-6.

MATERIAL and METHODS: A retrospective study was performed. The data of 22 patients with consecutive multi-level thoracic tuberculosis and kyphosis who underwent the one-stage posterior approach of debridement, bone grafting, drainage and pedicle screws fixation were collected. The kyphotic angle was 61.6 degrees +/- 3.1 degrees pre-operatively. The neurologic status based on American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scoring was A in 5 cases, B in 4 cases, C in 9 cases, D in 3 cases and E in 1 case. RESULTS: The average follow-up period was 43.4 +/- 5.0 months. The kyphotic angle was 19.8 degrees +/- 0.7 degrees after operation (p<0.01), and 21.9 degrees +/- 1.2 degrees at the last visit (p<0.01). No neurological deterioration was observed in any patients after surgery. A significant difference in ASIA score was detected when the state before the operation and at the last visit was compared (p<0.01). There was no recurrent paravertebral abscess of thoracic tuberculosis in any of these cases. CONCLUSION: The one-stage posterior approach of debridement and drainage is a feasible surgical option for consecutive multisegment thoracic tuberculosis with kyphosis. It can achieve debridement, decompression, and stabilization simultaneously.

Material: The study included 32 patients with unstable oblique infected mandibular fractures (23 males and 9 females), with a mean age of 33 years. The patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 were treated with an osteosynthesis plate (with at least 3 screws on each side of fracture sites) applied to the mandibular fracture site, while in group 2 the bone plate was applied (2 screws on each side of fracture sites) with maxillomandibular fixation (MMF). Clinical and radiographic examinations were carefully assessed preoperatively and postoperatively at follow-up intervals of 1, 2, 6, 12 months. Postoperative complications in terms of dysocclusion, wound dehiscence and neurosensory disturbances were examined. Result: Postoperative clinical and radiographic results showed that group 1 had quicker bone generation and more precise anatomical alignment of fracture sites than with those in group 2. All patients showed no evidence of infection, plate fracture or exposure, malunion. osteomyelitis, neurosensory disturbances, or dental injury. Conclusion: The 2.3 mm reconstruction bone plates provide excellent stability and healing of the unstable infected mandibular fractures provided that the fracture site is fixed by at least 3 screws on each side of the fracture sites.

Materials and Methods To determine the factors influencing the clinical outcomes of in situ osteosynthesis in non-displaced femoral neck fractures in the elderly, radiographs and clinical data of patients were retrospectively analyzed. The subjects were 49 patients with femoral neck fractures (Garden stages I and II), who underwent osteosynthesis, with correctly inserted screws and with more than 2 years of follow up. The relationships between preoperative anteroposterior X-ray parameters including Garden stage, the presence or absence of spikes, the Singh grade, the Garden alignment index, the degree of impaction at the fracture site (the capital impaction index) and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. Results Among the 49 cases, there were eight unsuccessfully treated patients, two with non-union and six with late segmental collapse. The "without spikes" fracture type (P < 0.05) and the degree of capital impaction when the capital impaction index (P < 0.0001) was greater than the mean plus the standard deviation, were significantly associated with unsuccessful outcomes. Conclusion Excessive shortening at the fracture site on the anteroposterior radiograph in the femoral neck fracture of Garden stages I and II can be used to predict poor outcomes from in situ osteosynthesis.

Study performed on 45 consecutive patients	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Capitellar and trochlear fracture; Elbow fracture; Posterior comminution; Coronal plane fracture; Shear fracture	INTERNAL-FIXATION; ARTICULAR FRACTURES; OPEN REDUCTION	Introduction: Only few case series of capitellar and trochlear fractures have been reported. Some of them assume that the presence of a posterior comminution (type B according to Dubberley classification) can represent a negative risk factor for treatment and prognosis respect to the type A cases (without posterior comminution). Nevertheless, how this parameter impacts the treatment and the prognosis has never been quantified before. Materials and methods: All the capitellar and trochlear fractures treated from 2007 to 2015 have been retrospectively reviewed. The presence of posterior comminution on a pre-operative CT-scan was correlated to the surgical technique, to the timing of initiation of rehabilitation and to clinical outcomes. Results: 45 Consecutive patients have been selected, 17 not presenting a posterior comminution (type A), and 28 with posterior comminution (type B). In all the type A fractures a lateral approach (Kocher o Kocher extensile) was used and the fragment fixation was always performed using only screws. Elbow replacement or olecranon osteotomy were performed only to treat type B fractures. Augmented fixations, using plates and k-wires, or prosthetic replacement have been used only in type B fractures. The post-operative immobilization was significantly inferior for type A fracture. Better results have been obtained in type A fractures: mean MEPI score was 86 in type A and 73 in type B, the range of motion was significatively higher in type A both in flexion-extension and in pronation-supination. In type B fractures a significant higher number of complications have been observed (64% vs 29%) along with more reoperations. Discussion: The study has confirmed that, even without considering the extension of the fracture on the coronal plane, the presence of posterior comminution represents an evident negative risk factor, influencing the surgical approach and treatment, the fixation technique, the post-operative rehabilitation, the clinical outcomes, the complications and re-operation rates. Conclusions: The analysis of the present case series shows how the treatment and the outcomes can be significantly anticipated based on the presence or absence of posterior comminution. Patients with type A fracture are more likely treated with a Kocher approach, screw fixation, an early rehabilitation is performed. In type A fractures better outcomes and low complications rate are expected. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Clinical picture could be devastating due to severe neurological deficits which lead the patients dependent both socially and emotionally. Materials and methods: This study compared two groups of patients who were operated because of thoracolumbar burst fracture secondary to spinal trauma in terms of neurologic deficits, degree of improvement, and radiologic measurements at one-year follow-up. The first group (group I) included the patients who underwent posterior total laminectomy, peroperative reduction of intracanal bone fragments, and posterior spinal instrumentation and the second group (group II) included the patients who underwent total laminectomy, and spinal instrumentation without reduction of free bone fragments. Results: Neither group showed significant correlation with any measurement parameter. Radiological assessments and clinical improvements did not disclosed significant difference between the two groups at one-year follow-up. Conclusion: Retropulsion of free bone fragments extend the time of surgery and causes complications. This study found that there is no need to retropulse the bone fragments in the spinal canal in patients with unstable burst fractures who underwent total laminectomy and posterior long segment stabilization.

Bone Joint Trauma Study Grp GETRAU	Treatment of nonunion in neglected long bone shaft fractures by osteoperiosteal decortication	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Nonunion; Shaft; Decortication; Fracture fixation	NON-UNIONS; FEMUR	In emerging countries, nonunion in the shaft of fractured long bones is common. Patients and methods: In a 3-year long prospective study, 50 patients (38 men, 12 women) with an average age of 40.9 years (range 17-60) were treated for neglected diaphyseal nonunion an average of 11 months (range 6-48) after the fracture event. The femur was involved 14 times, tibia 22 times, humerus eight times and forearm bones six times. All of these patients had consulted initially with a traditional bone setter at the time of fracture. The surgical procedure consisted of osteoperiosteal decortication followed by repermeabilization of the medullary canal and then internal fixation. Compression plating was used for the humerus, radius and ulna. Nonunion of the middle-third of the femur and tibia was treated by intramedullary nailing and nonunion of the proximal third of the femur with an inverted DCS screw-plate. Patients were reviewed clinically and with X-rays on postoperative days 21, 45, 90 and 120. Results: Bone union was obtained in under 90 days in the upper limb and under 120 days in the lower limb. No additional grafting was needed. There were only two cases of leg length differences. Discussion: Osteoperiosteal decortication is a reliable technique that leads to predictable, satisfactory results, given the limited materials required to treat long bone nonunion in emerging countries.

Screw failures such as pullout and breakages have been reported during the past several years of research and development in this field. Further, the rate of revision surgeries due to failed pedicle screws is around 2-12%. This creates unavoidable hardship to the patients. Improper screw size for revision surgery can lead to complications such as pedicle fractures, screw pullout, or reduced stability of the fusion construct. We performed pullout strength studies on five osteoporotic lumbar vertebra and a rigid polyurethane foam block to find the effect of the outer diameter of revision screws as per American Standards for Testing of Materials (ASTM) 543-07 protocol. The present study revealed that whereas the use of revision screws that were one millimeter greater in diameter than the original screws decreased the pullout strength by 79% in the foam model, the pullout strength increased by 121% when the original index screws were replaced with screws that were two millimeters greater in diameter. The effect of revision screw diameter on pullout strength was significant (p < 0.05). Cadaveric testing reveals a trend that agrees with the foam model tests. (C) 2019 IPEM.

Twelve fresh-frozen porcine tibias with a 1-cm gap created distal to the tibial plateau were used to simulate an unstable proximal tibial fracture. All specimens were fixed with a periarticular proximal lateral tibial locking plate and divided into 2 groups based on whether the proximal metaphyseal screw holes of the plate were inserted with either cannulated locking screws or noncannulated cortical locking screws. An axial compressive load was applied to cause failure in each specimen using a materials testing instrument. The axial stiffness and maximum failure strength in axial loading were recorded. Axial stiffness of the constructs using noncannulated cortical locking screw was significantly higher than that of the constructs using cannulated locking screws (P=.006). Axial failure strength of the constructs using noncannulated cortical locking screw was significantly higher than that of the constructs using cannulated locking screws (P=.002). The failure mode observed in all specimens was a permanent screw-bending deformity over the head-shaft junction of proximal metaphyseal screws, irrespective of whether they were cannulated or noncannulated cortical locking screws. Fixation with noncannulated cortical locking screws offered more stability than cannulated locking screws with regard to axial stiffness and failure strength in a porcine model with unstable proximal tibial fractures.

Since 1970, operative treatment has been recommended. Unfortunately, it is fraught with complications, and techniques have been developed to limit incidence of non-union, infection and stiffness. A soft-tissue friendly approach is the key point, with minimally invasive surgery as the ultimate goal: its biological and anatomical advantages have been demonstrated, but clinical studies have been less convincing, being based on historical series. At present, retrograde nailing and minimally invasive percutaneous plate osteosynthesis (ideally by locking plate) are the two main techniques. Unfortunately, reports tend to compare implants rather than operative techniques, hindering solid conclusions. Lastly, the delineation of "distal femur fracture" is quite variable, sometimes situated well above the AO epiphyseal square. Meta-analyses find almost no difference between the two implants in minimally invasive procedures. The main advantage of the plate is its versatility, whereas nailing can be impossible in case of certain hip or knee prostheses, compound articular fracture or medullary canal obstruction by fixation material (nail, stem, screw, etc.). The role of arthroscopy is limited. Only a few case reports describe its use in reduction of epiphyseal fracture. In the last analysis, the surgeon's experience is more relevant to outcome than any particular implant. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Treatment of select open calcaneus fractures with reduction and internal fixation: An intermediate-term review	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							HINDFOOT	Background: Open calcaneal fractures are devastating, high-energy injuries frequently occurring in multiply-injured patients. Unsatisfactory outcomes with significant complications rates are frequently reported. Our purpose was to assess outcomes of delayed ORIF for open calcaneal fractures with medial hindfoot wounds and limited posterior facet comminution. Materials and Methods: Following acute management of the open fractures, seven patients were determined to have stable medial hindfoot wounds and posterior facet comminution of three or fewer fracture fragments. The average age was 32.5 years. These patients were treated with operative management with a plate-and-screw construct using the extensile lateral approach. RAND-36 Item Health, AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Survey, and physical examinations were undertaken to access outcomes. Results: All open calcaneal injuries were initially treated with irrigation and debridement, intravenous antibiotics, and plaster immobilization. Definitive fixation was performed at an average of 11.7 days. Six of seven patients were multiply injured. Prior to injury, five were employed on a full-time basis. Four returned to their original or a comparable job. The results of the RAND-36 Item Health Survey and the AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot scores were 56.7 and 71, respectively. There were no postoperative infections. No patients required additional operative hindfoot procedures. Five continued to use tobacco products. None reported chronic narcotic usage. Conclusion: Aggressive treatment of select open calcaneal fractures with delayed ORIF produced satisfactory functional results. Most patients were able to return to gainful employment. There were no infections or wound complications.

Beside bone quality, the design of a screw influences inter-fragmentary compression. Compressive force is achievable for any kind of screw system; however, the primary deformation of the bone is different for the different screw systems. The work necessary to achieve compressive force for primary stability was measured for different screw systems and compared to an AO screw with washer. Materials and Methods: The compressive force was determined as a function of screw advancement for 3 different cannulated screw types (7.3-mm AO screw with and without washer, the 6.5-mm Herbert screw and the 6.5-mm Ideal Compression Screw (I.CO.S) using different synthetic bone density (0.16, 0.24, 0.48 g/ccm). Compressive force was measured indirectly, via screw tension measurement with strain gauges. Results: We calculated the work to reach a limit of 60 N and the corresponding ratios to the value of the golden standard: I.CO.S (35.2%), Herbert (89.0%), AO screw without washer (116%). Conclusion: All screw systems yielded acceptable results but the ICOS did produce greater compresion. The essential differences were the primary deformation of the bone before reaching the sufficient compressive force for primary stability.

Bone plates are a method of internal fixation that allows the correction of single or bilateral fractures, simple or comminuted; which appropriate material and technical knowledge for their use. Recent studies have demonstrated the superior strength that the locked plates present in relation to the neutralization plates, especially when used in flat bones or with lower bone density. The present study aimed to evaluate the biomechanical strength of neutralization plates and locked plates in oblique mandibular fractures in dogs. Sixteen hemimandibles from mesocephalic dogs were selected, weighing between 15 and 25 kg, without mandibular pathological alterations. Unfavorable fractures were performed between the 2nd and 3rd premolar teeth. The hemimandibles were allocated to two groups and stabilized with neutralization (Group 1) and locked (Group 2) plates. Both groups were subjected to the vertical compression test using the EMIC DL500 machine, sought to note the difference of maximum resistance between the implants. The statistical analysis used was the t-test and showed no difference (P = 0.135) between the strength of the group receiving neutralization plates (21.08 +/- 9.766kgf) and the group that received locked plates (25.96 +/- 7.029kgf). From the point of view of resistance to vertical compression, the neutralized and locked plates have the same biomechanical strength.

Clinical outcomes of locked plating of distal femoral fractures in a retrospective cohort	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND RESEARCH			English	Article						Femur; Fracture; Supracondylar; Locked plating; Outcome	INVASIVE STABILIZATION SYSTEM; TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY; MECHANICALLY UNSTABLE FRACTURES; FEMUR FRACTURES; LOCKING PLATES; ORTHOPEDIC-TRAUMA; INTERNAL-FIXATION; CLASSIFICATION; COMPLICATIONS; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Purpose: Locked plating (LP) of distal femoral fractures has become very popular. Despite technique suggestions from anecdotal and some early reports, knowledge about risk factors for failure, nonunion (NU), and revision is limited. The purpose of this study was to analyze the complications and clinical outcomes of LP treatment for distal femoral fractures. Materials and methods: From two trauma centers, 243 consecutive surgically treated distal femoral fractures (AO/OTA 33) were retrospectively identified. Of these, 111 fractures in 106 patients (53.8% female) underwent locked plate fixation. They had an average age of 54 years (range 18 to 95 years): 34.2% were obese, 18.9% were smokers, and 18.9% were diabetic. Open fractures were present in 40.5% with 79.5% Gustilo type III. Fixation constructs for plate length, working length, and screw concentration were delineated. Nonunion and/or infection, and implant failure were used as outcome complication variables. Outcome was based on surgical method and addressed according to Pritchett for reduction, range of motion, and pain. Results: Eighty-three (74.8%) of the fractures healed after the index procedure. Twenty (18.0%) of the patients developed a NU. Four of 20 (20%) resulted in a recalcitrant NU. Length of comminution did not correlate to NU (p = 0.180). Closed injuries had a higher tendency to heal after the index procedure than open injuries (p = 0.057). Closed and minimally open (Gustilo/Anderson types I and II) fractures healed at a significantly higher rate after the index procedure compared to type III open fractures (80.0% versus 61.3%, p = 0.041). Eleven fractures (9.9%) developed hardware failure. Fewer nonunions were found in the submuscular group (10.7%) compared to open reduction (32.0%) (p = 0.023). Fractures above total knee arthroplasties had a significantly greater rate of failed hardware (p = 0.040) and worse clinical outcome according to Pritchett (p = 0.040). Loss of fixation was related to pain (F = 3.19, p = 0.046) and a tendency to worse outcome (F = 2.43, p = 0.071). No relationship was found between nonunion and working length. Conclusion: Despite modern fixation techniques, distal femoral fractures often result in persistent disability and worse clinical outcomes. Soft tissue management seems to be important. Submuscular plate insertion reduced the nonunion rate. Preexisting total knee arthroplasty increased the risk of hardware failure. Further studies determining factors that improve outcome are warranted.

Procedures varying from simple bone grafting to megaprosthesis revision have been described. We successfully managed such cases using our technique of combining cortical allograft struts to augment the defect in the femoral condyle coupled with autogenous iliac crest bone grafting and locking plate osteosynthesis. Materials and methods: Between April 2012 and May 2014, 22 patients who presented with resistant non-unions of the distal femur following initial surgery were managed using this technique. Cortical allograft struts were taken from the tissue bank of our institution. All patients were followed up post operatively and their time to union was noted. Functional outcome was calculated using LEFS (Lower extremity functional score). The average follow up of all our patients was 24 months. Results: All patients went on to achieve complete bony union. The average union time was 6.2 months (5 to 8 months). One patient who was a diabetic had superficial infection post operatively which was treated successfully with IV antibiotics. Average knee flexion was 110 degrees (80 to 130 degrees). The mean LEFS score was 72 (59 to 79). Conclusion: Combing a locking plate fixation with the bone grafting technique of using an allograft strut to support the metaphyseal medial bone defect and autografts gives a good union and a good functional outcome in the management of resistant non-unions of the distal femur by enhancing the biology and providing a good structural support to the distal femur.

However, there is no consensus regarding the methods for using autogenous bone grafts. The purpose of this retrospective study was to compare the clinical outcomes of anterior surgical management for cervical spine tuberculosis by using an iliac bone graft versus a structural manubrium graft. Methods From January 2009 to September 2018, 23 patients with cervical spine tuberculosis were treated with anterior debridement, autogenous structural bone grafting and fixation at our spinal department. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the different graft materials, namely, iliac crest bone grafts (Group A) and structural manubrium grafts (Group B). The clinical and radiographic results of the 2 groups were analyzed and compared. Results The mean duration of follow-up was 24 months. Bony fusion was achieved in all patients without failure of internal fixation. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to the operation time, blood loss, fusion time, neurological outcomes, or postoperative local Cobb angle (P > .05). However, the donor site complication rate in Group A was greater than that in Group B. The postoperative ambulation time in Group A was later than that in Group B. The mean visual analog scale (VAS) score for donor site pain in Group A was higher than that in Group B at 1 week after surgery (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups at the last visit (P > .05). Conclusion Both iliac bone grafts and sternal manubrium grafts can effectively reconstruct anterior column defects in anterior surgery. However, structural sternal manubrium autografts cause fewer complications associated with donor site morbidities than iliac bone grafts.

The purpose of this study was to compare results of operative (reduction internal fixation (RIF)) and nonoperative treatment (NOT) in patients with IUSF. Material and methods: A retrospective case-control analysis was undertaken on patients diagnosed with IUSF between 2002 and 2008 at a Level I teaching trauma center. Clinical outcomes consisted of complications and functional ability. Results: Seventy patients had a mean age of 44.6 years (18-86) and a body mass index (BMI) of 27.9 (17-47). The mechanism of injury included high-energy injuries (60/70, 85.7%), low-energy falls (8/70, 11.4%), and sports (2/70, 2.9%). Treatment consisted of 33/70 (47.1%) NOT and 37/70 (52.9%) RIF. The AO/OTA fracture classification was 48 A1, 20 B2, and two C1. The level of activity (LOA) was 60 without restrictions, six with restrictions, and three who did not return to work. The function determined by range of motion was 55/70 (78.6%) full, 11 slightly limited, and one severely limited. A total of 14 nonunions (NUs) and 17 malunions (MUs) occurred. NOT was associated with NU (chi(2) = 0.001) and MU (chi(2) = 0.000), respectively. Fracture angulation >= 8 degrees was related to the inability to return to previous LOA (rho = 0.406, p = 0.001). Secondary displacement >2 mm contributed to MU (R-2 = 0.238, p = 0.000) and NU (R-2 = 0.076, p = 0.021). NU was related to a minor functional result (rho = 0.315, p = 0.009). Conclusions: IUSF treatment remains challenging in the adult population. Nonoperative treatment of displaced fractures produces a high risk of complications, and the fracture characteristics determine patient outcome. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: Orthopaedic Trauma Association type 61-C1.3a2c5 fractures were created in 10 fresh frozen cadaveric pelvis specimens. Specimens were divided into two groups of five. In both groups, the anterior ring was stabilized with a six-hole 3.5-mm reconstruction plate. In the locked plate (LP) group, the posterior injury was stabilized using a two-hole locking plate with one solid 5.0-mm locking iliosacral screw directed onto the S1 body and a second locking screw directed into the lateral sacral ala. In the iliosacral screw group, the posterior injury was stabilized using a single cannulated 7.3-mm screw. Testing was conducted on a Materials Testing System. Values for displacement and rotation were recorded. Each pelvis was axially loaded with a compressive sine wave from 175 N to 350 N for 10,000 cycles to simulate limited weight bearing, with data recorded at 1,000 cycle increments. Results: Two specimens in the iliosacral screw group displaced more than 1 cm during the first 1,000 cycles. These two specimens displayed gross fracture motion in all planes. All five specimens in the LP group completed 10,000 cycles of testing with less than 1 cm of displacement. A vector displacement calculation from the plane displacement data revealed that the LP group had significantly less displacement (median 1.9 mm) than the specimens in the iliosacral group (median 6.7 mm; p = 0.008) after 10,000 cycles. Conclusions: A two-hole plate locked head screw construct resulted in less displacement than a single iliosacral screw in a transforaminal sacral fracture model.

A 35-year-old male who sustained femoral shaft open fracture with large bone loss was treated using with the minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis technique. Heterotopic bone began to appear 6 weeks postoperatively around the fracture site near bone defect area. This heterotopic bone was used to treat femoral shaft bone defect as autogenous bone graft. The proper timing of heterotopic bone removal to avoid recurrence remains controversial. It has not been reported whether heterotopic bone can be used as autogenous bone graft material to treat bone defect. We describe a simple method to treat large bone defects of the femoral shaft combined with heterotopic bone formation after treatment for femoral shaft fractures with large bone loss using the heterotopic bone as bone graft material. This method will be especially useful for cases that have both long bone defects of the femoral shaft and ectopic bone formation as well as quadriceps entrapment due to ectopic bone.

In this study, a new medical magnesium alloy was fabricated and analyzed, with aim of providing a basis for the development of degradable magnesium alloys. Based on previous medical and metallurgical studies, a Mg-Zn-CaY alloy with three different elemental ratios was designed, synthesized, and characterized. Their main composition was a-Mg, and they also contain other phase peaks, such as Mg24Y5. The differences in the contents of the alloy samples resulted in differences in their mechanical properties and biological properties. In general, alloy III exhibited the best properties. The hemolytic characteristics, cytotoxicity and antibacterial activity of the alloy samples were determined through in-vitro experiments while their histocompatibility and osteogenic properties were evaluated through in-vivo tests. The in-vitro tests showed that alloys II and III did not exhibit obvious hemolysis and cytotoxicity while the in-vivo experiments showed that these alloys exhibited good histocompatibility and osteogenic properties, with alloy III showing better characteristics than those of alloy II. Thus, alloy III should be highly suitable for use as an orthopedic internal fixation material.

This paper presents the use of this system exclusively in patients with AO33 distal femoral fractures, a group in which fracture management is often complicated by multiple trauma and soft-tissue damage. Materials and methods A series of 62 patients (mean age 52 years) with 66 AO33A or C fractures received the LISS implant and were followed prospectively for 12 months. Assessments included the radiographic evaluation of implant placement and healing, measurement of valgus/varus and sagittal joint malalignment, and the assessment of weight-bearing capacity and range of motion. Results The mean duration of surgery was 85 min (range 40-135 min) for 33A fractures and 149 min (range 50-300 min) for 33C fractures. Postoperative radiographic assessments showed that the LISS implant was positioned correctly in 59 cases (89%). Assessment of valgus/varus alignment showed correct axial alignment in 49 cases (74%), a deviation of 5-10 degrees in 13 cases, and a 10-20 degrees deviation in 1 case. Correct sagittal alignment was observed in 56 cases (85%), 5-10 degrees malalignment in 5 cases, and 10-20 degrees in 2 cases. During the course of the 1-year follow-up, 8 patients (9 fractures) died; 2 other patients were not available for follow-up. Complete fracture healing was achieved in 85% of the followed-up patients. Forty-eight patients were capable of full weight-bearing. After fracture healing, maximum flexion of the injured limb was on average 80% of the range of the uninjured limb. An extension deficit of more than 5 degrees was measured in 3 cases. Of the 62 patients, 14 underwent further operations during the course of follow-up. Of these, 6 required bone grafting and 3 refixation of the implant due to implant loosening. Deep infections requiring several debridements occurred in 2 patients. No complications relating solely to the implant were observed. Conclusion The LISS showed good overall results in the treatment of these difficult fractures. It is a good alternative to conventional extramedullary and intramedullary stabilizing techniques, especially in more complex fracture situations.

The Functional Consequence of Syndesmotic Joint Malreduction at a Minimum 2-Year Follow-Up	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC TRAUMA			English	Article						syndesmosis; malreduction; outcome	UNSTABLE ANKLE FRACTURES; TIBIOFIBULAR SYNDESMOSIS; INTERNAL-FIXATION; SCREW FIXATION; DISRUPTIONS; DIAGNOSIS; DIASTASIS; INJURIES	Objective: To examine the correlation between syndesmotic malreduction and functional outcome. Design: Prospective evaluation of bilateral computed tomography scans and functional outcome scores. Setting: Level I regional trauma center. Materials and Methods: From January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2006, 107 of 681 operatively treated ankle fractures (15.7%) had associated syndesmotic injuries requiring reduction and fixation. All patients available at a minimum of 2 years postindex procedure underwent clinical and radiographic examination, computed tomographic (CT) scanning of both ankles (injured and uninjured), and functional outcome scoring using the Short Form Musculoskeletal Assessment and Olerud/Molander questionnaires. Results: Sixty-eight of 107 (63.5%) syndesmotic injuries in 68 patients were available for follow-up. Twenty-seven (39%) were malreduced (rotational or translational asymmetry) when compared with the contralateral uninjured syndesmotic joint. Fifteen percent of the open syndesmotic reductions were malreduced on postoperative CT scans, whereas 44% (A/B) of the closed syndesmotic reductions were malreduced on postoperative CT scan (P = 0.11). Patients with a malreduced syndesmosis recorded significantly worse functional outcome scores (P < 0.05) on both the Short Form Musculoskeletal Assessment and Olerud/Molander questionnaires when compared with those patients whose syndesmosis had healed in anatomic alignment. Conclusions: At a minimum of 2 years follow-up, patients with malreduced syndesmotic injuries demonstrated significantly worse functional outcome using the Short Form Musculoskeletal Assessment and Olerud/Molander questionnaires. Open reduction of the syndesmosis resulted in a substantially lower rate of malreduction when evaluated by postoperative CT scan. Based on these findings, we recommend that surgeons not only perform a direct, open visualization of the syndesmosis during the reduction maneuver, but obtain a postoperative CT scan with comparison to the contralateral extremity as well. If the syndesmosis is found to be malreduced, consideration must be given to revising the osteosynthesis.	[Sagi, H.

Materials and Methods: Firstly, the length of the pubic region, quadrilateral region, iliac region, and the total length of the DAPSQ trajectory were measured by a digital measurement approach in 22 complete pelvic specimens. Then, the results were compared with the direct measurement of pelvic specimens to verify the reliability of the digital measurement method. Secondly, 504 cases (834 hemilateral pelvis) of adult pelvic CT images were collected from four medical centers in China. The four DAPSQ trajectory parameters were obtained with the digital measurement method. Finally, the third-generation DAPSQ plate was designed, and its applicability was verified. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in the four trajectory parameters when comparing the direct measurement method with the digital measurement method (p > 0.05). The average lengths of the pubic region, quadrilateral region, iliac region, and the total length in Chinese population were (60.96 +/- 5.39) mm, (69.11 +/- 5.28) mm, (84.40 +/- 6.41) mm, and (214.46 +/- 10.15) mm, respectively. Based on the measurement results, six models of the DAPSQ plate including small size (A1,A2), medium size (B1,B2), and the large size (C1,C2) were designed. The verification experiment showed that all these six type plates could meet the requirement of 94.36% cases. Conclusions: A reliable computerized method for measuring irregular pelvic structure was proposed, which not only provided an anatomical basis for the design of the third-generation DAPSQ plate, but also provided a reference for the design of other pelvic fixation devices.

However, issues of loss of reduction and breakage of fixatives have not yet been resolved. In the current study, we describe a new technique for exposure and stabilization of comminuted patellar fractures and evaluate the clinical and radiologic outcomes of this new treatment. Materials and methods: Thirteen patellar fractures with articular comminution, which were treated by headless compression screws with additional separate vertical wiring were enrolled in this study. Loose articular fragments were fixed with headless compression screws under direct visual reduction of the articular surface, which was facilitated by the superior everting of the patella. Radiographs of the knee were obtained at routine follow-up to assess fracture healing and widening of articular step-off. Clinical outcomes including range of motion, quadriceps circumference, visual analog scale (VAS) related pain score, Lysholm, and Bostman grading scales were measured at the last follow-up. Results: All the fractures healed at a mean of 15 weeks. No patient had loss of reduction, evidence of implant migration, or metallic failure. Articular step-off larger than 2 mm was not seen in any of the cases. The average range of motion arc was 134.2 degrees (range, 120 degrees-145 degrees), and the mean Lysholm and Bostman scores were 94.4 (range, 84-100 points) and 28.7 (range, 25-30 points), respectively. Thigh muscle wasting was observed in four patients (33.3%), but no patient had > 1.5 cm difference in thigh circumference girth between the injured and uninjured lower limbs. The average VAS-related pain score was 0.4. Conclusions: Articular fixations with headless compression screws under direct visual reduction of the articular surface resulted in good clinical outcomes and were considered clinically effective for comminuted patellar fractures.(C) 2017 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association.

One method to enhance implant anchorage is implant/screw augmentation with PMMA-cement. The present study investigated the feasibility of implant augmentation with PMMA-cement to enhance implant anchorage in the proximal humerus. Materials and methods: A simulated three part humeral head fracture was stabilised with an angular stable plating system in 12 pairs of humeri using six head screws. In the augmentation group the proximal four screws were treated with four cannulated screws, each augmented with 0.5 ml of PMMA-cement, whereas the contra lateral side served as a non-augmented control. Specimens were loaded in varus-bending or axial-rotation using a cyclic loading protocol with increasing load magnitude until failure of the osteosynthesis occurred. Results: Augmented specimens showed a significant higher number of load cycles until failure than non-augment specimens (varus-bending: 8516 (SD 951.6) vs. 5583 (SD 2273.6), P = 0.014; axial-rotation: 3316 (SD 348.8) vs. 2050 (SD 656.5), P = 0.003). Non-augmented specimens showed a positive correlation of load cycles until failure and measured bone mineral density (varus-bending: r = 0.893, P = 0.016; axial-rotation: r = 0.753, P = 0.084), whereas no correlation was present in augmented specimens (varus-bending: r = 0,258, P = 0.621; axial-rotation r = 0.127, P = 0.810). Conclusion: These findings suggest that augmentation of cannulated screws is a feasible method to enhance implant/screw anchorage in the humeral head. The improvement of screw purchase is increasing with decreasing bone mineral density. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Functional Outcome After Operatively Treated Ankle Fractures in the Elderly	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Ankle Fractures; Elderly; Functional Outcomes	EPIDEMIOLOGY; FIXATION	Background: The goal of this review was to compare the functional outcomes of patients less than 60 and greater than or equal to 60 years old following operative stabilization of unstable ankle fractures. The review was conducted as a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data at two level one trauma centers and a tertiary referral academic center. Materials and Methods: All patients operatively treated for an unstable ankle fracture were entered into a database and prospectively followed. The postoperative protocol was standardized for all patients. Baseline characteristics, complications, additional surgery, functional status and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score (AOFAS) were assessed. The intervention chosen was open reduction and internal fixation of unstable ankle fractures. AOFAS hind-foot score and Short Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment (SMFA) questionnaire were used as the main outcome measures in the study. A p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Three hundred sixty-nine (369) patients were entered into the database, 313 (84.8%) were less than 60 years old. At 3 months, 57% (32/56) of patients greater than or equal to 60 years old reported limitation of activities versus 33% (1031313) of patients less than 60 years old (p = 0.005). At 6 and 12 months, these percentages improved to 41% versus 10% (p = 0.001), and 29% versus 7.4% (p = 0.001) for older and younger individuals respectively. However, when compared to their baseline scores, both groups achieved a return to pre-injury status. Total AOFAS scores were not significantly different at 3, 6, or 12 months (p = 0.431). Conclusion: Operative fixation of unstable ankle fractures in patients greater than or equal to 60 years old can provide a reasonable functional result at the 1-year followup with a return to preoperative baseline even though they report more limitation of activities than younger patients.

We aimed to compare the stress-shielding effects of locked compression plate (LCP) and limited-contact dynamic compression plate (LC-DCP) in dogs with plate-fixed femurs. Methods: Bilateral intact femurs of 24 adult dogs were fixed by adult forearm 9-hole titanium plates using minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPPO) technology, with LCP on the left and LC-DCP on the right femurs. Dogs were sacrificed at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after surgery, and bone specimens were used to evaluate the efficacies of different fixing methods on bones through X-ray, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), histology, MicroCT, and biomechanics analyses. Results: X-ray results showed significant callus formation and periosteal reaction in the LC-DCP group. Bone cell morphology, degree of osteoporosis, and bone mineral density (BMD) changes of the LCP group were significantly better than that of the LC-DCP group. MicroCT results showed that the LCP group had significantly reduced degree of cortical bone osteoporosis than the LC-DCP group. Tissue mineral density (TMD) in the LCP group was higher than that in the LC-DCP group at different time points (6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks). Biomechanics analyses demonstrated that the compressive strength and flexural strength of bones fixed by LCP were better than that by LC-DCP. Conclusions: Stress-shielding effects of LCP are significantly weaker than that of LC-DCP, which is beneficial to new bone formation and fracture healing, and LCP can be widely used in clinic for fracture fixation.

The cement augmentation of screws might facilitate improving implant anchorage. The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of cement augmentation of the condylar screws on implant fixation in a human cadaveric bone model. Material and methods: Ten pairs of osteoporotic femora (mean age: 90 years, range: 84-99 years) were used. A 2-cm gap osteotomy was created in the metaphyseal region to simulate an unstable AO/OTA 33-A3 fracture. All specimens were treated with a polyaxial locking plate. Specimens randomly assigned to the augmented group received an additional cement augmentation of the condylar screws using bone cement. A servohydraulic testing machine was used to perform incremental cyclic axial loading using a load-to-failure mode. Results: All specimens survived at least 800 N of axial compressive force. The mean compressive forces leading to failure were 1620 N (95% CI: 1382-1858 N) in the non-augmented group and 2420 N (95% CI: 2054-2786 N) in the group with cement-augmented condylar screws (p = 0.005). Deformation with cutting out of the condylar screws and condylar fracture were the most common reasons for failure in both groups. Whereas axial stiffness was comparable between both osteosyntheses (p = 0.508), significant differences were observed for the plastic deformation of the constructs (p = 0.014). Conclusion: The results of the present study showed that the cement augmentation of the condylar screws might be a promising technique for the fixation of distal femoral fractures in elderly patients with osteoporotic bones.

Risk factors for decreased range of motion and poor outcomes in open periarticular elbow fractures	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Open fracture; Elbow	OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM; DISTAL HUMERAL FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; HETEROTOPIC OSSIFICATION; EXTERNAL FIXATION; ENDURING FREEDOM; FLOATING ELBOW; CLASSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; INJURIES	Introduction: The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors present at the time of injury that predict poor functional outcomes and heterotopic ossification (HO) in open periarticular elbow fractures. Materials and methods: We performed a retrospective review of 136 combat-related open elbow fractures from 2003 to 2010. Patient demographics, injury characteristics, treatment variables, and complications were recorded. Functional outcomes were analyzed to determine range of motion (ROM) and Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS). Secondary outcome measures included the development of HO, return to duty, and revision operation. Results: At a median 2.7 years from injury the median MEPS was 67.8 (range 30-100) with an average ulnohumeral arc motion of 89 degrees. Bipolar fractures, with periarticular fractures on both sides of the elbow and at least one side containing intra-articular extension, were independently associated with decreased ulnohumeral motion (p = 0.02) and decreased MEPS (p < 0.004). Additional independent risk factors for decreased ROM included more severe osseous comminution (p = 0.001), and increased time to definitive fixation (p = 0.03) and HO (p = 0.02). More severe soft tissue injury (Gustilo and Anderson fracture type, p = 0.02), peripheral nerve injury (p = 0.04), and HO (p = 0.03) were independently associated with decreased MEPS. HO developed in 65% (89/136) of extremities and was associated with more severe Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA) fracture type (p = 0.01) and escalating Gustilo and Anderson fracture classification (p = 0.049). Conclusions: In the largest series of open elbow fractures, we identified risk factors that portend a poor clinical outcome and decreased ROM. Bipolar elbow fractures, which have not previously been associated with worse results, are particularly prone to decreased ROM and worse outcomes. Level of evidence: Prognostic level IV.

A Meta-Analysis on Comparison of Open vs Closed Reduction of Gartland Type 3 Supracondylar Humerus Fractures in Children	ACTA CHIRURGIAE ORTHOPAEDICAE ET TRAUMATOLOGIAE CECHOSLOVACA			English	Article						supracondylar humerus; open reduction; percutaneous pinning; Flynn criteria	INTERNAL-FIXATION; MANAGEMENT; ANTERIOR	PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Although there are numerous studies on outcomes and comparison of open and closed reduction but there is no clarity on relationship between outcomes and complications with type of surgical intervention done for Type 3 Gartland supracondylar humerus fracture. The aim of this study is to compare the outcomes and complications of closed vs open reduction in Type 3 Gartland supracondylar humerus fractures. MATERIAL AND METHODS Electronic literature searches of Embase, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library was conducted in February 2022 using the terms "supracondylar", "humerus", "fracture", "Gartland type 3" and synonymous. The data extracted included the study details, demographic data, procedure performed, final functional and cosmetic outcome according to Flynn criteria and complications of included studies. RESULTS Pooled data analysis revealed no significant difference in mean satisfactory outcome rate according to Flynn cosmetic criteria in open group (97%, 95% CI 95.5%-98.5%), as compared to closed group (97.5%, 95% CI 96.3%-98.7%), although a statistically significant difference in mean satisfactory rate according to Flynn functional criteria in open group (93.4%, 95% CI 90.8%- 96.1%) as compared to closed group (98.5%, 95% CI 97.5%-99.4%) was noted. On separate comparison of the two-arm studies, closed reduction favoured better functional outcomes (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-0.99). CONCLUSIONS Closed reduction and percutaneous fixation have better functional outcome than open reduction with K-wire fixation. But there was no significant difference in cosmetic outcomes, overall complication rate and nerve injury with either open or closed reduction. The threshold of converting a closed reduction to an open reduction in supracondylar humerus fractures of children should be high.

Materials and Methods: Out of 950 patients with calcaneal fractures and 190 patients with talar fractures treated operatively between 1984 and 2003, 11 patients (1% of calcaneal and 6% of talar fractures) were identified with combined ipsilateral talar and calcaneal fractures. Closed reduction and external fixation was performed in one patient with a crush foot injury, and ORIF in all other patients and fractures. All patients underwent clinical and radiological evaluation after a minimum followup period of one year using the AOFAS-Hindfoot Score. Results: Seven patients had central talar body and 4 patients talar neck fractures. Nine calcaneal fractures were extraarticular sustentaculum, as well as processus anterior fractures, and two were intraarticular fractures. Average followup was 6 (range, 1 to 12.5; median, 4.5) years. There were no perioperative complications related to ORIF. AOFAS-Hindfoot-Score averaged 78.6 (range, 50 to 100). The followup x-rays showed post-traumatic arthritis in the ankle joint in 3 patients and in the subtalar joint in five. AVN with peudarthorsis was present in one patient with an intraarticular calcaneal fracture. Patients with intraarticular calcaneal fractures presented with the worst functional results (AOFAS-Score, 50 and 64), none of these patients required a secondary ankle or subtalar fusion. All other patients had good and excellent functional outcome. Conclusion: Combined ipsilateral talar and calcaneal fractures are rare injuries. Extraarticular calcaneal fractures are more common in this injury pattern, while there was no preference for either talar neck or talar body fractures. Operative treatment with anatomic open reduction and internal fixation may result in favorable clinical outcome. Combined surgical approaches to the hindfoot did not result in increased morbidity.

Treatment options include implant removal, open plating, exchange nailing and external fixation. The objective of this retrospective study was to determine whether augmentation plating without nail removal is feasible for treating a humeral shaft nonunion. Materials and methods Between 2002 and 2014, 37 patients (mean age 51, range 20-84 years) with aseptic humeral shaft nonunions prior to intramedullary nailing were treated with augmentation plating. The initial fractures had been fixed with retrograde nails (10 cases) or anterograde nails (27 cases). There were 34 atrophic nonunions and 3 hypertrophic nonunions. Nonunion treatment of all patients consisted of local debridement through an anterior approach to the humerus and anterior placement of the augmentation plates. Supplemental bone grafting was performed in all atrophic nonunion cases. All patients were followed until union was radiologically confirmed. Results Union was achieved in 36 patients (97 %) after a mean of 6 months (range 3-24 months). There was one case of iatrogenic median nerve palsy that showed complete spontaneous recovery 6 weeks postoperatively. One patient sustained a peri-implant stress fracture that was treated successfully by exchanging the augmentation plate to bridge the nonunion and the fracture. No infections or wound healing complications developed. At a mean follow-up of 14 months, all patients showed free shoulder and elbow motion and no restrictions in daily or working life. Conclusions The results indicate that augmentation plating using an anterior approach is a safe and reliable option for humeral shaft nonunions after failed nailing, and the treatment has no substantial complications. Because the healing rates are similar to the standard technique of nail removal and fixation by compression or locking plates, we consider this technique to be an alternative choice for treatment.

Intraperitoneal adhesions between meshes and viscera are one of the most threatening complications, often implying reoperation or side effects such as chronic pain and bowel perforation. Despite recent advances in the optimization of mesh porous structure, incorporation of anti-adherent coatings or new approaches in the mesh fixation systems, clinicians and manufacturers are still pursuing an optimal material to improve the clinical outcomes at a cost-effective ratio. Here, bacterial nanocellulose (BNC), a bio-based polymer, is evaluated as a soft tissue reinforcement material regarding mechanical properties and in vivo anti-adhesive performance. A double-layer BNC laminate proved sufficient to meet the standards of mechanical resistance for abdominal hernia reinforcement meshes. BNC-polypropylene (BNC-PP) composites incorporating a commercial mesh have also been prepared. The in vivo study of implanted BNC patches in a rabbit model demonstrated excellent anti-adherent characteristics of this natural nanofibrous polymer 21-days after implantation and the animals were asymptomatic after the surgery. BNC emerges as a novel and versatile hernioplasty biomaterial with outstanding mechanical and anti-adherent characteristics.

Despite this, to what extent various cerclage configurations influences the fixation strength, remains undocumented. We tested the hypothesis that the stability of subtrochanteric fractures with a posteromedial wedge treated with long cephalomedullary nail varies with cerclage configuration. Methods: 40 composite femurs with a subtrochanteric osteotomy including a posteromedial-wedge were locked by cephalomedullary nailing (T2 recon, Stryker) and divided into 4 groups. In Group-A no cerclage was applied. The Group-B received a lateral tension-band (cerclage cable with crimp, Depuy-Synthes). Without any fixation, the wedge-component was removed in these groups. The Group-C was fixed with a cerclage encircling the wedge-component, while in the Group-D a novel figure-of-8 cerclage stabilised the wedge-component. Each femur was tested quasi-static in a material-testing-machine for stiffness calculation, first horizontally to simulate seated-position and then vertically to simulate standing-position. Finally, cyclic testing was performed in the upright-posture to measure deformation over time. Findings: In Group-D the mean stiffness in the sitting-position was 6.4, 5.8 and 3.1 times higher than the Groups-A, B and C, respectively, and correspondingly 2.0, 2.1 and 1.7 times higher in the standing-position (p < 0.05). Over time, Group-D demonstrated less mean deformation than tension-band (p = 0.05), while the deformation was not significantly different from the other groups. Interpretation: Additional use of cerclage enhances the stability of intramedullary nailed subtrochanteric fractures, and use of the figure-of-8 cerclage configuration, compressing the entire posteromedial-buttress, is the superior technique.

Nevertheless, complications connected with their use have been described in the literature, including the following: third-body generation, failure and consequent migration, fraying, allergies, and injury to the surgical team. The development of new materials offers alternatives to traditional metallic cables. This study compares the outcomes between two groups of patients affected by periprosthetic hip fractures, treated with titanium cables or with ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPe) iso-elastic cables. Our retrospective study aims to compare the clinical and radiological outcomes of titanium cables and UHMWPe iso-elastic cables, isolated or associated with dedicated plates, for the surgical treatment of periprosthetic fractures with stable implants. Two groups of 30 (group A-metallic cables) and 24 (group B-UHMWPe iso-elastic cables) patients have been surgically treated in our institution for hip periprosthetic fractures, between September 2017 and June 2020. The mean age of the patients was 81 years in group A and 80 years in group B. In our study, we included fractures classified as B1 or C, according to the Vancouver postoperative fractures classification; the patients were evaluated retrospectively at 1 year postoperatively, regarding the following: surgery time, blood loss, partial weight-bearing time, radiographical healing time, Harris hip score, and postoperative complications. Comparable outcomes were observed in patients from both groups. Group A showed a higher complication rate compared to group B, at 1 year postoperatively. Non-metallic nylon fiber and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPe) cerclage cables could represent a reliable fixation device, ensuring comparable healing and complication rates with traditional titanium cerclage cables.

Material/Methods: Between June 2013 and December 2015, 60 patients were treated with PKP or BCA+SSF. All patients were followed up for 12-36 months. We retrospectively reviewed outcomes, including Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), visual analogue scale (VAS), and kyphotic Cobb angle. Results: VAS, ODI, and Cobb angle, measured postoperatively and at the final follow-up, were lower than those measured preoperatively in both groups (P<0.05). VAS, ODI, and Cobb angle measured postoperatively demonstrated no significant differences when compared with those measured at the final follow-up in the PKP group (P>0.05). In the BCA+SSF group, VAS and ODI at the final follow-up were lower than those measured postoperatively (P<0.05), but no significant difference was found in the Cobb angle (P>0.05). The PKP group had better VAS and ODI than the BCA+SSF group, postoperatively (P<0.05). No significant difference was found in VAS and ODI at the final follow-up (P>0.05) or the Cobb angle measured postoperatively and at the final follow-up (P>0.05) between the 2 groups. Operative time, blood loss, and hospital stay in the PKP group were lower than those in the BCA+SSF group (P<0.05). No significant difference was found in complications (P>0.05). Conclusions: PKP patients had better early clinical outcomes, shorter operation times and hospital admission times, and decreased blood loss, but had similar complications, radiographic results, and long-term clinical outcomes compared with BCA+SSF patients.

Investigating the use of coupling agents to improve the interfacial properties between a resorbable phosphate glass and polylactic acid matrix	JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Phosphate glass; polylactic acid; coupling agent; surface analysis; interfacial shear strength	PULL-OUT TEST; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; COMPOSITE-MATERIALS; INTERNAL-FIXATION; BONE-FRACTURES; FABRICATION; FIBERS; POLYPROPYLENE; IMPLANT; REPAIR	Eight different chemicals were investigated as potential candidate coupling agents for phosphate glass fibre reinforced polylactic acid composites. Evidence of reaction of the coupling agents with phosphate glass and their effect on surface wettability and glass degradation were studied along with their principle role of improving the interface between glass reinforcement and polymer matrix. It was found that, with an optimal amount of coupling agent on the surface of the glass/polymer, interfacial shear strength improved by a factor of 5. Evidence of covalent bonding between agent and glass was found for three of the coupling agents investigated, namely: 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane; etidronic acid and hexamethylene diisocyanate. These three coupling agents also improved the interfacial shear strength and increased the hydrophobicity of the glass surface. It is expected that this would provide an improvement in the macroscopic properties of full-scale composites fabricated from the same materials which may also help to retain these properties for the desired length of time by retarding the breakdown of the fibre/matrix interface within these composites.

J	Agrawal, A; Kiyawat, V				Agrawal, Anuj; Kiyawat, Vivek			Complex AO type C3 distal femur fractures: Results after fixation with a lateral locked plate using modified swashbuckler approach	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Distal femur fracture; complex distal femur fractures; intraarticular distal femur fractures; swashbuckler approach	OPERATIVE TREATMENT; INTERNAL-FIXATION; SOCIETY; SYSTEM	Background: Complex AO type C3 fractures of the distal femur are challenging injuries, fraught with complications such as malunion and stiffness. We prospectively evaluated a consecutive series of patients with complex AO type C3 distal femur fractures to determine the clinicoradiological outcome after fixation with a single locked plate using modified swashbuckler approach. Materials and Methods: 12 patients with C3 type distal femur fractures treated with a lateral locked plate, using a modified swashbuckler approach, were included in the study. The extraarticular component was managed either by compression plating or bridge plating (transarticular approach and retrograde plate osteosynthesis) depending on the fracture pattern. Primary bone grafting was not done in any case. The clinical outcome at 1 year was determined using the Knee Society Score (KSS). The presence of any secondary osteoarthritis in the knee joint was noted at final followup. Results: All fractures united at a mean of 14.3 +/- 4.7 weeks (range 6-26 weeks). There were no significant complications such as nonunion, deep infection, and implant failure. One of the patients underwent secondary bone grafting at 3 months. The mean range of motion of the knee was 120 degrees +/- 14.8 degrees (range 105 degrees-150 degrees). Seven patients had excellent, three patients had good and two patients had a fair outcome according to the KSS at 1 year. At a mean followup of 17.6 months, three patients showed radiological evidence of secondary osteoarthritis of the knee joint. However, only one of these patients was symptomatic. Conclusion: The results of complex C3 type distal femur fractures, fixed with a single lateral locked plate using a modified swashbuckler approach, are encouraging, with a majority of patients achieving good to excellent outcome at 1 year.

Material and methods We retrospectively analyzed 21 cases of unstable pelvic fractures with concomitant acetabular fractures treated between January 2013 and December 2014. All 21 patients (18 males, 3 females), aged 43.5-55 years (range: 21-55 years), underwent surgery within four to 15 days (average = 6.5 days) after injury. We evaluated the pre-operative diagnoses, surgical approaches, types of fixation used, and prognoses. Results All 21 patients were followed-up for six to 18 months. The quality of post-operative pelvic fracture reduction (determined using the Matta scoring criteria) was excellent in five cases, good in 12, and fair in four. The clinical outcomes at the final follow-up (scored using the Majeed criteria) were excellent in ten cases, good in eight, and fair in three. The quality of post-operative acetabular fracture reduction (determined using the Matta scoring criteria) was excellent in five cases, good in 11, and poor in five. Hip joint function was evaluated at the final follow-up (using the D'Aubigne scoring system) and was excellent in eight cases, good in nine, and fair in four. The healing time was 12-18 weeks for pelvic fractures and 1222 weeks for acetabular fractures. Post-operative wound infections in two patients were controlled after second operations featuring debridement and irrigation. We found no instance of heterotopic ossification, ischemic necrosis of the femoral head, or iatrogenic vascular or nerve injury. Conclusions Good therapeutic outcomes in patients with unstable pelvic fractures and concomitant acetabular fractures can be achieved via accurate diagnosis, careful pre-operative planning, a well-performed operation, effective reduction and surgical fixation, and appropriate exercise to allow functional rehabilitation.

Six weeks after implantation, the HA/PDLLA was covered with bone and contacted the bone directly. The amount of newly formed bone in the pores was similar in both materials during the examined period. The newly formed bone in the HA/PDLLA tended to increase over 26 weeks, but that in the HA did not show a significant increase after 12 weeks. By 26 weeks, remodeling of the newly formed bone in the pores was seen and bone marrow tissue was found in the pores of the HA/PDLLA. The porous HA/PDLLA was resorbed much faster than the porous HA. Porous HA/PDLLA was resorbed continuously through bone formation and remodeling. Conversely, porous HA was scarcely resorbed throughout the period. HA/PDLLA is thought to be degraded almost completely after about I year, and in this study, porous HA/PDLLA showed excellent osteoconductivity and faster resorption than HA. Therefore, HA/PDLLA might be a desirable material for bone substitutes. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Herein, a degradable polymer poly(lactic acid) (PLA) was combined with novel hybrid nanopowder of carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-calcium phosphate (CP) for this application. In particular, CNTs-CP hybrid nano-powders (0.1 and 0.25% CNTs) were prepared from the solution of ionically modified CNTs (mCNTs), which was specifically synthesized to be well-dispersed and thus to effectively adsorb onto the CP nanoparticles. The mCNTs-CP hybrid nanopowders were then mixed with PLA (up to 50%) to produce mCNTs-CP-PLA nanocomposites. The mechanical tensile strength of the nanocomposites was significantly improved by the addition of mCNTs-CP hybrid nanopowders. Moreover, nanocomposites containing low concentration of mCNTs (0.1%) showed significantly stimulated biological responses including cell proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation in terms of gene and protein expressions. Based on this study, the addition of novel mCNT-CP hybrid nanopowders to PLA biopolymer may be considered a new material choice for developing hard tissue implants. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Treatment of acetabular fractures in older patients-introduction of a new implant for primary total hip arthroplasty	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Acetabular fracture; Total hip arthroplasty	MODIFIED STOPPA APPROACH; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; PARARECTUS APPROACH; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; OPEN REDUCTION; FIXATION; ANTERIOR; 2-INCISION; MANAGEMENT	Background Fractures of the acetabulum in younger patients are commonly treated by open reduction and internal fixation. For elderly patients, stable primary total hip arthroplasty with the advantage of immediate postoperative mobilization might be the adequate treatment. For this purpose, a sufficiently stable fixation of the acetabular component is required. Materials and Methods Between August 2009 and 2014, 30 cases were reported in which all patients underwent total hip arthroplasty additionally to a customized implant designed as an antiprotrusion cage. Inclusion criteria were an acetabular fracture with or without a previous hemiarthroplasty, age above 65 years, and pre-injury mobility dependent on a walking frame at the most. The median age was 79.9 years (65-92), and of 30 fractures, 25 were primary acetabular fractures (83%), four periprosthetic acetabular fractures (14%), and one non-union after a failed ORIF (3%). Results The average time from injury to surgery was 9.4 days (3-23) and 295 days for the non-union case. Mean time of surgery was 154.4 min (range 100 to 303). In 21 cases (70%), mobilization with full weight bearing was possible within the first 10 days. Six patients died before the follow-up examination 3 and 6 months after surgery, while 24 patients underwent radiologic examination showing consolidated fractures in bi-plane radiographs. In 9 patients, additional CT scan was performed which confirmed the radiographical results. 13 had regained their preinjury level of mobility including the non-union case. Only one patient did not regain independent mobility. Four complications were recognized with necessary surgical revision (one prosthetic head dislocation, one pelvic cement leakage, one femoral shaft fracture, and one infected hematoma). Conclusion The presented cage provides the possibility of early mobilization with full weight bearing which represents a valuable addition to the treatment spectrum in this challenging patient group.

J	Özkal, FM; Cakir, F; Sensoz, E				Ozkal, Fatih Mehmet; Cakir, Ferit; Sensoz, Ersin			Schematization of Cannulated Screw Fixations in Femoral Neck Fractures Using Genetic Algorithm and Finite Element Method	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Femoral neck fractures; Internal fixation implants; Screw configuration; Optimum design; Genetic algorithm; Finite element method	TOTAL HIP IMPLANT; FEMUR FRACTURES; PROXIMAL FEMUR; LUMBAR SPINE; OPTIMIZATION; BIOMECHANICS; PLATE; PREDICTION; STABILITY; PROVIDES	Purpose Femoral neck fracture (FNF) is one of the most observed orthopedic injuries in elderly patients with accompanying osteoporosis, while treatment process could be highly troublesome in young patients. Therefore, it is necessary to apply a strong fixation to the FNFs. This study aims to suggest an approach for the optimum screw design for FNFs using genetic algorithm (GA) and finite element method (FEM) in a seriously shorter time, considering that a very large number for the design of the implants comes forward that would take a lifetime to solve individually. Methods In biomechanical studies conducted under laboratory conditions and focusing on stabilization, limited number of combinations have been tested with limited materials by now. However, ideal position, size and number of the screws are still subject of discussion. Unlike previous biomechanical studies; the present study addresses three types of CSFs (binary screw, triple screw and quadruple screw), while aiming to determine the optimum position, size and number of the screws using a design approach based on GA and FEM. Results This study emphasizes that screw configuration plays an important role on the treatment process of the femur. As a result of all evaluations and analyses, the most effective designs have been achieved for binary, triple and quadruple screw patterns. Conclusion In this study, all of the possible combinations and screw sizes have been evaluated to determine the optimum conditions for fracture stability.

However, periosteal stripping, haematoma evacuation may result in delayed union, nonunion and infection. Refracture after plate removal is another concern. To overcome these problems intramedullary nails (IM) with different designs have been used with various outcomes. However previous IM nails have some shortcomings such is rotational instability and interlocking difficulties. We evaluated the results of newly designed IM nail in the treatment of diaphyseal forearm fractures in adults. Materials and Methods: 32 patients who had been treated with the interlocking IM nail for forearm fractures between 2011 and 2014 were included in this study. There were 23 males and 9 females with mean age of 36 years (range 18-68 years). 22 patients (68.8%) had both bone fractures. Nine patients (28.1%) had open fractures. The remaining ten patients (31.2%) had radius or ulna fractures. Grace and Eversmann rating system was used to assess functional evaluation. Patient reported outcomes were assessed using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire scores. Results: Union was achieved in all patients. The mean followup was 17 months (range 13 - 28 months). According to the Grace-Eversmann criteria, 27 patients (87.5%) had excellent or good results. The mean DASH score was 14 (range 5-36). Overall complication rate was 12.5%. Superficial infection was encountered in two patients. One patient had delayed union, however fracture healed without any additional surgical procedure. One patient who had open grade 3A, comminuted proximal third radius fracture developed radioulnar synostosis. Conclusions: The new design IM interlocking forearm nail provides satisfactory functional and radiological outcomes in the treatment of adult diaphyseal forearm fractures.

J	Yadav, V; Sharma, P; Gohiya, A				Yadav, Vishal; Sharma, Pulak; Gohiya, Ashish			Functional outcome of intraarticular distal humerus fracture fixation using triceps-sparing paratricipital approach	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Distal humerus; orthogonal plate; paratricipital surgical approach	OLECRANON OSTEOTOMY; INTERCONDYLAR FRACTURES; POSTERIOR APPROACH; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; ELBOW; MOTION; EXPERIENCE; EXPOSURE; ADULTS	Background: Displaced intraarticular distal humerus fracture has been conventionally treated operatively with various triceps disrupting approaches. These approaches are associated with several complications, such as triceps weakness, nonunion or delayed union of osteotomy, implant prominence, and delayed mobilization of the elbow. We present the functional outcome of intraarticular distal humerus fracture fixation using a triceps-sparing paratricipital approach which allows early elbow mobilization and preserving triceps strength. Materials and Methods: Twenty five patients with intraarticular distal humerus fracture were operated using triceps-sparing paratricipital approach with orthogonal plate construct. There were 16 male and 9 female patients and average age was 42.16 years (range 2365 years). The mechanism of injury was fall from height (n = 8), road traffic accident (n = 13) and ground level fall (n = 4). Clinical, radiological, and functional assessment with Mayo Elbow Performance Index (MEPI) were obtained at follow up period. Results: All fractures united primarily. At the mean follow up of 13.58 months (range 6-22 months), mean elbow flexion was 121.08 degrees (range 94 degrees-142 degrees) and mean motion arc was 114.92 degrees(range 65 degrees-140 degrees). The mean MEPI score was 94.40 points (range 70-100) with 17 excellent, five good, and three fair results. The mean flexion deformity or extension loss was 6.16 degrees (range 5 degrees-15 degrees). Conclusion: Open reduction and internal fixation of intraarticular distal humerus fractures with triceps-sparing paratricipital approach provide adequate exposure with no adverse effect on triceps muscle strength and allows early initiation of elbow motion. We analyzed, age and injury to surgical interval with relation to functional range of elbow using Z-test which is insignificant.

The purpose of this cadaveric study was to investigate the biomechanical stability of this device in relation to two common positions (center-center and inferior-center) of the helical blade in the femoral head in unstable trochanteric fractures. Materials and Methods: Eight pairs of human cadaveric femurs were used; in one group [center-center (C-C) group], the helical blade of PFNA was fixed randomly in central position both in anteroposterior and lateral view, whereas in the other group it was fixed in inferior one-third position in anteroposterior and in central position in lateral view [inferior-center (I-C) group]. Unstable intertrochanteric fracture was created and each specimen was loaded cyclically till load to failure Results: Angular and rotational displacements were significantly higher within the C-C group compared to the I-C group in both unloaded and loaded condition. Loading to failure was higher in the I-C group compared to the C-C group. No statistical significance was found for this parameter. Correlations between tip apex distance, cyclic loading which lead to femoral head displacement, and ultimate load to failure showed a significant positive relationship. Conclusion: The I-C group was superior to the C-C group and provided better biomechanical stability for angular and rotational displacement. This study would be a stimulus for further experimental studies with larger number specimens and complex loading protocols at multicentres.

A NEW MINI-INVASIVE TECHNIQUE IN TREATING PEDIATRIC DIAPHYSEAL FOREARM FRACTURES BY BIOABSORBABLE ELASTIC STABLE INTRAMEDULLARY NAILING: A PRELIMINARY TECHNICAL REPORT	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article						Children and adolescents; pediatric; radius and ulna; forearm injuries; fracture fixation; intramedullary nailing; bioabsorbable implants; orthopedic surgical procedures	INTERNAL-FIXATION; CHILDREN; COMPLICATIONS; SURGERY; PATTERN	Background and Aim: Operative treatment is often indicated in unstable pediatric diaphyseal forearm fractures. Recently minimally invasive reduction and elastic stable intramedullary nailing have been of increasing interest, instead of open reduction and internal fixation with plates. There are several disadvantages of metallic intramedullary implants, such as soft-tissue irritation and a risk of disturbing later imaging. Thus, they are generally removed in later operations. We aimed to develop a new technique to stabilize pediatric forearm fractures by the bioabsorbable intramedullary nailing. Material and Methods: We developed a new, two-stage mini-invasive surgical technique to stabilize the unstable diaphyseal fractures in children. The procedure is bioabsorbable elastic stable intramedullary nailing. Ultra-high-strength bioabsorbable intramedullary nails of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) were manufactured for our purpose. The material has been widely proven to be biocompatible and stable enough for fracture treatment as screws and pins. We have used the new technique in the unstable both-bone diaphyseal forearm fractures in children between the ages of 5 and 15 years. We report the technique and our clinical experience in the series of those three cases that have been followed up for at least 12 months. The present series has been randomized for the procedure instead for titanium elastic stable intramedullary nailing, and the series represents a part of ongoing randomized trial. Results: The reported cases operated by the new technique referred good union in the fractured bones and acceptable alignment in the follow-up. Removal of the implants was not required. No troubles with the procedure or implant per se were noticed, indicating good feasibility. One high-energy refracture occurred half year after the primary trauma. Traditional titanium implants were used to control the refracture. Conclusions: We report our preliminary experience of a new surgical mini-invasive procedure to stabilize the unstable pediatric forearm shaft fractures by bioabsorbable elastic stable intramedullary nailing. Our clinical experience suggests that the procedure combined with long-arm casting is feasible in treating the pediatric forearm fractures. The technique may bring benefits to handling these challenging fractures. The disadvantages of metallic implants may be avoided. In addition, removal of the implant will not be required. There was one refracture in the series, but it was due to new high-energy trauma. According to our understanding, it was not related to the type of former osteosynthesis. However, ignoring the good preliminary experience, still we do not have results of the superiority of the procedure over traditional elastic stable intramedullary nailing. Our ongoing randomized multicenter study is aimed to determine its long-term outcome against the present golden standard. Nevertheless, due to encouraging preliminary results, we see it necessary to report the technique.

Atypical femoral fractures related to bisphosphonate treatment	BONE & JOINT JOURNAL			English	Article							SUPPRESSED BONE TURNOVER; LONG-TERM TREATMENT; MICRODAMAGE ACCUMULATION; STRESS-FRACTURES; FEMUR FRACTURES; BIOMECHANICAL PROPERTIES; INSUFFICIENCY FRACTURES; STRONTIUM RANELATE; SHAFT FRACTURES; SUBTROCHANTERIC FRACTURE	Aims Treatment guidelines for atypical femoral fractures associated with bisphosphonates have not been established. We conducted a systematic review of the treatment of atypical femoral fractures first, to evaluate the outcomes of surgical fixation of complete atypical fractures and secondly, to assess whether prophylactic surgery is necessary for incomplete atypical fractures. Materials and Methods Case reports and series were identified from the PubMed database and were included if they described the treatment of atypical femoral fractures. In total, 77 publications met our inclusion criteria and 733 patients with 834 atypical complete or incomplete femoral fractures were identified. Results For complete fractures, internal fixation was predominantly achieved by intramedullary nailing. The mean time to healing post-operatively was 7.3 months (2 to 31). Revision surgery for nonunion or implant failure was needed in 77 fractures (12.6%). A greater percentage of fractures treated with plate fixation (31.3%) required revision surgery than those treated with intramedullary nailing (12.9%) (p < 0.01). Non-operative treatment of incomplete fractures failed and surgery was eventually needed in nearly half of the patients (47%), whereas prophylactic surgery was successful and achieved a 97% rate of healing. Conclusion Intramedullary nailing is the first-line treatment for a complete fracture, although the risk of delayed healing and revision surgery seems to be higher than with a typical femoral fracture. Non-operative treatment does not appear to be a reliable way of treating an incomplete fracture: prophylactic intramedullary nailing should be considered if the patient is in intractable pain. Radiographs of the opposite side should be obtained routinely looking for an asymptomatic fracture. Bisphosphonates must be discontinued but ongoing metabolic management in the form of calcium and/or vitamin D supplements is advisable. Teriparatide therapy can be considered as an alternative treatment.	[Koh, A.; Guerado, E.; Giannoudis, P.

Comparison of Initial Compression of the Medial, Lateral, and Posterior Screws in an Ankle Fusion Construct	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Ankle Fusion; Internal Fixation; Arthrodesis; Contact Area; Pressure	TIBIOTALOCALCANEAL ARTHRODESIS; INTRAMEDULLARY FIXATION; PLATE	Background: One of the requirements for successful ankle arthrodesis is adequate compression by the fixation across the fusion surfaces. A common screw construct for ankle fusion is three crossed screws from proximal-to-distal. Because the screws are inserted nearly orthogonal to each other, it is possible minimal additional compression is obtainable once the first screw is inserted. The aim of this study was to determine which of the three screws gave the greatest initial compression and theoretically should be inserted first. Materials and Methods: Seventeen cadaver limbs were dissected to expose the anterior and posterior aspects of the tibiotalar joint. Three Fuji film templates were created for each ankle joint with a hole to accommodate a 7.0-mm cannulated screw. Each film was tested with a single medial, lateral, or posterior screw. The Fuji films were then analyzed for contact area, percent contact area, and pressure. Results: There was no difference in the total contact area, percent contact area, or pressure generated between the three screws. The mean contact area for all screws was 11% of the joint surface. All three screws had greater contact area and percent contact area over the anterior half of the ankle joint. Conclusion: The medial, lateral, and posterior screws were equivalent with respect to contact area, percent contact area, and pressure generated across the tibiotalar joint. All three screws had greater contact area over the anterior half of the joint. Only 11% of the tibiotalar joint surface came in contact following the insertion of a single partially threaded screw. Clinical Relevance: In a neutrally aligned ankle arthrodesis the order of screw insertion does not affect the amount of compression ultimately achieved at the fusion site.

However, foreign-body reactions remain a major concern and evidence of complete resorption is lacking. This study compared the physico-chemical properties, histological response and radiographs of four copolymeric biodegradable osteosynthesis systems in a goat model with 48-months follow-up. The systems were implanted subperiosteally in both tibia and radius of 12 Dutch White goats. The BioSorb FX [poly(70LLA-co-30DLLA)], Inion CPS [poly([70-78.5] LLA-co-[16-24]DLLA-co-4TMC)], SonicWeld Rx [poly(DLLA)], LactoSorb [poly(82LLA-co-18GA)] systems and a negative control were randomly implanted in each extremity. Samples were assessed at 6-, 12-, 18-, 24-, 36-, and 48-month follow-up. Surface topography was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Differential scanning calorimetry and gel permeation chromatography were performed on initial and explanted samples. Histological sections were systematically assessed by two blinded researchers using (polarized) light microscopy, SEM and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. The SonicWeld Rx system was amorphous while the others were semi-crystalline. Foreign-body reactions were not observed during the complete follow-up. The SonicWeld Rx and LactoSorb systems reached bone percentages of negative controls after 18 months while the BioSorb Fx and Inion CPS systems reached these levels after 36 months. The SonicWeld Rx system showed the most predictable degradation profile. All the biodegradable systems were safe to use and well-tolerated (i.e., complete implant replacement by bone, no clinical or histological foreign body reactions, no [sterile] abscess formation, no re-interventions needed), but nanoscale residual polymeric fragments were observed at every system's assessment.

Anterolateral and Medial Locking Plate Stiffness in Distal Tibial Fracture Model	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Tibia; Pilon; Fracture; Biomechanical; Sawbones	PILON FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; STRUCTURAL-PROPERTIES; PLAFOND FRACTURES; EXTERNAL FIXATION; COMPOSITE FEMURS; OPEN REDUCTION; BONE; MANAGEMENT; PROTOCOL	Background: The purpose of this study was to compare the axial and torsional stiffness between anterolateral and medial distal tibial locking plates in a pilon fracture model. Materials and Methods: The biomechanical stiffness of anterolateral or medial plated pilon fracture models was evaluated. Six Sawbones Composite Tibiae with a simulated pilon fracture representing yarns or valgus comminution (OTA 43-A2.2) were plated with a Synthes 3.5-mm contoured LCP anterolateral or medial locking distal tibia plate. Load as a function of axial displacement and torque as a function of angular displacement were recorded. Each tibia was tested with a fracture wedge in place and removed with a medial and then anterolateral plate. Results: Loading the tibial plateau medial to the central axis, no significant difference in mean stiffness between the anterolateral and medial plates was demonstrated with the fracture wedge in place. A significant difference was demonstrated with the wedge removed. Loading the plateau posterior to the central axis, no significant difference in mean stiffness between plates was demonstrated with the wedge in place or removed. With the wedge in place, there was a significant difference in mean torsional stiffness for clockwise rotation, but not counterclock-wise rotation. With the wedge removed, no significant difference appeared in mean stiffness for clockwise and counterclock-wise rotation. Conclusion: Distal tibia extra-articular fractures stabilized with anterolateral or medial locking plate constructs demonstrated no statistically significant difference in biomechanical stiffness in compression and torsion testing. Clinical Relevance: We believe this study indicates the primary concern when treating a pilon fracture may be soft-tissue considerations. Further clinical studies are required before definitive changes can be recommended regarding piton fracture fixation.

The least noble metal in such a galvanic coupling is more likely to corrode. However, some studies have failed to show increased corrosion when titanium and stainless steel are combined. The aim of this study was to determine the fretting corrosion of the contact areas between screws and plates made of these dissimilar metals used for internal fixation of bone fractures. The plates were fixed to a bone-simulating material and subjected to tensile and compressive forces in both human serum and Hank's solution. The outcome variables included in the analyses were weight loss, and release of Ti, Cr, Ni and Mo to the different media. Results from the multiple combinations were subjected to multivariate statistics. Principal component analysis visualised our findings and allowed classification of similar samples and separation of discrepant groups of samples. We found a significant effect of the test medium, but no dramatic effect due to mixing of metals. The titanium screws and plates corroded more in serum than in saline, while the opposite was true for stainless steel. Combination of dissimilar screws and plates did not cause higher weight loss or metal release than the single-material constructions, indicating comparable clinical safety. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to simulate possible end stage reactions the PLA96 was also predegraded in vitro until approximately 50% weight loss. The local reaction of predegraded PLA (PLA96(168)) was compared to the local reaction of polyethylene (PE) and non-predegraded PLA (PLA96). For PE and PLA96 a mild local reaction was observed at all time points consisting of a minimal layer of macrophage like cells with incidentally multinucleated giant cells at the implant interface, surrounded by a mild connective tissue capsule. For PLA96 at weeks 13 and 26 some minimal alterations in terms of degradation and ingrowth of cells was noted. The in vitro incubation (90degreesC for 168 h) of PLA96(168) resulted for the thin 0.2 mm samples in complete degradation. Predegraded 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 turn PLA96(168) samples were implanted and evaluated. The 1.0 and 2.0 mm samples could be evaluated for all time points investigated. but some 0.5 mm PLA96168 samples were already completely resorbed at week 2 after implantation. In general, responses found for the predegraded PLA96(168) at weeks 2, 13 and 26 were similar with a pronounced macrophage infiltrate containing birefringent material. encapsulation of polymer fragments, and the presence of a debris area consisting Of Polymer and cellular remnants. in lymph nodes foamy macrophages with birefringent material were only observed in lymph nodes draining sites with predegraded PLA96(168). Immunohistochemistry was performed for further characterization of the cellular infiltrate. At the implant interface of the nondegrading PE and PLA96, ED1 and OX6 (MHC class 11) positive cells were identified. In the capsule macrophage Eke cells expressed all three macrophage markers ED1, ED2, and ED3. CD4 and CD8 positive cells. indicating T helper and T supressor/cytotoxic cells, respectively. could be observed in low numbers, CD4 more than CD8. Both CD4 and CD8 were occasionally observed within the degrading PLA96(168) implant. Polymorphonuclear neutrophilic granulocytes were mainly observed at 2 weeks after implantation. We showed that predegradation Could be used as a means to study late tissue reactions to polymers. Complete degradation may be studied with relatively thin implants, but this may lead to rather optimistic interpretation of resorption periods. When materials are intended to be used for screws and/or plates for bone fixation, implants of at least 1.0-2.0 mm thickness should be used as these May show a more realistic representation of the resorption characteristics of the material under investigation.

Several approaches are currently employed in the treatment of this kind of defect. Overall, the most common method involves using a quite invasive metallic support (a Burch-Schneider ring). Moreover, valid alternatives and less invasive techniques still need to be supported by novel material development. In this work, we evaluated the performance of SmartBone (R), a xenohybrid bone graft composed of a bovine bone matrix reinforced with biodegradable polymers and collagen, as an effective support in acetabular prosthesis reconstruction. Specifically, the material's mechanical properties were experimentally determined (E = similar to 1.25 GPa, E-f = similar to 0.34 GPa, and Et = similar to 0.49 GPa) and used for simulation of the hip joint system with a SmartBone (R) insert. Moreover, a comparison with a similar case treated with a Burch-Schneider ring was also conducted. It was found that it is possible to perform THA revision surgeries without the insertion of an invasive metal support and it can be nicely combined with SmartBone (R)'s osteointegration characteristics. The material can withstand the loads independently (sigma(max) = similar to 12 MPa) or be supported by a thinner titanium plate in contact with the bone in the worst cases. This way, improved bone regeneration can be achieved.

Here, we present two cases in which treatment was performed using virtual surgical planning and CAD/CAM to produce surgical guides and reconstruction plates, and evaluate their outcome from clinical and radiographical standpoints. Background: Marginal mandible resection is required to achieve healing in some cases of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ). Despite the sparsity of the literature, computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) materials may provide superior outcomes for patients with an increased risk of mandible fracture. The aim of this study was to report a digital workflow for surgical interventions to prevent mandible fracture in MRONJ patients. Methods: We present two cases in which virtual surgical planning (VSP) and CAD/CAM surgical guides and reconstruction plates were used to prevent mandible fractures in elderly MRONJ patients submitted for marginal resection. Two osteoporotic patients, aged 73 and 84 years, presented with stage 3 MRONJ of the right mandibular body with inferior alveolar nerve involvement. The unaffected bone height was 6 mm in both cases, implying a high risk of mandible fracture. After preoperative VSP, surgery was performed through a combined intraoral-transbuccal approach. CAD/CAM-customized cutting guides and reconstruction plates were used for the marginal resection of necrotic bone and internal fixation. Results: Complete healing was achieved and the patients remained asymptomatic up to 1 year post-surgery. Conclusions: VSP and CAD/CAM-customized materials facilitated the complete resection of necrotic bone and rigid fixation in MRONJ patients, allowing a simplified approach with shorter operative times, reduced morbidity, and predictable results.

Ten femoral heads from female patients with femoral neck fractures were extracted during surgery (five for the Aged group, aged 65-66 years; five for the Advanced aged group, aged 85-95 years). The femoral head was divided into three equal layers (anterior, central, and posterior) in the coronal view, and each layer was segmented into five regions (superior, central, inferior, medial, and lateral). Nanoindentation testing and atomic force microscopy imaging were used to study the mechanical properties and surface morphology of the specimens. No statistical differences in grain size were found between age groups, which suggested that the nanostructure of trabeculae in the femoral heads of postmenopausal women cannot be used to predict age-related bone loss and fracture risk. Mechanical properties in the longitudinal direction deteriorated more quickly than those in the transverse direction for the whole femoral head. Comparisons between layers showed a higher deterioration rate with aging in the anterior layer than in other layers. In different regions, mechanical properties of the medial and lateral regions deteriorated more quickly than those in the three other regions, and deterioration in the longitudinal direction was more serious than that in the transverse direction. The regional deterioration patterns and material properties with aging observed in this study contribute to an understanding of the age-related fracture mechanism and provide a basis for predicting age-related fracture risk and decreasing early fixation failure in the proximal femur.

Small-diameter nails that preserve the endosteal blood supply act as load-sharing devices after proximal and distal locking. Despite fracture healing is influenced by movements at the fracture gap, no data are available reporting on the micromovements at the fracture site if small-diameter nails were used. Methods: Using a Sawbone distal tibia fracture model, we assessed offset, elastic, plastic, permanent, and overall deformation at the fracture site for four small-diameter tibia nails (Expert, Synthes, Saluburg, Austria; Connex, ITS Spectromed, Lassnitzhohe, Austria; Versanail, DePuy, Vienna, Austria; T2, Stryker, Vienna, Austria) after mechanical testing with a servohydraulic material testing machine. Cyclic loading was performed with a sinusoidal load of 700 N (+/- 600) for 40,000 cycles representing 6 weeks of full weight bearing. Results: Offset deformation was significantly higher for the Connex nail when compared with other nails (p < 0.001). Regarding elastic deformation, no significant difference was recorded between the implants. Plastic deformation was significantly lower if the Connex nail was used (0.134 [+/- 0.053] mm; p < 0.001). Elastic deformation did not exceed 0.7 mm and plastic deformation did not exceed 0.4 mm. Regarding permanent and overall deformation, no significant difference between the implants was recorded. Conclusions: Considerable deformation at the fracture gap can be assumed even after partial weight bearing with 100 N. Despite comparable material properties, differences in axial micromotion were recorded among the nail types used in this series. The number of distal locking screws (three or four) did not substantially influence the axial movements at the fracture gap.

However, the risk of sural nerve injury and the strength of repair are still the most concerning aspects. Material and methods Twenty three patients with acute Achilles tendon rupture were reviewed in the present study. We stitch the Achilles tendon above the ruptured site using the endoscopic locking loop suture technique, and the knotless anchor suture-bridge technique can be used to make the distal fixation of threads. The function was assessed using the muscle power (MRC0-5), ATRS scores, AOFAS ankle-hindfoot scores, and VAS scores at the final follow-up. Results The mean follow-up time was 15.74 +/- 2.43 months (12-18). At the final follow-up, the average of the muscle power (MRC0-5), ATRS score, AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score, and VAS score are 4.74 +/- 0.45, 97.83 +/- 2.77, 96.52 +/- 4.87, and 0.35 +/- 0.49, respectively. Every patient returned to previous sports activity at 6 months postoperative. No wound infection and sural nerve injuries were encountered. Only one case suffers local irritation at the medial knotless anchor site. Conclusions Endoscopic "internal splinting" repair for acute Achilles tendon rupture using locking loop stitch with suture-bridge technique leads to an expedited return to activity with a low risk of complications.

Atomic-force microscopy (AFM) is widely used for characterization of these properties. However, only surface or isolated plant cells have been used for such investigations, at least as non-embedded samples. Theories that claim a restrictive role of a particular tissue in plant growth cannot be confirmed without direct measurement of the mechanical properties of internal tissue cell walls. Here we report an approach of assessing the nanomechanical properties of primary cell walls in the inner tissues of growing plant organs. The procedure does not include fixation, resin-embedding or drying of plant material. Vibratome-derived longitudinal and transverse sections of maize root were investigated by AFM in a liquid cell to track the changes of cell wall stiffness and elasticity accompanying elongation growth. Apparent Young's modulus values and stiffness of stele periclinal cell walls in the elongation zone of maize root were lower than in the meristem, i.e., cell walls became more elastic and less resistant to an applied force during their elongation. The trend was confirmed using either a sharp or spherical probe. The availability of such a method may promote our understanding of individual tissue roles in the plant growth processes.

This work shows how these mechanical loads affect lithium-ion cells. Therefore pouch and cylindrical cells are stressed with vibrational and shock profiles according to the UN 383 standard. Additionally, a vibration test is set up to reflect stress in real-world applications and is carried out for 186 days. The effects of the load profiles on the tested cells are investigated by capacity measurement, impedance spectroscopy, micro-X-ray computed tomography and post mortem analyses. The mechanical stress has no effect on the investigated pouch cells. Although all tested cylindrical cells would pass the standard tests, in certain cells stressed in a vertical position the mandrel dispatched itself and struck against internal components. This caused bruised active materials, short circuits, a damaged current collector and current interrupt device. The investigations are not directly transferrable to all pouch or cylindrical cells but show that the mechanical cell design, especially the fixation of the internal components, determines whether a cell withstands vibrations and shocks. Depending on the cell design and the loading direction, long-term vibrational loads can have additional detrimental effects on lithium-ion cells compared to standard tests. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis took into account two variants of the osteosynthesis. Variant I included the osteosynthesis in which plate was attached directly to the bone, in variant II, the plate was moved away from the bones by about 5 mm. Biomechanical characteristics of the corrective osteotomy plate-tibia was determined for implants made of Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The boundary conditions adopted for the analysis reflect phenomena occurring in a real system. Based on the results of the analysis relative displacements and reduced stresses in various components were determined as a function of the applied load within the range of F = 500-1500 N. The maximum forces, both variant I and variant II determined during analysis, ensure that the generated stress does not exceed yield strength of the material and compressive strength of the bone, and do not exceed safety movement in the fracture gap. In addition, it was found that the locking of the compressive plate to the bone has a little effect on the distribution of displacements and stresses on the plate-tibia system in the case of a simple fracture.

The modified clays were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, thermal gravimetric analysis coupled with mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared, and solid-state MAS NMR. These techniques demonstrated the effectiveness of the interlamellar grafting process. An expansion of the interlayer distance from 11.2 to 15.9-16.4 angstrom on going from the precursors to the nanohybrid materials was observed. The study of the thermal behavior of the organoclays showed the release under heating of grafted APTES fragments, typical of the decomposition products of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen bearing organic matter. The hydroxyl stretching vibration zone (3700-3600 cm-(1)) of the starting clays and of the DMSO intercalated precursors was intensively perturbed in the final materials. New bands were observed, indicating strong interactions between APTES and the kaolinite interlayer surfaces. Solid-state Si-29 CP-MAS NMR spectra of silylated kaolinite showed T-2 and T-3 signals corresponding to the linkage of APTES moieties. This was confirmed by the relative intensities of the signals in the quantitative C-13 CP-MAS NMR spectra of the nanohybrid materials. Concomitant silylation and ethoxylation of the interlayer aluminol surface were obtained to give a mixed alkoxy-organosilyl kaolinite derivative. The silylation was roughly equally distributed between bidentate and tridentate fixations, with a minor amount of monodentate material. A remarkable feature of the new materials was their response to the [Ru(CN)(6)](4-) electrochemical probe in acidic medium when the functionalized clays were coated on a platinum electrode. This is due to the protonated amine groups that act as anion exchange sites. These preliminary results open the way to further development of kaolinite-based electrochemical sensors.

Mini-invasive nail versus DHS to fix pertrochanteric fractures: A case-control study	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Trochanteric fractures; Internal fixation; Intramedullary nailing; Mini-invasive surgery; DHS	DYNAMIC HIP SCREW; PROXIMAL FEMORAL NAIL; MEDOFF SLIDING PLATE; GAMMA-NAIL; INTERTROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; INTRAMEDULLARY NAIL; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; SUBTROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; TROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; FIXATION	Background: Fixation devices to treat trochanteric fractures belong to two general categories: dynamic hip screw (DHS) type and intramedullary type implants. In spite of possible pitfalls, both are considered valid options. Comparing a sliding screw-plate system (DHS) along a mini-invasive nailing device (BCM (TM) nail) with primary insertion of the cephalic screw, sheds light on the debated management of trochanteric fractures. Hypothesis: Due to its design, the BCM (TM) nailing system allows a stable internal fixation and promotes enhanced postoperative functional recovery. Objectives: To test this hypothesis in a comparative prospective case-control study using the DHS screw-plate as a reference. Materials and methods: Two groups of 30 patients, older than 60 years old, with trochanteric fractures were included in this study. The screw-plates were placed according to the standard method. Regarding the nailing system, the cephalic screw was positioned first, then the nail was inserted through the screw via a mini-invasive approach and locked distally using a bicortical screw. Comparison between the two groups was based on (1) operative data: operating time, intra-and postoperative blood loss; (2) immediate postoperative course: complications, length of hospital stay, delay to sitting in a wheelchair; (3) the postdischarge evolution: weightbearing, readmission to hospital; (4) functional outcomes: recovery and mobility; (5) anatomical outcomes: restitution and bone healing. Results: The operating time (54 +/- 8.8 min vs 59 +/- 13.8 min) and intraoperative (1.37 +/- 0.98 vs 1.90 +/- 1.43) and at Day 3 (1.25 +/- 1.05 vs 1.82 +/- 1.5) blood loss (haemoglobin loss), were favourable to the screw-plate subgroup (p < 0.05). The delay to sitting in a wheelchair (4.76 +/- 1.53 d vs 4 +/- 1.44 d) was favourable to the nail subgroup (p < 0.05). There was a higher incidence of secondary displacements in the screw-plate subgroup (3/26 [11.5%] vs 0/25 [0%]) (p < 0.05). The screw-plate subgroup demonstrated a poorer healing rate at 3 months (88% vs 100%) (p < 0.05). Regarding functional recovery, a lesser decrease in the Parker score was observed in the nail subgroup at 3 postoperative months (2.42 +/- 2.3 vs 1.52 +/- 1.44) (p < 0.05). Conclusion: This study has shown the benefits of the BCM (TM) nail in terms of stability. But the potential advantages of this mini-invasive technique were limited by ancillary-related difficulties which need to be rectified. These preliminary results are in favour of a further development of this innovating device. Level of evidence: Level III. Case-report study. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

However, obese patients require reinforced internal fixation materials to prevent internal fixation frac-tures and hardware failure after osteotomy. Therefore, the purpose of our study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of distal tibial tuberosity high tibial osteotomy (DTT-HTO) using the new patented pi-shaped plate in obese patients with varus knee osteoarthritis. Method: Thirty-four obese patients (39 knees) with varus knee osteoarthritis who underwent DTT-HTO with the pi-shaped plate and second-look arthroscopy when implant removal occurred from September 2017 to June 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Three-dimensional surgical planning using DTT-HTO on the knees is performed. There were 9 males and 25 females, with body mass index (BMI) values ranging from 30.3 to 38.5 kg/m2 and ages ranging from 50 to 75 years old. The radiological assess-ment was performed with the femora tibial angle (FTA) and the weight-bearing line ratio (WBLR). The clinical outcomes were evaluated by the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) knee score and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). The status of the cartilage was eval-uated by the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grading system. Results: All patients were followed up for 18-30 months. The FTA significantly changed from 181.68 +/- 1.68.preoperatively to171.29 +/- 1.51.at the last follow-up (P < 0.001). The WBLR significantly in-creased from 16.85 +/- 2.20 to 55.41 +/- 2.46% from before surgery to the last follow-up after surgery (P < 0.001). The HSS score significantly improved from 56.65 +/- 5.27 preoperatively to 68.79 +/- 2.61, 77.82 +/- 2.15, and 86.12 +/- 2.78 at the 6-month, 12-month, and last follow-up after surgery (P < 0.001). The WOMAC score significantly decreased from 105.47 +/- 3.89 preoperatively to 80.50 +/- 4.20, 71.44 +/- 4.65, and 52.44 +/- 3.14 at the 6-month, 12-month, and last follow-up after surgery (P < 0.001). During implant re-moval, no internal fixation fractures occurred in any patient. The articular cartilage grade in the me-dial compartment of the knee were significantly higher in the second arthroscopy than in the first arthroscopy, according to the ICRS grading system (P < 0.001). The articular cartilage grade in the lateral compartment of the knee showed no statistical differences from the first-to the second-look arthroscopy (P > 0.05). Conclusion: There are no correlation between BMI and postoperative outcomes. DTT-HTO shows yield excellent clinical results in obese patients with varus knee osteoarthritis. It can be recommended to be used for the heavy patients. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

This retrospective analysis was performed to evaluate the radiological outcome of proximal humerus fractures treated with angular stable plates and additional screw-tip cement augmentation in patients over the age of 60. Materials and methods A retrospective single centre analysis was conducted from June 2013 to December 2016. The minimum follow-up time was set to 6 months after surgery. Anatomical reduction and fixation were evaluated in respect to reattached tuberosities to the head fragment and the adequate restoration of the calcar area not showing any valgus or varus malalignment. Complete fracture healing was determined 3 months after surgery. Any failures such as secondary displacement, primary screw perforation, intraarticular cement leakage and avascular necrosis of the humeral head with concomitant screw cut-out were assessed. Results In total, 24 patients (21 females; 3 males) at a median age of 77.5 (62-96) years were included. Five 2-part, twelve 3-part and seven 4-part fractures were detected. The measured median BMD value of 23 patients was 78.4 mg/cm(3)(38.8-136.9 mg/cm(3)). Anatomical reduction was achieved in 50% of the patients. In most cases, theAlevel screws and theB1 screw were augmented with bone cement by a median of 7 (5-9) head screws used. Postoperative varus displacement was not detected in any of the patients. One patient (4.2%) sustained an early secondary displacement. Intraarticular cement leakage was detected in 3 patients (2 head-split fractures). Avascular necrosis of the humeral head was observed in 4 patients (16.7%). Revision surgery was necessary in four cases, using hemiarthroplasty twice and reverse shoulder arthroplasty the other two times. Conclusion Screw-tip augmentation in angular stable plating for proximal humerus fracture treatment showed a low secondary displacement rate of 4.2% in patients suffering from poor bone quality. Nevertheless, the occurrence of avascular necrosis of the humeral head with mainly severe fracture patterns observed in this study was higher compared to previously reported results in the literature. Cement augmentation in head-split fractures is not recommended, considering the high risk of an intraarticular cement leakage.

Radiographic, histologic, and chemical evaluation of bioresorbable 70/30 poly-L-lactide-CO-D, L-lactide interbody fusion cages in a goat model	SPINE			English	Article						lumbar spine; interbody fusion; bioresorbable cages; goat; animal model; poly-L-lactide-CO-D-L-lactide	CERVICAL-SPINE FUSION; IN-VITRO DEGRADATION; POLY(L-LACTIC ACID); BIODEGRADABLE POLYMERS; TITANIUM CAGES; FOLLOW-UP; BONE; IMPLANTS; SURGERY; STIFFNESS	Study Design. A study of lumbar interbody fusion using polylactic acid-based bioresorbable fusion cages in a goat model. Objective. To evaluate the effect of polylactic acid polymer composition, and internal stabilization on the rate and quality of interbody fusion. Summary of Background Data. A spinal cage should provide an appropriate biomechanical environment to facilitate interbody fusion. Previous studies have shown that bioresorbable polylactic acid-based cages can provide adequate stability for spinal fusion. However, at present and to our knowledge, the best bioresorbable materials, optimal cage stiffness, and desired period over which the cage should biodegrade are unknown. Methods. Interbody fusions were performed at L3-L4 level in 35 skeletally mature Dutch milk goats. Titanium and poly-L-lactide-CO-D,L-lactide (PLDLLA) cages were implanted at random as stand-alone cages. In addition, PLDLLA cages were implanted with anterior fixation. The goats were euthanized at 3, 6, or 12 months. Radiographic, magnetic resonance imaging, histologic, and histomorphometric analyses were performed on retrieved segments. Chemical analysis was used to assess degradation of the retrieved PLDLLA cages. Beforehand, chemical and mechanical degradation of the PLDLLA cages were assessed in vitro. Results. At 3 months, bone graft was almost completely remodeled. Endochondral bone formation was observed in all specimens. At 6 months, 50% of the PLDLLA stand-alone cages and 83% of the PLDLLA anterior fixation cages were fused. At 12 months, 38% of the PLDLLA stand-alone and 83% of the titanium cages realized fusion. A very mild and dispersed foreign body reaction was seen in all PLDLLA specimens. E-beam sterilized PLDLLA cages degraded more rapidly in vivo as compared to both, PLDLLA cages in vitro, and ethylene oxide sterilized poly-L-lactic acid cages in vivo. Conclusions. Within the 3-6-month period, PLDLLA stand-alone cages provided insufficient mechanical stability, which manifested as cracking and deformation of the cages and lower fusion rates. This result implies that within this time, additional stabilization is required; supplemental internal fixation proved sufficient to obtain successful fusion. In all cases, only a mild host response was seen, indicating good biocompatibility.

MethodsFourteen patients who had undergone definitive treatment at an academic Level 1 trauma center from May 2007 to December 2013 for distal femur nonunion were identified from a fracture database. Thirteen of them were female; the average age was 65 years (range, 50-84 years). Ten patients had sustained their injuries in falls at ground level, and four in motor vehicle accidents. Twelve patients were obese (body mass index 30), 10 had diabetes, none were current smokers, and one had an open fracture classified as type IIIa according to the Gustilo-Anderson classification system for open fractures. The fractures were classified according to the AO classification system for distal femur fractures; there were three type 33-A1, six 33-A2, two 33-A3 and three 33-C3 fractures. Methods of definitive treatment involved open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) revision, medial plating, bone grafting and the use of other biologic materials. ResultsEight of the 14 patients (57%) achieved union during follow-up. Definitive treatment for nonunion involved ORIF revision in 11 cases. Three patients who did not undergo ORIF revision were treated with iliac crest stem cell autografts, bone graft substitutes or recombinant human-bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rh-BMP-2). Other treatments included rh-BMP-2 (12 cases), iliac crest bone autograft (five), iliac crest stem cell autograft (two), crushed cancellous bone allograft (three), CaSO (4) and tricalcium phosphate bone graft substitute (two) and demineralized bone matrix (one). The average time from definitive treatment to union was 19 weeks (range, 12-51 weeks). Two of the 11 cases who underwent ORIF revision had medial plates added to improve biomechanical stability and prevent varus collapse. This was also performed in one patient with a grade III open type 33-C3 fracture and one with a closed 33-A2 fracture. Five study patients had comminuted fractures. Two had type 33-A3 and three type 33-C3 fractures. Both patients with 33-A3 fractures and 2 two with 33-C3 fractures had persistent nonunion at the end of follow-up. ConclusionsDefinitive treatment of distal femur nonunion after initial treatment with a locking plate had a low rate of success in this study, suggesting that this procedure is ineffective as a definitive treatment for distal femur nonunion.

In this study, long-term tissue response to bioabsorbable fracture fixation screws made of poly-L-lactide and to similar metallic screws in cancellous bone was examined and compared with intact bone. The postoperative evaluation of the rabbit femora was performed by using plain radiography, microradiography, histology, histomorphometry, and oxytetracycline labeling studies. The follow-up times were 36 and 51 months in groups of 15 and 14 rabbits, respectively. A walling-off response by formation of trabecular bone which outlined the screw profile was observed in the PLLA and metallic groups both. Connective tissue between this bone front and the implant was seen only in the PLLA group. There was no difference in the thickness of the layer between the two follow-up groups. Between the surgically handled femora and the intact control bone, there was no statistically significant difference in the amount of trabecular bone. The osteoid formation activity in the tissue-implant interface showed no differences between the groups. However, active osteoblasts were visible only in the PLLA group. The amount of birefringent PLLA material diminished between the 36-month and the 51-month follow-up groups. Within the follow-up times of this study, both the PLLA screws and the metallic screws were rather inert. Also, long-term walling-off was a typical response to both PLLA and metallic screws in cancellous bone. PLLA screws did not evoke any osteostimulatory reaction over the long-term follow-up. The findings clearly demonstrated that the overall degradation process of PLLA was very slow and accompanied by fibrous tissue formation. Macrophage activity seemed to be related to the slow degradation process of PLLA and might be associated with the formation of connective tissue replacing the original implant. The results of this study showed no significant differences between the bioabsorbable PLLA screws and the metallic screws in biocompatibility, and no signs of inflammatory foreign-body reactions occurred during the follow-up.

However, regardless of a transoral or a posterior approach, the reduction is still not satisfactory. PURPOSE: The article describes and evaluates a new technique for treating unstable atlas fractures by using a monoaxial screw-rod system. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective study. PATIENT SAMPLE: The sample includes adult patients with unstable C1 fractures treated with a posterior monoaxial screw-rod system. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures included a visual analog pain scale, radiographic reduction (lateral mass displacement [LMD]), maintenance of reduction, C1-C2 instability (anterior atlantodens interval), and complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From August 2013 to May 2016, nine consecutive patients with unstable atlas fractures were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were treated with posterior ORIF by using a monoaxial screw-rod system. The medical records and the preoperative and postoperative radiographs were reviewed. Preoperative and postoperative computed tomography scans were used to specify the fracture types and to assess the reduction. RESULTS: All nine patients with a mean age of 50.3 years successfully underwent surgery with this technique, and a follow-up of 17.4 +/- 9.3 months was performed. Transverse atlantal ligament (TAL) injury was found in eight of the nine patients: one of type I and seven of type II. The preoperative LMD averaged 7.0 +/- 2.2 mm and was restored completely after surgery; all the fractures achieved bony healing without loss of reduction or implant failure. None of the patients had complications of neurologic deficit, vertebral artery injury, or wound infection associated with the surgical procedure. Two patients complained of greater occipital nerve neuralgia after the operation, which gradually disappeared in 1 month. All patients had a well-preserved range of motion of the upper cervical spine at the final follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Posterior osteosynthesis with a monoaxial screw-rod system is capable of an almost anatomical reduction for the unstable atlas fractures. The TAL incompetence may not be a contraindication to ORIF for C1 fractures, but the long-term effect of C1-C2 instability remains to be further investigated. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Cutaneous hypoesthesia following plate fixation in clavicle fractures	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Clavicle fracture; surgical fixation; cutaneous hypoesthesia; numbness; supraclavicular nerve	SKIN FLAP NUMBNESS	Background: We report the functional impact and natural history of cutaneous hypoesthesia after plate internal fixation for mid shaft clavicle fractures with a horizontal skin incision from year 2009 to 2011. Materials and Methods: 38 patients had complete followup data with an average followup period of 23.2 months (range 8-43 months). The impact of supraclavicular nerve injury was studied by assessment of the incidence, functional impact and natural history of numbness with detailed review of the case records and phone questionnaires. Results: The incidence of postoperative numbness was 55.3% (n = 21). Most patients reported the numbness to be at its worst within the first operative month. At the time of worst numbness, 28.6% (n = 6/21) of patients reported the numbness to be severe while 42.9% (n = 9/21) reported moderate numbness and 28.6% (n = 6/21) reported mild numbness. Fifteen of these patients described increased awareness of numbness during contact with straps or clothes. Two patients were significantly bothered by this numbness; 4 patients stated that it was a moderate bother while 7 patients considered it a mild bother. A total of 8 patients reported that they were not bothered at all by the numbness. An overwhelming majority of affected patients (90.5%, n = 19/21) reported an improvement in the severity of numbness felt over time. At the last followup, the incidence of numbness declined from 55.3% to 36.8% with 7 patients reporting complete resolution of numbness. The numbness however was found to persist in 66.7% of patients. Only 1 patient reported continued severe numbness. The awareness of numbness with straps and clothing was severe in 5 patients. None of the patients were significantly bothered by this numbness. Conclusions: Cutaneous sensory loss is a common occurrence following plate fixation of the clavicle and might have been under reported in the literature. The numbness improves in the vast majority, but commonly persists to some degree for up to 2 years and maybe permanent. However, only a small minority eventually considered the numbness a significant "bother" and to affect them while wearing clothing or when in contact with shoulder straps.

Materials and Methods: Twelve pairs of formalin-treated cadaveric humeri were used. One side in each pair was for cemented group, while the other side was for the control group. The bone mineral density (BMD) of the samples was tested. A 3-part facture model was created and then reduced and fixed by a locking plate system. In the cemented group, the most proximal 4 screw holes were filled with 0.5 mL bone cement. In the control group, the screw holes were not filled by cement. Locking screws were inserted in a standard manner before the cement hardened. X-ray was taken before all the specimens being subjected to mechanical study, in which 6 pairs were used for axial loading (varus bending) test, while other 6 pairs were used for axial rotational test. Results: There is no difference in BMD between the cemented side and the control side. The X-ray shows that the implant is in position. Cement filling was noted in the most proximal 4 screws in the cemented group. Better mechanical outcome was seen in the cemented groups, in terms of less maximal displacement per cycle and higher failure point and stiffness in varus bending test. However, no difference was found between the cemented group and the control group in the axial rotation test. Discussion: In similarity with the previous studies, our results showed better mechanical results in the cemented group. However, due to the limitations (e.g. sample size, fracture model, testing protocol, etc), we still cannot directly extrapolate current mechanical results to clinical practice at the present moment. Furthermore, it is still unknown whether better primary outcome may lead to better long-term results, even though the local release of strontium may enhance the local bone formation.

Preoperative Radiographic Factors and Surgeon Experience Are Associated With Cortical Breach of C2 Pedicle Screws	JOURNAL OF SPINAL DISORDERS & TECHNIQUES			English	Article						C2; pedicle screw; breach; violation; complication; radiographic; preoperative CT; morphometric; surgeon experience	VERTEBRAL ARTERY INJURY; TRANSARTICULAR SCREW; ANATOMIC CONSIDERATIONS; COMPARATIVE ACCURACY; THORACIC SPINE; LAMINAR SCREWS; FIXATION; PLACEMENT; RISK; INSTRUMENTATION	Study Design: A retrospective review study. Objective: In this study, we attempt to identify radiographic variables associated with likelihood of intraoperative breach during C2 pedicle screw placement. In addition, we attempt to correlate surgeon experience with breach rate. Summary of Background Data: Pedicle screws have emerged as an effective approach for obtaining fixation of the axis, yet placement of C2 pedicle screws is technically demanding and poses the risk of injury to the vertebral artery. Given the evidence for substantial variation in C2 anatomy, preoperative assessment of computed tomography (CT) scans may indicate, which patients are at increased risk for cortical breach during the pedicle screw placement. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of all patients undergoing C2 pedicle screw fixation at a single institution over the last 6 years was conducted. Radiographic cortical breaches were defined on postoperative CT scans as visualization of the screw beyond the cortical edge. Radiographic measurements were determined from preoperative CT scans and were then correlated with breaches via Student t test. The association of breach rate with surgeon experience was evaluated using univariate linear regression. Results: Ninety-three patients underwent placement of 170 screws. Cortical breach was detected on postoperative CT scans in 43 screws (25.3%). One clinically significant breach occurred with damage to the left vertebral artery intraoperatively. On axial CT sections, mean pedicle isthmus diameter was significantly smaller in patients with breach than in patients without breach for both left and right sides, P = 0.006 and P = 0.010, respectively. Specifically, a diameter of less than 6 mm was associated with a nearly 2-fold increase in risk of cortical breach (37% vs. 21%). Surgeons with greater experience in placing C2 pedicle screws were noted to have a lower breach incidence (P = 0.004). Conclusions: During placement of C2 pedicle screws, likelihood of cortical breach may be associated with size of pedicle and surgeon experience. Extensive preoperative evaluation of CT scans and consideration of technical demands of procedure may help avoid complications with such internal fixation.

In the present study, a novel spinal robotic system with automatic drilling power was introduced. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety in pedicle screw insertion of posterior lumbar interbody fusion assisted by this novel robotic system. Methods and materials: A randomised controlled trial was conducted for 17 participants who were required posterior lumbar interbody fusion process. Seven (3 M/4 F) were randomly assigned to the robot-assisted group (RA group), and the other ten (4 M/6 F) were assigned to the conventional technique group (FH group). A novel robotic system was used in the RA group. All measurements were based on postoperative computed tomography (CT) data. Accuracy of screw insertion was determined using the Gertzbein and Robbins Scale. Precision was measured by the entry point deviation distance and the trajectory rotation. Other variables included operation time, radiation time, length of stay, and screw-related complications. Result: A total of 82 pedicle screws were placed in the 17 participants. In the RA group, 90.6% of screws placed were Grade A, and 9.4% were Grade B. In the FH group, 78.0% of screws were Grade A, 20.0% were Grade B, and 2.0% were Grade C. No statistical difference was found in the operation time, radiation time per case, and length of stay between both groups. The radiation time per screw is significantly lower in the RA group. No screw-related complications or revision occurred in the present study. Conclusion: The outcome of screw accuracy of this robotic system was comparable with that of experienced surgeons, and no screw-related complication was found in the RA group during hospitalisation. In addition, radiation time per screw in the robotic group was significantly lower than that in the conventional group, which shows the potential to reduce radiation exposure of pedicle screw fixation assisted by this robotic system. Translational potential: Our study shows that pedicle screw fixation assisted by "Orthbot' system is accurate and safe. It is concluded that this novel robotic system offers a new option for internal implantation in spine surgery.

Materials and methods Eighty patients with supracondylar fractures of the femur were treated from January 1994 to June 2000 and 72 of them followed up completely. There were 25 (34%) men and 47 (65%) women with a median age of 73.2 years (range 60-88 years). In patients with the same type of fracture, the chosen method was random, one after the other (alternately). RIN was used in 35 patients, and DCS was used in 37. The mean operative time for the DCS fixation group was 145 min (range 115-180 min), whereas for the RIN group it was 92 min (range 76-110 min) (p < 0.001) with an average estimated blood loss of 310 cc (range 120-450 cc) and 118 cc (range 90-165 cc), respectively (p < 0.001). The mean follow-up was 28 months (range 18-42 months). Results According to the criteria set by Schatzker and Lambert, excellent results were recorded in 18 (51%), good in 11 (31%), moderate in 3 (9%), poor in 3 (9%) patients with RIN and excellent in 19 (51%), good in 11 (30%), moderate in 4 (11%) and poor in 3 (8%) patients with DCS (p > 0.05). The complications that occurred in the RIN group were 2 (6%) stiffness of the knee (mean flexion 80 degrees), 2 (6%) non-unions, 2 (6%) varus deformity and in the DCS group 2 (5%) haematomas, 4 (11%) stiffness of the knee (mean flexion 73 degrees) and 2 (5%) non-unions. Conclusion Although the two methods appear to have the same percentage of excellent results and same time to bony union, RIN is preferable to DCS in terms of less blood loss and shorter operating time.

Materials and Methods: This was a prospective institutional review board-approved study involving 20 adult patients who presented to the university emergency department or oral and maxillofacial surgical clinic with uncomplicated mandible fractures. Patients who met the exclusion criteria consented to enter the study in the open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) or the closed (MMF) study group. Six to 8 MMF screws were used to obtain intermaxillary fixation (IMF) in the 2 groups. Screw failure was documented. All screws were removed at 5 to 6 weeks postoperatively. Insertional torque (IT) was measured at time of screw placement to assess primary stability. Clinical and photographic documentation was performed to assess fracture healing, occlusion, and gingival health. Ten-centimeter visual analog scales were used to assess patient-centered outcomes. Cone-beam computed tomography was performed to assess the long-term effects on the periodontium and roots. A cost comparison was performed to determine whether the use of screws was cost effective compared with arch bars. Results: Fifteen men and 5 women (mean age, 25.2 yr) entered the study. All patients displayed adequate fracture healing based on clinical examination. All patients had acceptable occlusion at 5 to 6 weeks postoperatively. Total screw failure was 27 of 106 screws (25.5%). Forty percent of screws placed in the MMF group failed compared with only 6% in the ORIF group. Gingival health scores were favorable. Factors that had a significant effect on screw failure included a lower IT (P = .002), use in closed (MMF) treatment (P < .001), and use in the posterior jaw (P = .012). Minimal pain was associated with the MMF screws and pre-existing occlusion was re-established based on patients' subjective responses. The MMF group reported a statistically significant lower quality of life (P < .001) compared with the ORIF group. There was only 1 screw site that had a facial cortical bone defect noted at 6-month follow-up CBCT examination. There were no discernible long-term root defects. Cost analysis showed that the use of MMF screws saved around $600 per patient in operating room usage cost alone compared with the estimated use of arch bars. Conclusions: Uncomplicated mandible fractures were successfully treated using MMF screws in open and closed treatments. However, the utility in closed treatment was decreased because of significant screw failure and patient noncompliance. The screws were well tolerated by the patients. There was minimal long-term damage to the periodontium and dental roots. The cost of screws was more than offset by time savings.

A wide range of different techniques for augmentation has been described to improve the primary and secondary stability. Nevertheless, comparative analyses on the specific advantages and limitations are missing. Therefore, the aim of the present article was to systematically review and evaluate the current biomechanical and clinical studies.Materials and methodsThe databases of PubMed and EMBASE were comprehensively searched for studies on augmentation techniques for proximal humeral fractures using defined search terms. Subsequently, all articles identified were screened for eligibility and subdivided in either clinical or biomechanical studies. Furthermore, the level of evidence and study quality were assessed according the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine and the Coleman Methodology Score, respectively.ResultsOut of 2788, 15 biomechanical and 30 clinical studies were included. The most common techniques were structural allogenic or autologous bone grafting to enhance the medial support, metaphyseal void filling utilizing synthetic bone substitutes or bone grafts, and screw-tip augmentation with bone cement. Biomechanical data were available for structural bone grafting to enhance the medial support, void filling with synthetic bone substitutes, as well as for screw-tip augmentation. Clinical evidence ranged from level II-IV and study quality was 26-70/100 points. Only one clinical study was found investigating screw-tip augmentation. All studies included revealed that any kind of augmentation positively enhances mechanical stability, reduces the rate of secondary dislocation, and improves patients' clinical outcome. None of the studies showed relevant augmentation-associated complication rates.ConclusionsAugmentation of plate fixation for proximal humeral fractures seems to be a reliable and safe procedure. All common techniques mechanically increase the constructs' stability. Clinically evaluated procedures show reduced complication rates and improved patient outcomes. Augmentation techniques seem to have the highest significance in situations of reduced bone mineral density and in high-risk fractures, such as 4-part fractures. However, more high-quality and comparative clinical trials are needed to give evidence-based treatment recommendations.

The aim of this study was to compare the passivity of implant superstructures by assessing the strain development around the internal tapered connection implants with strain gauges. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A polyurethane resin block in which two implants were embedded served as a measurement model. Two groups of implant restorations utilized cement-retained design and internal surface of the first group was adjusted until premature contact between the restoration and the abutment completely disappeared. In the second group, only nodules detectable to the naked eye were removed. The third group employed screw-retained design and specimens were generated by computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing system (n=10). Four strain gauges were fixed on the measurement model mesially and distally to the implants. The strains developed in each strain gauge were recorded during fixation of specimens. To compare the difference among groups, repeated measures 2-factor analysis was performed at a level of significance of alpha=.05. RESULTS. The absolute strain values were measured to analyze the magnitude of strain. The mean absolute strain value ranged from 29.53 to 412.94 mu m/m at the different strain gauge locations. According to the result of overall comparison, the cement-retained prosthesis groups exhibited significant difference. No significant difference was detected between milled screw-retained prostheses group and cement-retained prosthesis groups. CONCLUSION. Within the limitations of the study, it was concluded that the cement-retained designs do not always exhibit lower levels of stress than screw-retained designs. The internal adjustment of a cement-retained implant restoration is essential to achieve passive fit.

Forces across the middle of the intact clavicle during shoulder motion	JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY			English	Article						Clavicle; clavicle fracture; clavicle force, glenohumeral motion	BIOMECHANICAL EVALUATION; FRACTURES	Hypothesis: The optimal management of displaced middle third clavicle fractures is currently under investigation Advances in fracture fixation technology have expanded the indications for operative fracture management Data are currently unavailable regarding the normal forces and moments that occur in the middle clavicle with motion of the glenohumeral joint This study tested our null hypothesis that active range of motion in internal rotation, external rotation, and abduction would produce a similar magnitude of force across the middle clavicle Materials and methods: Clavicle forces were measured in 6 whole fresh frozen cadavers using a 6 degree-of-freedom load cell mounted to the middle third of the clavicle The rotator cuff tendons were isolated, divided, and connected to a system of weights The forces across the clavicle in 3 orthogonal directions were quantified during simulated active abduction, internal rotation, and external rotation. Results: There were statistically greater axial compressive force and torque in the clavicle during humeral abduction compared with internal or external rotation During external rotation, there were statistically greater tensile forces compared with abduction or internal rotation. There were no statistical differences in the superior-inferior or anterior-posterior forces with the 3 motions studied. Discussion: Overall, active abduction caused the greatest increase in middle clavicle forces and torque Abduction resulted in the most significant axial compressive force, whereas active external rotation caused the greatest tensile force across the intact middle clavicle. Conclusions: To our knowledge. these findings represent the first results describing the forces across the intact clavicle during glenohumeral motion These data can be used to aid clinicians in treating these fractures, guide the design of future biomechanical studies, and develop rehabilitation protocols Level of evidence: Basic Science Study (C) 2010 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

Material and methods In a retrospective comparative study, 75 patients were treated with the Ilizarov technique for aseptic posttraumatic pseudarthrosis of the tibia in the period 2000-2016. We compared them with the 51 patients from the control group, treated for tibial bone union disturbances using internal osteosynthesis methods, i.e., internal-fixation plates and intramedullary nails. The study groups were compared in terms of the rates of union, time to union, and the baseline-to-postoperative difference in lower leg deformity. Results Union rate in the Ilizarov group was 100% and the control group was 51.92% (p < 0.001). The median time to union suggests that patients from the Ilizarov group needed a shorter time to achieve bone union (203.00 days vs. 271.00 days) (p = 0.091). The effect size in the Ilizarov group was larger both in terms of reducing both limb deformity and shortening (it is worth noting, however, that the Ilizarov treatment was used in patients with higher baseline values of both these parameters). We observed no significant difference in terms of time to union between the group of patients with at least one risk factor for disturbance in fracture healing and the group with no risk factors. The following risk factors were considered: diabetes mellitus, corticosteroid therapy, smoking, alcohol dependence, and advanced lower-extremity vascular disease (p = 0.827). Discussion Our study demonstrated a high effectiveness of the Ilizarov method in the treatment of aseptic posttraumatic pseudarthroses of the tibia. The Ilizarov method seems to be worth considering in all cases where either the patient or the nature of injury is associated with additional risk factors and whenever there is a need for leg deformity correction or leg elongation.

Internal Rotation Traction Radiograph Improves Proximal Femoral Fracture Classification Accuracy and Agreement	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY			English	Article						hip fracture; intertrochanteric fracture; proximal femoral fracture; subcapital fracture; traction radiograph	INTRACAPSULAR FRACTURES; FEMUR; FIXATION; INTEROBSERVER; RELIABILITY; WORLDWIDE; NECK; HIP	OBJECTIVE. The objective of this study is to assess the clinical utility of internal rotation traction radiography in the classification of proximal femoral fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The study cohort included 78 consecutive patients who were surgically treated for a proximal femoral fracture and for whom preoperative physician-assisted internal rotation traction radiographs of the fractured hip were obtained in addition to standard radiographs. Two radiologists who were blinded to clinical information independently classified each fracture without the traction view and then with the traction view. The radiologists also reported their confidence (expressed as a percentage) in their classifications. The reference standard was the consensus interpretation of intraoperative C-arm fluoroscopic images by two orthopedic surgeons and one radiologist. Classification accuracy was compared using the McNemar test. Subjective confidence and confidence-weighted accuracy were compare using paired t tests. Agreement with the reference standard and interreader agreement were calculated using the kappa statistic and were compared using the z-test after bootstrapping was performed to obtain the standard error. RESULTS. With the traction view, the pooled accuracy increased from 44.9% to 72.4%, subjective confidence increased from 87% to 94%, and confidence-weighted accuracy increased from 51.7% to 74.3% (p < 0.001). With the traction view, the kappa statistic for agreement with the reference standard increased from 0.530 to 0.791 and from 0.381 to 0.625 for the two readers, and interreader agreement increased from 0.480 to 0.678 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION. The addition of an internal rotation traction radiographic view significantly improves radiologist accuracy and confidence as well as interreader agreement in the classification of proximal femoral fractures, all of which would be expected to best guide appropriate surgical management.

Optimal configuration for stability and magnetic resonance imaging quality in temporary external fixation of tibial plateau fractures	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Tibial plateau fracture; External fixation stability; Magnetic resonance imaging; Image artifact	MECHANICAL PERFORMANCE; MRI; STIFFNESS; FIXATORS; DEVICES; SAFETY; MANAGEMENT; ARTIFACTS; OSTEOTOMY	Introduction: Temporary external fixation has been widely utilized in the stabilization of plateau fractures while waiting for an optimization of the soft tissue conditions before subsequent permanent internal fixation. Simultaneously, MRI is beneficial in the assessment of concomitant damage to ligaments and menisci so that these injuries could be promptly identified, and surgical planning executed at the time of definitive fixation of the bony injury. Increasing numbers of side-bars and pins have been previously suggested to increase frame rigidity, but at the same time, several studies have indicated the presence of MRI artifacts which may obscure key anatomical structures, even when MRI-compatible fixation devices are used. This study aims to identify, among six potential configurations, the construct that maximizes stability while most minimizing the number of MRI artifacts generated among different configurations commonly used. Hypothesis: There is one or more configurations among the others that maximize stability while preserving a clinically acceptable level of MRI quality. Material and methods: Six constructs were recreated on cadaveric specimens and identified by the disposition of the bars: H, Anterior, Flash, Hashtag, Rhomboid, and Diamond. Stage one evaluated the amount of artifact produced during MRI on instrumented cadaveric legs, as well as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) at five specific regions of interest. Stage two assessed the amount of compressional and torsional stiffness of the configurations on bone surrogate models. Results: Image artifacts were not detected within the knee joint for all considered constructs. In terms of SNR The H, Anterior, Hashtag, and Diamond configurations were not significantly different from their control (p > 0.366) while the others were significantly different (p < 0.03). The values of CNR found for the H and Hashtag configurations were not significantly different from their controls (p > 0.07) while the remaining configurations were significantly different (p < 0.03). In compression, the H and Diamond configurations had similar stiffness (p = 0.468) of 35.78 N/mm and 31.44 N/mm, respectively, and were stiffer than the other configurations. In torsion, the constructs have shown different stiffness (p < 0.001) with a minimum value of 0.66 Nm/deg for the Rhomboid configuration, which was significantly less stiff than the Anterior configuration (1.20 Nm/deg [p < 0.001]). There was no difference between the Diamond and H configurations (p = 0.177) or between them and the Hashtag configuration (p = 0.215). Discussion: An external fixator construct directly bridging the femur and tibia without interconnections is the most stable and produces MRI scans without image artifacts that would interfere with diagnostic quality.

In this study, two types of marine raw materials were screened: Oceanic Manganese Nodules (OMN) and Deep-sea Sediments (DSS), and prepared the spherical regenerative adsorption materials OMN@SA, DSS@SA and OMN&DSS@SA using sodium alginate (SA) by sol-gel method. Preliminary investigations on the adsorption effect of metal ions were carried out. OMN@SA exhibited the best adsorption capacity, with the adsorption quantities for Cu2+, Co2+ and Ni2+ reaching 31.12, 21.11 and 16.66 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption behaviour is consistent with the Langmuir, pseudo-second-order kinetics and particle diffusion model, indicating that the adsorption process is mainly spontaneous, monolayer chemical adsorption, and the adsorption rate is mainly controlled by internal particle diffusion. SEM-EDS, XRD, FTIR and XPS analyses suggest that the adsorption mechanism includes surface physical adsorption, ion exchange, functional group complexation, electrostatic attraction and precipitation. The fixed bed column experiment shows that OMN@SA can effectively remove metal ions Cu2+, demonstrating excellent stability, safety and good regenerability. This study paves a new direction for the design of efficient and sustainable materials for heavy metal adsorption. More importantly, as marine primordial materials, OMN and DSS have strong technical and economic feasibility for future use in in situ fixation of metal ions in seafloor sediments and restoration of the original seabed environment.

Although reactivity to SS and cpTi are noted in reference, the soft tissue compatibility of TAN has not been comprehensively studied. This study focuses on the in vitro soft tissue compatibility of TAN in comparison to SS and cpTi using a human fibroblast model. The industrial standard surface finishes of these three materials vary considerably in view of their use in similar applications. To distinguish between material parameters of topography and chemistry, we have included electropolished (e.p) counterparts of the standard preparations of cpTi and TAN in the study (standard SS is e.p). All materials were characterized using atomic force microscopy, profilometry, and scanning electron microscopy. Our findings demonstrate that cell morphology and growth rate was similar for SS, and e.p. cpTi and TAN, with cells well spread and forming a confluent monolayer by 10 days. Cell growth on standard cpTi was similar to the electropolished samples; however, they showed a less spread morphology with more filopodia and surface ruffling present. Cell morphology on standard TAN was rounded or elongated and proliferation was inhibited at all time points, with possible cell necrosis by day 10. We found evidence of endocytosis of beta-phase particles originating from the standard TAN surface. We believe that the particle uptake coupled with the characteristic surface topography contribute to the noncytocompatibility of fibroblasts on standard TAN. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The exact pathomechanism is not completely understood; however, microbial colonization of osteosynthesis material is considered a trigger for infection. This study aimed to determine the colonization rate of osteosynthesis implants in patients with no clinical or laboratory signs of infection, using two methods, conventional culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of sonication fluid. Fifty-seven patients aged between 18 and 79 years without signs of infection who underwent routine removal of osteosynthesis devices between March 2015 and May 2017 were included in this study. Osteosynthesis material was investigated by sonication followed by cultivation of the sonication fluid in blood culture bottles and PCR analysis, simultaneously. Additionally, electron scanning microscopy was performed in nine representative implants to evaluate biofilm production. Thirty-two (56.1%) implants showed a positive result either by culture or PCR with coagulase-negative staphylococci being the most commonly identified microorganism (68.1%). Furthermore, the detection rate of the culture (50.9%) was significantly higher compared to PCR (21.1%). The scanning electron microscopy imaging demonstrated biofilm-like structures in four of six culture and/or PCR-positive samples. This study is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to demonstrate bacterial colonization of osteosynthesis implants in healthy patients with no clinical or laboratory signs of infection. Colonization rate was unexpectedly high and conventional culture was superior to PCR in microbial detection. The common understanding that colonization is a trigger for infection underlines the need for strategies to prevent colonization of implant material like antibiotic-loaded coating or intraoperative gel application.

Design: Retrospective medical record review. Setting: Academic level 1 Trauma Center; 2-year period. Patients/Participants:Current Procedure Terminology codes for open treatment of bimalleolar ankle and bicondylar tibial plateau fractures identified patients. Patients who had operative treatment of other injuries under the same anesthetic session were excluded. Only definitive treatment procedures were analyzed. Intervention: We analyzed the intraoperative material costs of these procedures and compared them between surgeons. This analysis was done with a newly developed proprietary program designed for inventory and cost analysis. Main Outcome Measurements: Mean and median total case material costs were compared using one-way analysis of variance. Individual items that significantly increased costs were identified. Results: We identified 88 bimalleolar ankle and 46 bicondylar tibial plateau fractures treated by 6 surgeons. The mean intraoperative material cost per bimalleolar ankle fracture was $1099. The least expensive surgeon's mean case cost was $613, which was significantly less than the most expensive surgeon's $2243 (P = 0.009). The median cost range was $598-$784. The top quartile of cases resulted in 57% of overall material cost for ankle fractures. The mean intraoperative material cost per bicondylar tibial plateau fracture was $3219 (range $1839-$4088, P = 0.064). The range of median costs ($1826-$3989) was significantly wider than for ankle fractures. Bone void fillers, locking plates, adjunctive external fixators, minifragment locking plates, cannulated screws, single-use taps, guidewires, and drill bits all substantially increased costs. Conclusion: This study demonstrated variation in intraoperative material cost between 6 traumatologists resulting from practice variations despite similar specialty training. The cost differences resulting from practice variation reveal potential savings through increased standardization of surgical care for similar injuries. We identified high-cost items, which could lead to cost savings if used only when they will have clinical benefit.

Material and methodsEighty 6-mm-diameter defects were created in the calvaria of 20 New Zealand rabbits (4 defects per rabbit calvaria). All the defects were filled with particles of synthetic bone. Two standardized compressive forces were then applied, 4.1g to half the defects (Test A) and 8.2g to the other half (Test B), all for 1min. The graft sites were allowed to heal for 6weeks, after which the rabbits were euthanized. The calvarium vault of each animal was extracted, radiographed, and prepared for histomorphometric analysis. The percentage of defect fill, bone density, new bone formation, and residual bone graft material were recorded, and the results were subjected to statistical analysis. ResultsHistological evaluation found that defect closure among the Test A (lower compression) group ranged from 38.34 (95% lower CI) to 55.8 (95% upper CI) (mean 478.5%), while among the Test B group (higher compression), it ranged from 81.26 (95% lower CI) to 95.32 (mean 88 +/- 7.3%). Significantly more closure was achieved for the Test B group (P<0.05). Histomorphometric comparison of the two groups found significantly more new bone formation, higher bone density, and a higher percentage of defect fill in the defects subjected to the higher compression level (P<0.05). ConclusionsIncreasing the compressive force applied to bone graft particulate used to fill small defects created in rabbit calvaria appears to be beneficial.

A cadaveric study	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Anterior pelvic internal fixation; INFIX; Femoral nerve; Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve; Injury	FEMORAL CUTANEOUS NERVE; EXTERNAL FIXATOR; FRACTURES; SERIES	Introduction: Anterior pelvic internal fixator (INFIX) is used to treat unstable pelvic ring injuries. Nerve injury complications with this procedure have been reported. Objectives: This anatomic study attempted to identify structures at risk after application of INFIX. Materials and methods: INFIX was applied in fifteen fresh, frozen, anatomical specimens using polyaxial pedicular screws and subcutaneous rods. Surgical dissection was done to identify the structures at risk including the femoral nerve (FN), femoral artery (FA), femoral vein (FV) and the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) related to which are potentially affected by the implant. Results: All structures at risk were closer to the rod than to the pedicular screw. Measurements were made between the rod and the structures at risk. The LFCN was an average of 13.49 +/- 1.65 mm (95% CI 12.871-14.103) from the lateral end of the rod. The FN was an average of 12.43 +/- 3.42 mm (95% CI 11.151-13.709), the FA was an average of 12.80 +/- 3.67 (95% CI 11.430-14.173) and the FV was an average of 13.48 +/- 3.73 (95% CI 12.082-14.871) below the rod. No direct compression of the rod to the structure at risk was observed. Conclusions: The femoral nerve is the structure most at risk of compression by the INFIX rod. Careful surgical technique is required in every step of this surgery. We suggest using polyaxial screws and recommend that during screw insertion the surgeon should leave some space between the screw and rectus fascia. The the rod should be trimmed as short as possible to reduce LFCN irritation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study reports the results of the fixation of pathologic fractures secondary to osteomyelitis using the "internal fixator technique." Methods: The internal fixator technique was performed on 11 children and adolescents with fractures secondary to osteomyelitis between 2003 and 2010. A retrospective chart review was conducted to record the following: age, sex, the anatomic region of infection, the time delay from symptom onset to fracture, the classification of chronic osteomyelitis, the Cierny-Mader classification, the causative organism, surgeries, the length of hospitalization, the location and the pattern of fracture, the duration of infection, the length of follow-up, and complications. Results: The patients included 7 male and 4 female patients with a mean age of 8.7 (range, 6 to 13) years. Pathologic fractures were as follows: 7 femur and 4 tibia. Nine of them were in the metaphysis and 2 others were located in the diaphysis. The time delay from symptom onset to fracture was 3.36 (1 to 9) months. The anatomic region of infection was the diaphysis in 2 cases and the metaphysis in 9 cases. Fractures patterns were short oblique and transverse. The length of hospitalization was a mean of 7 days. The duration of infection ranged from 1 to 12 (mean, 4.38) months. The mean duration of follow-up was 57.09 (range, 36 to 73) months from the initial presentation. Only 2 patients developed shortening, for which no additional intervention was performed. Conclusions: This case series demonstrates that the "internal fixator technique" is an acceptable alternative to the management of pathologic fractures of the femur or the tibia in children and adolescents with unresolved acute and chronic osteomyelitis. Infections were resolved in all cases and fractures were sufficiently stabilized to allow union with a low complication rate.				yildirimazad@gmail.com	CACAN, MEHMETAKIF/LFS-5276-2024; alemdar, celil/JHS-3229-2023	alemdar, celil/0000-0001-6188-5867; yigit, seyhmus/0000-0002-7290-6798; Cacan, Mehmet Akif/0000-0003-2587-6327					27	7	9	0	1	LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS	PHILADELPHIA	TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA	0271-6798	1539-2570		J PEDIATR ORTHOPED	J.

In the present work, copper (Cu) is added in Fe-Mn system to enhance the degradation rate and antimicrobial properties. Fe-Mn-xCu (x = 0.9, 5 and 10 wt.%) alloys are prepared by the melting-casting-forging route. XRD analysis confirms austenite phase stabilization due to the presence of Mn and Cu. As predicted by Thermo-Calc calculations, Cu rich phase precipitations are noticed along the austenite grain boundaries. Degradation behaviours of Cu added Fe-Mn alloys are investigated through static immersion and electrochemical polarization where enhanced degradation is found for higher Cu added alloys. When challenged against E.Coli bacteria, the Fe-Mn-Cu alloy media extract shows a significant bactericidal effect compare to the base alloy. In vitro cytocompatibility studies, as determined using MG63 and MC3T3-E1 cell lines, indicate increased cell density as a function of time for all the alloys. When implanted in rabbit femur, the newly developed alloy does not show any kind of tissue necrosis around the implants. Better osteogenesis and higher new bone formation are observed with Fe-Mn-10Cu alloy as evident from micro-computed tomography (mu-CT) and fluorochrome labelling.

Biomechanical comparison of polylactide-based versus titanium miniplates in mandible reconstruction in vitro	JOURNAL OF STOMATOLOGY ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article						Polylactide; Mandible reconstruction; Fibula free flap; Fatigue strength; Biomechanics; Mechanical integrity	MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY; BIODEGRADABLE PLATES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; STRENGTH; SYSTEMS; DEVICES; SCREWS	Objectives: Evaluation of the mechanical integrity and reliability of polylactide-based miniplates for osseous free flap fixation at the mandible in an experimental study setup of a mandible reconstruction model. Material and methods: 1.0 mm titanium miniplates (group TI) (MatrixMandible, DePuy Synthes, Umkirch, Germany) and 1.5 mm polylactide miniplates (group PL) (Inion CPS, Inion Oy, Tampere, Finland) were used to fix a polyurethane (PU) fibula segment to a PU mandible reconstruction model using monocortical non-locking screws. Mastication was simulated via unilateral cyclic dynamic loading at 1 Hz with increasing loads (+ 0.15 N/cycle, Bionix, MTS, USA). A 3D optical tracking system (Aramis, GOM, Braunschweig, Germany) was used to determine interosteotomy movements (IOM). Results: IOM were higher in the polylactide group (distal: P = 0.001, mesial: P = 0.001). Differences in mean stiffness (titanium: 478 + 68 N/mm; polylactide: 425 + 38 N/mm, P = 0.240) and mean force at a vertical displacement of 1.0 mm (titanium: 201.6 + 87.1 N; polylactide: 141.3 + 29.9 N, P= 0.159) were not significant. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that polylactide-based miniplates provide reduced mechanical integrity and higher interosteotomy movements in comparison to titanium miniplates in vitro. Indications for clinical use of polylactide-based miniplates in mandible reconstruction have to be placed critically. Future studies will focus on clinical complications of polylactide-based plates in risk patients. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

This study determined how pullout strength is affected by placing different bone screws at varying angles in normal and OP bone models. Pullout tests of screws placed axially, and at angles to the pullout axis (ranging from 10 degrees to 40 degrees), were performed in 0.09 g cm(-3), 0.16 g cm(-3) and 0.32 g cm(-3) polyurethane (PU) foam. Two different titanium alloy bone screws were used to test for any effect of thread type (i.e. cancellous or cortical) on the screw pullout strength. The cancellous screw required a significantly higher pullout force than the cortical screw (p<0.05). For both screws, pullout strength significantly increased with increasing PU foam density (p<0.05). For screws placed axially, and sometimes at 10 degrees, the observed mechanism of failure was stripping of the internal screw threads generated within the PU foam by screw insertion. For screws inserted at 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 300 and 40 degrees, the resistance to pullout force was observed to be by compression of the PU foam material above the angled screw; clinically, this suggests that compressed OP bone is stronger than unloaded OP bone.

J	Babu, SK				Babu, Senthil Kumar			Morphological and morphometric study of scaphoid bone in South Indian population	JOURNAL OF THE ANATOMICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA			English	Article						Fracture; morphological variations; morphometry; scaphoid	NATURAL-HISTORY; ANATOMY; WRIST	Introduction: Scaphoid fractures are the most common of the carpal bone injuries. Scaphoid fractures heal slowly due to the limited blood circulation of the bone. To avoid malunion, the scaphoid fracture has to be recognized in time and treated either by immobilization or by surgical fixation. The present study was carried out to observe the morphological variations of scaphoid and measure its dimensions and also to observe the position and number of nutrient foramen in the scaphoid bone. Material and Methods: A total of 100 dried adult human scaphoid bones were studied from the Department of Anatomy, VMKV Medical College and Hospital, to identify the possible morphological variations. The morphometry of scaphoid was measured using vernier caliper. The number of foramina was observed using a magnifying lens. The shape of tubercle, dorsal sulcus, and foramina on the dorsal sulcus were also observed and noted. The morphometric parameters were compared by Student's t-test on both the sides. Results: Of the 100 scaphoid bones studied, the tubercles were present in all the bones. Most of the scaphoid tubercles were conical and some were pyramidal in shape. All the scaphoid had main dorsal sulcus (54 scaphoids) and 46 scaphoids had two dorsal sulci. All the scaphoids had more than three foramina on the dorsal sulcus. Discussion and Conclusions: The morphological and morphometric data obtained from the scaphoid bone were compared with the previous studies, and the data may help the orthopedicians and radiologists for surgical reduction with internal fixation and to follow-up the reunion of fractured scaphoid bones.

J	Ge, JH; Chen, L; Xiang, Z				Ge, Jianhua; Chen, Long; Xiang, Zhou			Application of loop plating technique in fractures of ulna coronoid process	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Coronoid process fractures; dislocation; loop plating technique; internal fixation; ligament repairing	RADIAL HEAD; ELBOW; DISLOCATIONS; STABILITY; MANAGEMENT; INJURY	Objective: Although ulna coronoid process fracture is uncommon, it is a complex injury and its treatment remains difficult. This study assessed the clinical efficacy of loop plating technique, a potential method to treat ulna coronoid process fracture. Materials and Methods: Seven cases of ulna coronoid process fractures treated with loop plating technique from October 2012 to May 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. Patients' age ranged from 18-55 years (mean age 36 years). All cases were closed fractures. X-ray and 3D computed tomography were applied to all patients before surgery. After anteromedial incision, a homemade loop plate was fixed after satisfactory reduction of fractures. Lateral collateral ligament injuries were repaired and reconstructed in 4 cases and medial collateral ligament injury was repaired in 1 case during surgery because of elbow instability. Functional evaluation data were collected and analyzed statistically. Results: No patients suffered from delayed incision healing, redisplacement, fixation failure, or elbow joint instability. At last follow-up, mean Broberg and Morrey score was 94.1, Mayo Elbow Performance Index was 92.1, Ewald scoring system was 88.6 and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score was 5.4. During follow-up, only 1 patient had elbow heterotopic ossification (grade I-II). Conclusion: Application of loop plating technique might be a valid method for treatment of ulna coronoid process fractures, including various fracture styles, especially for comminuted fractures, but excluding simple coronion fractures of ulna coronoid process.

The authors aimed to examine the demographics, etiology, treatment, and outcomes of these fractures managed in a single pediatric trauma unit. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review was performed of patients presenting to a pediatric hospital between 2003 and 2016 with mandibular condyle fractures. Initial data was extracted from a dedicated trauma database. Included patient's medical records and imaging were then reviewed. Data on demographics, etiology, fracture type, and treatment were recorded. Univariate statistical analysis was performed. Results: Forty-four patients with 49 condyle fractures were included. The average age of patients was 11.4 years (range 3-15 years). A fall from a bicycle/scooter was the most common mechanism. Twenty-six fractures were isolated and 23 involved a further fracture of the mandibular arch. The condylar neck was the most common site of fracture (55%). There was no statistical significance between age (0-10 years, 10-16 years) and site of fracture or the presence of an associated arch fracture. The majority of isolated fractures (73%) were treated conservatively without inter-maxillary fixation. Thirty-nine patients attended the follow-up and the median follow-up period was 196 days (interquartile range 21-165 days). Two patients had a malocclusion at follow-up that required intervention. Conclusion: There was a broad range of presentations in our cohort. Conservative management in isolated fractures resulted in stable outcomes and this large case series supports the consensus that management of pediatric condyle fractures should be as conservative as possible.

Materials and Methods: The design of this research was a retrospective case-series study. Included were patients who 1) underwent open reduction and internal fixation of the condylar or subcondylar area through a retromandibular approach and 2) had a complete and available medical chart. Excluded were 1) patients treated endoscopically or by other approaches and 2) patients with preoperative facial paralysis. The data collected were age, gender, medical comorbidities, tobacco use, mechanism of injury, anatomic location, concomitant facial fractures, follow-up time, antibiotic protocol, and complications. Results: One hundred eight patients (81 male; 118 condyles; age, 13 to 82 yr; mean, 35.6 +/- 15.8 yr) met the inclusion criteria. Six patients never returned for postoperative visits and the mean follow-up time for all other patients was 6.5 months (8 days to 5.5 years). Twenty-six cases (22%) of temporary paralysis and 1 case of permanent facial paralysis were noted. Eight patients (6.8%) had persistent partial facial paralysis at their last visit, but all had short postoperative follow-ups. Fourteen cases (11.9%) of infection, 4 salivary fistulas, 2 sialoceles, 1 case of Frey syndrome, and 2 seromas were observed. Conclusion: The retromandibular approach is a safe method for the treatment of condylar process fractures and major complications are rare.

The Mandible Injury Severity Score: Development and validity	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							FRACTURE SCORE; COMPLICATIONS; PREDICT	Purpose: To develop and validate a clinical method for characterizing and scoring mandible injury severity. Materials and Methods: Constituent fracture variables (fracture type, location, occlusion, soft tissue involvement, infection, and interfragmentary displacement [FLOSID]) were used to develop the FLOSID taxonomy for characterizing injury. Each component was assigned an empirical weight to help derive a summary measure of injury severity called the UCLA Mandible Injury Severity Score (MISS). Subsequently, MISS values were calculated for a group of 336 patients treated for mandible fractures. The validity of the summary score was evaluated by relating the MISS measure to the treatment modality used and to various variables, related as well as unrelated to injury outcomes. Results: Each of the FLOSID components correlated significantly with the MISS (P < .001). Unrelated variables, including ethnicity, education, and gender, had no correlation to the MISS. On average, patients treated with rigid internal fixation had a higher MISS than patients treated with maxillomandibular fixation (P < .001). The MISS had a statistically significant association with surrogate markers of injury severity such as sensory nerve deficit, need for hospitalization, and pain at I-month follow-up (P < .001). However, there was no significant association between MISS and indicators of postoperative complications (infection, nonunion, malunion, malocclusion). Conclusions: The FLOSID taxonomy offers a useful alternative to narrative summarization of mandible injury. The MISS is readily derived from clinical parameters obtained at the initial patient encounter and appears to be a valid index of mandible injury severity across important clinical domains.

Recently, minimally invasive spine techniques have increased in popularity and have been applied to the Buck technique of direct pars repair. CASE DESCRIPTION: In our series, 2 patients underwent minimally invasive direct pars repair by the percutaneous insertion of a cannulated lag screw across the pars defect with compression against the lamina. The defect was then decorticated and packed with bone grafting material through a tubular retractor. The clinical records, including preoperative imaging characteristics and intraoperative variables, were collected. The first patient was a 22-year-old woman with bilateral pars defects, and the second was a 21-year-old woman with a left-sided pars defect. They underwent minimally invasive direct pars repair without complications and were discharged home within 24-48 hours. In the first patient, the fusion was successful; however, the second experienced screw back out and required subsequent revision. The follow-up period was 25 months for patient 1 and 21 months for patient 2. The fracture morphology differed. The successfully repaired fractures were linear with smooth cortical edges and oriented perpendicular to the screw trajectory. The failed repair involved a unilateral, curved defect with comminuted cortical edges. CONCLUSION: Minimally invasive direct pars repair can be performed safely and effectively with shortened hospital stays and reduced morbidity. Fracture morphology and orientation could be important predictors of the success of surgery.

Many guidelines for surgical treatment of different types of these fractures have been described. A conservative functional therapy is recommended as well as a closed or open reposition and internal fixation. Other authors prefer the primary prosthetic replacement of the displaced humeral head. The purpose of this article is to describe a minimal invasive technique-the intramedullary titanium helix wire-and to analyse results and specific problems of this method compared to other techniques. Materials and methods: In a prospective study done over a period of 5 years from 1998 to 2002, 97 patients with two-, three- and four-part-fractures of the proximal humerus were treated with the intramedullary titanium helix wire and given follow-up clinical and radiological checks after 12 months. The functional outcome was evaluated with a 1-year follow-up in 95 of 97 patients. Results: Our 1-year results include: 41 very good, 24 good, 16 satisfactory, 14 poor (average 76 points Constant functional score, 30.7 points UCLA score). Conclusion: The advantages of the method arising from the results lie in both the simple operation approach without nerve lesions or wound infections, and also in the indirect, intramedullary splinting of the fracture without damage to the surrounding soft parts, while iatrogenic necroses of the humeral head can be avoided.

In eight cases of fixation, we used u-HA/PLLA screws for maxillary alveolar ridge augmentation, for which mandibular cortical bone block was used in preimplantation surgery. Five appropriate samples with screws were evaluated histologically and immunohistochemically for runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), transcription factor Sp7 (Osterix), and leptin receptor (LepR). In all cases, histological evaluation revealed that bone components had completely surrounded the u-HA/PLLA screws, and the bone was connected directly to the biomaterial. Inflammatory cells did not invade the space between the bone and the u-HA/PLLA screw. Immunohistochemical evaluation revealed that many cells were positive for RUNX2 or Osterix, which are markers for osteoblast and osteoprogenitor cells, in the tissues surrounding u-HA/PLLA. In addition, many bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells were notably positive for both LepR and RUNX2. The u-HA/PLLA material showed excellent bioactive osteoconductivity and a highly biocompatibility with bone directly attached. In addition, our findings suggest that many bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and mature osteoblast are present in the osteogenic environment created with u-HA/PLLA screws and that this environment is suitable for osteogenesis.

The aim of this retrospective multicentre study was to survey and evaluate the characteristics of mandibular fractures, and dental injuries that occurred during the practice of baseball and softball in Sendai, Japan. Material and Methods The records of 454 patients with maxillofacial fractures from three departments of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery across a period 14 years were analysed. Fifty-one patients with 56 mandible fractures and dental injuries that occurred playing baseball or softball were included in this multicenter retrospective study. Patients were divided according to age, gender, sites of fractures, mechanism of fractures and treatment methods. Results There were 42 males and nine females, with a male-to-female ratio of 4.7:1.0. The mean age was 19.9 years old (range: 13-47 years old). As for the site, body of the mandible fractures prevailed, followed by the condyle, symphysis and angle. Fractures were mostly caused by the impact of a ball (42; 82.4%), followed by collisions with another player (5; 9.8%) and direct strike of a bat (4; 7.8%). All patients with mandibular fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation, except for six patients with condylar head fractures who were managed conservatively. Conclusions The impact of a thrown ball against the batter's mandible can cause a condylar fracture when playing baseball and softball.

Miniplates adapted to the alveolar processes were fixed monocortically with 6.0-mm-long titanium alloy screws, whereas miniplates placed near the mandible base were fixed bicortically. At 2, 6, and 12 weeks, mandible segments enclosing the RIF were removed, fixed in formalin, ground-sectioned, and stained with toluidine blue. Under conventional light microscopy, proportions of bone-to-screw contact (BSC) were determined, and data were compared by analysis of variance. Results: At 2 weeks, for both groups, the area between threads exhibited necrotic bone with multiple cracks and absence of bone cells and blood vessels. At 6 and 12 weeks, new Haversian systems progressively replaced necrotic bone. At each time point, no significant differences were seen between screws placed in the same miniplate or between groups. The proportions of BSC were statistically similar at 2 and 6 weeks and lower at 12 weeks. Conclusion: The results suggested that in this model, osteotomy did not significantly alter bone repair adjacent to the screw surface.

Clinical outcome of scaphoid malunion as a result of scaphoid fracture nonunion surgical treatment: A 5-year minimum follow-up study	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Scaphoid; Nonunion; Malunion; Reconstruction; Outcome	HERBERT-SCREW FIXATION; BONE-GRAFT; DEFORMITY	Background: Although malunion resulting from reconstruction for scaphoid fracture nonunion is a typical complication, there has been little consideration regarding its clinical outcomes. Hypothesis: The quality of restoration of the scaphoid anatomy may have little effect on clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods: Twenty-five patients with scaphoid fracture nonunion underwent curettage and internal fixation with bone grafting performed by a single surgeon, and they were followed up for a minimum of 5 years. Some of these patients comprised the malunion group if the height/length ratio (H/L ratio) in the most central longitudinal computed tomographic image was more than 0.6. We compared the clinical outcomes of the malunion group with a well-union group based on various clinical scores (Patient Evaluation Measure, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand, modified Mayo wrist scoring system). Results: The average follow-up period was 81 months (range: 65-110), and 15 cases among the 25 patients were included in the malunion group. There were no statistical differences in the clinical scores between malunions (15 cases) and well unions (10 cases), and there was no correlation between the H/L ratios and the clinical outcomes. Conclusion: The clinical outcomes of malunited scaphoids after reconstruction for scaphoid fractures nonunion did not differ significantly from well-united scaphoids at a minimum 5-year follow-up. Level of evidence: Level IV, prognostic case series. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The objective was hence to assess the clinicoradiological outcomes of DIACFs fixed with an innovative open-envelope MIS technique. Materials and Methods: 42 closed Sanders Type 2 and 3; DIACFs were included in this study. The Open-envelope approach was developed, which is essentially a limited open, dual incision, modified posterior longitudinal approach allowing excellent visualisation and direct fragment manipulation. The main outcome measures were American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) hindfoot score and preoperative and postoperative radiological angles. Results: The Bohler angle improved from a preoperative mean of 14.3 degrees (range 0 degrees-28 degrees) to a postoperative mean of 32.46 degrees (range 22 degrees-42 degrees). The Gissane angle improved from a preoperative mean of 135.83 degrees to a postoperative mean of 128.33 degrees. The postoperative improvement in Bohler and Gissane angles was highly significant (P < 0.001). The AOFAS scores at 6 months were excellent in nine patients, good in 15 patients, and fair in six patients. Three patients had residual valgus deformity of the heel. Conclusions: Open-envelope technique minimized soft tissue complications and achieved acceptable radiological reductions with good clinical outcomes.

Screw-bone interface failure at the uppermost and lowermost vertebrae is not uncommon. Some have advocated for the use of supplement hooks to prevent screw loosening. However, studies describing methods for combined hook and screw systems that fully address the benefits of these systems are lacking. Thus, the choice of which implant to use in a given case is often based solely on a surgeon's experience instead of on the biomechanical features and advantages of each device. Methods: We conducted a biomechanical comparison of devices instrumented with different combinations of hooks and screws. Thirty-six fresh low thoracic porcine spines were assigned to three groups (12 per group) according to the configuration used for of fixation: (1) pedicle screw; (2) lamina hook and (3) combination of pedicle screw and lamina hook. Axial pullout tests backward on transverse plane in the direction normal to the rods were performed using a material testing machine and a specially designed grip with self-aligned function. Results: The pullout force for the pedicle screws group was significantly greater than for the hooks and the combination (p < 0.05). However, no significant difference was found between the hooks and the combination (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Pedicle screws achieve the maximal pullout strength for spinal posterior instrumentation.

CT metal artefact reduction for internal fixation of the proximal humerus: Value of mono-energetic extrapolation from dual-energy and iterative reconstructions	CLINICAL RADIOLOGY			English	Article							PLATE FIXATION; LOCKED PLATE; FRACTURES; DIFFERENTIATION; COMPLICATIONS; MULTICENTER	AIM: To assess the value of dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) and an iterative frequency split-normalized metal artefact reduction (IFS-MAR) algorithm compared to filtered back projections (FBP) from single-energy CT (SECT) for artefact reduction in internally fixated humeral fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six internally fixated cadaveric humeri were examined using SECT and DECT. Data were reconstructed using FBP, IFS-MAR, and mono-energetic DECT extrapolations. Image analysis included radiodensity values and qualitative evaluation of artefacts, image quality, and level of confidence for localizing screw tips. RESULTS: Radiodensity values of streak artefacts were significantly different (p < 0.05) between FBP (-104 +/- 222) and IFS-MAR (73 +/- 122), and between FBP and DECT (32 +/- 151), without differences between IFS-MAR and DECT (p < 0.553). Compared to FBP, qualitative artefacts were significantly reduced using IFS-MAR (p < 0.001) and DECT (p < 0.05), without significant differences between IFS-MAR and DECT (p < 0.219). Image quality significantly (p = 0.016) improved for IFS-MAR and DECT compared to FBP, without significant differences between IFS-MAR and DECT (p < 0.553). The level of confidence for screw tip localization was assessed as best for DECT in all cases. CONCLUSION: Both IFS-MAR in SECT and mono-energetic DECT produce improved image quality and a reduction of metal artefacts. Screw tip positions can be most confidently assessed using DECT.

Materials and Methods: Twenty eyes of 20 patients affected by IEMM underwent 23-Gauge surgery. Morphological and functional examinations were assessed at baseline and at 30, 90, and 180 days after surgery. SD-OCT evaluated foveal morphology and thickness, photoreceptor inner/outer segment junction, and external limiting membrane. Functional assessment evaluated visual acuity, retinal sensitivity, and fixation patterns. Statistical analysis was performed with the Student's t test and Pearson correlation test. Results: Mean central retinal thickness (CRT), visual acuity (VA), and retinal sensitivity (RS) at baseline were respectively 494.90 +/- 38.73 mu m, 0.55 +/- 0.08 LogMAR, and 11.13 +/- 1.02; after surgery, at day 180, we observed a significant decrease in mean CRT to 326.90 +/- 32.68 mu m, an increase in mean VA to 0.33 +/- 0.05 LogMAR (p < 0.05), and in mean RS to 13.25 +/- 0.73 dB (p < 0.05). A stable fixation increased from 40% of patients at baseline to 75% of patients at day 180 (p < 0.05). Discussion: IEMM surgery results in continuous improvement in visual function, not only at month one but also beyond month six, due to the progressive reduction of residual intraretinal edema and recomposition of retinal layers.

Materials and methods: A study was conducted in 26 patients who underwent operative arthroscopic surgery and discopexy using resorbable pins. All patients were refractory to conservative treatment and presented, in at least one joint, anterior disc displacement without reduction on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Pre- and postoperative evaluation parameters were disc position on MRI, maximal interincisal opening, lateral movements, joint pain, and articular locking and clicking. Results: The technique was performed in 34 joints, and 47 pins were inserted. Mouth opening increased significantly, from a mean of 31.24 mm preoperatively to 39.57 mm 1 year postoperatively (p < 0.05). Patients reported a decrease in pain, obtaining values on a visual analogue scale (1-100) of less than 20 after 1 year postsurgery (mean improvement 47.9 points, p < 0.05). Analyzing 1-year MRI findings, in 65% of joints the discs were repositioned and in 20% of joints discs were in a more posterior position. Conclusions: The use of resorbable pins is a useful technique for disc fixation and shows medium-term improvement in clinical parameters and mandibular function. However, further studies are needed to evaluate a longer follow-up, joint morphologic changes, and disc stability on imaging. (C) 2016 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.

A biomechanical comparison of two volar locked plates in a dorsally unstable distal radius fracture model	JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE			English	Article						distal radius fracture; volar locked plate; biomechanical study	INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; INTRAARTICULAR FRACTURES; EXTERNAL FIXATORS; COLLES FRACTURES; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; NEUTRALIZATION; MULTICENTER; SYSTEM; FORCES	Background: This study compares the biomechanical stability of two volar locked plate systems for fixation of unstable, extra-articular distal radius fractures. Methods: In six matched pairs of fresh frozen cadaveric specimens, a simulated unstable, extra-articular distal radius fracture was created. The fractures were stabilized with one of two types of volar locked plates. Specimens were axially loaded at five different positions: central, volar, dorsal, radial, and ulnar. Initial (precyclic loading) stiffness of each locked plate system was calculated. Each specimen was then loaded for 5,000 cycles with an 80 N central load. Finally, specimens were axially loaded at the same five positions to calculate the postcyclic loading stiffness of each volar locked plate system. Main outcome measurements were precyclic loading stiffness, postcyclic loading stiffness, maintenance of stiffness after cyclic loading, and amount of fracture displacement between the two volar locked plate systems. Results: There were no differences in maintenance of stiffness and fracture displacement following cyclical loading between the two volar plate systems. After cyclic loading, the distal volar radius (DVR) locked plate was significantly stiffer than the Synthes volar locked plate in volar loading only (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Materials properties and design differences between these systems did not provide enough biomechanical difference to support use of either implant over the other. With this in vitro model, both implants provided adequate stability to resist physiologic loads expected during therapy in the initial postoperative period.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the involved joint surface area increased with repositioning of the guidewire before screw placement. Materials: Nine matched pairs of cadeveric feet were disarticulated at the tibiotalar joint. Under fluoroscopic guidance, cannulated screws were placed over guidewires after a single pass across the joint for right feet and two passes across the joint for left feet. Specimens were disarticulated through the midfoot, and the digital images of the joint surface were evaluated for joint surface area and the surface area of cartilaginous damage resulting from screw placement. Results: Mean injury area for the first metatarsal (MT1) was 0.106 cm(2) for one pass and 0.168 cm(2) for two passes of the guidewire before screw advancement (p = 0.003) The mean injury area for the second metatarsal (MT2) was 0.123 and 0.178 cm(2) for one and two passes, respectively (p = 0.018). Four of nine (44%) of the left foot specimens (2 passes of the guidewire) sustained fractures across the MT2 base and three or those specimens also revealed fractures on the middle cuneiform side of the joint (33%). Conclusion: Changing the placement of the guidewire across the midfoot significantly increased the joint surface affected by screw placement. Screws placed plantar to the midline of the joint increased the risk of fracture on both sides of the tarsometatarsal complex.

Materials and Methods: The animals were divided into 2 groups: one had surgical treatment for soft tissue repair and the other had no soft tissue treatment. All histologic evaluations were performed according to the presence or absence of synovitis, vascularity, presence or absence of joint inflammation, and presence or absence of the articular disc. The contralateral TMJs also were evaluated. Results: The results showed few histologic changes in the synovial membrane and joint disc for the 2 groups and in the synovial membrane and disc of the contralateral side, where indirect trauma occurred in the unoperated joint. Conclusion: This study showed that treating or not treating soft tissues does not change the treatment results of condyle fracture or interfere with TMJ pathosis.

Our anatomical and biomechanical study focused on use of tension band techniques in patellar fractures. The anatomy of the patella and tendon insertion was examined with knee magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and correlated with the technical requirements of the tension band. Tension band wiring over tendinous tissue was simulated and calculated with a cyclic biomechanical test on cow patellae. According to tension band templating on the MRI section, Kirschner wire insertion was needed for the tension band to turn over the tendinous tissue. The tension band became more stable while turning over less tendinous tissue and more adjacent bone surface. Nevertheless, cyclic loading tests indicate that all tension band applications in this study lose their initial stability. Excessive initial compression by the tension band resulted in bending of the Kirschner wire and thus reduction failure. For optimum stabilisation, tension force transfer should be done directly on bone or at least material that protects the tendon would be useful.

Operative correction of fibular malrotation has not been accurately measured. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of operative correction of fibular malrotation. Materials and Methods: Six pairs of formalin-fixed, lower leg cadaver specimens had shortening with additional internal or external rotation induced by segmental fibular resection and plate fixation. The deformity was measured by CT. Two experienced surgeons performed standardized corrective operations on six specimens each. The postoperative results were measured by CT. Results: The mean overall accuracy for correction of malrotation was 1.58 degrees (SD = 0.8 degrees). There were no significant differences between the two surgeons performing the corrections. Conclusion: The accuracy of operative correction of malrotation in this cadaver model is in accordance with the requirements reported in clinical studies. Clinical Relevance: Considering the error margin for CT analysis, correction within 5 to 10 degrees seems practical.

Mechanical alignment deviation after total knee arthroplasty is a major reason for early loosening of the prosthesis. Achieving optimum cement penetration during fixation of the femoral and tibial component is an essential step in performing a successful total knee arthroplasty. Bone cement is used to solidify the bone and prosthesis. Thickness imbalance of bone cement leads to the deviation of mechanical alignment. To estimate the influence of bone cement, a retrospective study was conducted. Materials and Methods. A total of 36 subjects were studied. All the TKA were performed following the standard surgical protocol for navigated surgery by medial approach with general anaesthesia. Prostheses were fixed by bone cement. Results. We compared the mechanical axis, flexion/extension, and gap balance before and after cementation. All the factors were different compared with those before and after cementation. Internal rotation was reached with statistical significance (p = 0.03). Conclusion. Bone cement can influence the mechanical axis, flexion/extension, and gap balance. It also can prompt us to make a change when poor knee kinematics were detected before cementation.

Plasma processing for inducing bioactivity in stainless steel orthopaedic screws	SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	34th International Conference on Metallurgical Coatings and Thin Films	APR 23-27, 2007	San Diego, CA	Amer Vacuum Soc, Adv Surf Engn Div		plasma processing; orthopaedic screws; bioactive coatings; hydroxyapatite	TITANIUM; BONE	The work presented in this paper is centred on applying plasma processing for inducing bioactivity (ability of a material to bond with bone) in otherwise bioinert stainless steel screws commonly used in orthopaedic surgery. As-received cortical stainless steel screws were hydroxylated using a patented two-step plasma process developed by the authors. The bioactivity of the screws thus processed was investigated in vitro by treating them with simulated body fluid (SBF). The SBF treatment resulted in a thin, continuous surface layer of hydroxyapatite (HA, calcium hydroxy phosphate) on the screws, thus confirming their bioactivity. The plasma processed screws were also compared with wet chemically processed screws for the growth of HA from SBF, and it was found that the HA layer on the plasma processed screws exhibited higher (complete) substrate coverage. The realisation of bioactive screws, in particular fine-threaded stainless steel screws, offers a major advancement towards the fixation of both internal and external orthopaedic implants.

The Mason classification is used to describe the fracture. As of yet, there is no consensus on optimal treatment strategy for Mason II-IV fractures. The aim of this study was to compare the results of conservative treatment with different surgical strategies for radial head fractures. Materials Electronic databases from 1966 to 2004 were screened. Based on our inclusion criteria, 24 studies, describing 825 patients, were included. Results For Mason type II fractures, residual pain was present in 42% of the conservatively treated of the patients compared to 32% of the surgically treated patients. Good/excellent results for Broberg score were 52 and 88%, respectively. For Mason type III and IV fractures, no conservatively treated patients were described. Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to be able to draw definitive conclusions on optimal treatment of type II-IV radial head fractures. Evidence is currently limited to a maximum level II evidence. There is great need for sufficiently powered randomized controlled trials.

Eighteen pairs of fresh human osteoporotic cadaver radii were equally divided into three groups. Each specimen was tested in each of the following force applications: anteroposterior (AP) four point bending, mediolateral (ML) four point bending, and torsion. A 10-mm gap osteotomy model was used to simulate a comminuted diaphyseal radial fracture. For each pair, one radius received a limited contact dynamic compression plate (LC-DCP) and the contralateral radius was fixed with a minimum contact locking plate (MC-LP). Specimens were tested in nondestructive four point bending and torsion on an electronic universal material testing system. The results indicate that the MCLP system is significantly more stable than the LC-DCP system when tested in four point bending and torsion in an osteoporotic comminuted radial diaphyseal fracture model.

Among which, vertebral skeleton model ( including lesion model) printing has been widely used in clinical application due to its relatively simple technology and low cost. It shows practical value and becomes popular as the reference of clinical education, auxiliary diagnosis, communication between doctor and patient, and the planning of surgical approaches as well as the reference of more accurate operation in surgery. On the basis of vertebral skeleton model printing, it can be used to design and make navigation template to guide internal fixation screw, which also obtains some remarkable clinical effects. However, 3D printing technology has a more profound influence on spine surgery. The part with full expectation is undoubtedly the clinical application of 3D printing microporous metal implant and personalized implant as well as the clinical application of 3D printing biological materials in the future.

However, it possesses poor capture ability of CO2 molecule due to the intrinsically weak adsorption, greatly limiting its further PCR improvement. Herein, we modulate the spatial charge redistribution over hierarchically Bi5O7I micro-flower through a facile and cost-efficient iron doping strategy, achieving significantly enhanced CO2 capture capacity. Mechanistic studies indicate that the promoted adsorption ability originates from the localized electrons around the doped Fe sites. Benefiting from the resultant unique electronic structures, the Fe doped Bi5O7I micro-flowers also exhibit remarkably improved harvest of visible light and promoted charge separation and transfer capability, thus finally achieving a notably boosted photocatalytic CO evolution rate of 12.02 mu mol center dot g(-1)center dot h(-1) without any sacrifice agents.

Proximal periarticular locking plates in proximal humeral fractures: functional outcomes	JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY			English	Article						Proximal humeral fracture; locking plates; ASES; DASH	INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; LOCKED PLATE; HEAD ISCHEMIA; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; MULTICENTER; SHOULDER	Background: Some recent studies have asserted that locking plates do not provide adequate fixation of proximal humeral fractures. The purpose of this study is to review our experience with proximal humeral locking plates, including complications, functional outcomes, and predictors of successful treatment. Materials and methods: At our institution, 45 patients (46 shoulders) with displaced proximal humeral fractures were treated with a proximal humeral locking plate over a 6-year period. Patients underwent standard surgical and rehabilitation protocols and were evaluated clinically with Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons standardized outcome measurements and range of motion at last follow-up. Radiographs obtained preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, and at final follow-up were evaluated for fracture type, union, and change in alignment. Results: There were 43 patients (44 shoulders) available for range-of-motion and functional outcome measures with an average follow-up of 34 months. Fracture types included 19 two-part, 21 three-part, 3 four-part, and 1 head-splitting fracture. The mean Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score was 11. The average American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score was 85. The average visual analog pain score was 0.8. The average range of motion was as follows: elevation, 140 degrees; external rotation at side, 49 degrees; external rotation in abduction, 77 degrees; and internal rotation, T11. No patient had evidence of screw cutout, varus collapse, or avascular necrosis. One patient required hardware removal. Conclusions: Displaced proximal humeral fractures can be successfully fixed with locking plates when attention is paid to anatomic reduction, proper plate placement below to the greater tuberosity to allow abduction, screws in the head with subchondral bone purchase, calcar screws from inferior-lateral to superior-medial and delaying shoulder motion until at least 2 weeks. Level of evidence: Level IV, Case Series, Treatment Study. (C) 2011 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

However, some authors have recommended four CCS in diamond configuration in the presence of comminution. However, there are no comparative studies to assess the superiority of one over the other. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare the radiological and functional outcomes of displaced, comminuted, ICNF fracture in young adults managed with three screw inverted triangle versus four screw diamond configuration CCS fixation. Material and Methods Twenty-three patients (group I) with displaced comminuted ICNF fractures were managed with three CCS fixation in inverted triangle fashion between October 2014 and October 2015 and were followed up for a mean duration of 33.5 months (range 25-38 months). Twenty-five patients (group II) with the same inclusion and exclusion criteria were managed with four CCS in diamond configuration between October 2013 and October 2014 and followed up for a mean duration of 33.3 months (range 25-38 months). Radiological outcomes of these patients were compared in terms of union rates and avascular necrosis, while functional outcome was measured by Harris Hip Score (HHS) at a minimum of 24 months. Results Nineteen patients of group I and 20 patients of group II were available for final follow-up. Mean union time in group I was 15 weeks (12-24 weeks), while in group II, it was 14 weeks (12-24 weeks). There was total of four (4/19) cases of non-union in group I, while it was two (2/20) cases in group II. One patient (1/19) developed avascular necrosis in group I, while two (2/20) developed the same in group II. In group I, the mean HHS was 87.3 (range 84-94) points, while in group II, mean HHS was 93.5 (range 78-96) points. Conclusion There is no difference in the clinical and radiological outcomes following three screw inverted triangle or four screw diamond configuration CCS fixation of displaced comminuted ICNF fracture in young adults. Thus, we conclude that both three screw inverted triangle or four screw diamond configuration CCS fixation are effective treatment modalities for fracture neck femur with comminution and in the absence of larger studies and long-term follow-up the superiority of one over the other cannot be recommended.

Trematode embryology: a new method for whole-egg analysis by confocal microscopy	DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Schistosoma mansoni; Echinostoma paraensei; embryo; carmine staining; confocal microscopy		Trematode worms have the neoophoran mode of development in which several specialized vitelline cells surround the zygote. This vitelline cell mass appears just before the zygote passes through the ootype, a thickening of the oviduct, where the egg shell is formed. The great amount of vitelline material blurs the visualization of embryo development in whole egg seen by brightfield microscopy. The eggshell is difficult to cut into thin or ultrathin sections and acts as a barrier to fixation and infiltration with embedding media. The egg shell is also brightly fluorescent when analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. To overcome these technical disadvantages a simple staining protocol widely used in adult helminth morphological analysis was adapted for the study of the embryonic development of two different trematode species. The effects of potassium hydroxide as bleach and ethylene glycol as mounting medium were also evaluated. Confocal microscopy allowed virtual sectioning of whole-mounted eggs and made possible internal morphological detailed analysis of different embryonic stages. This method could contribute to the study of helminth egg embryology.

ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Supracondylar fracture; Blount's method; Sedation; Emergency room	ELBOW FRACTURES; CHILDREN; PHYSICIANS; REDUCTION; OUTCOMES; ANGLE	Background: Studies have established that Blount's method is reliable for treating extension supracondylar fractures (SCFs) in paediatric patients. Reduction in the emergency room (ER) under procedural sedation followed by orthopaedic treatment is increasingly used for many fracture types. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether SCF reduction in the ER was feasible, by determining the failure rate. The secondary objective was to identify causes of failure with the goal of improving patient selection to reduction in the ER. Hypothesis: Gartland II and III SCFs (Lagrange-Rigault grades 2-4) can be treated in the emergency room under fluoroscopic guidance and with procedural sedation. Material and methods: A retrospective study was conducted in 128 paediatric patients who underwent ER reduction of an SCF in 2014-2015. Mean age was 5.6 years. Reduction was performed either by an orthopaedic surgery resident or by a specially trained emergency physician. Results: Of the 128 SCFs, 101 (79%) were Gartland II and 27 Gartland III. In the Lagrange-Rigault classification, 55 (43%) fractures were grade 2, 59 (46%) were grade 3, and 14 (11%) were grade 4. The arm was immobilised using the cuff-and-collar method described by Blount for 4 weeks. All 128 fractures healed without delay. Blount's method alone was effective in 112 (87.5%) patients. Of the 16 other patients, 15 (Lagrange-Rigault 3, n= 14; and 4, n=1) had an unstable fracture after ER reduction and were managed by reduction and internal fixation in the operating room. The remaining patient (0.5%) experienced secondary displacement requiring revision surgery in the operating room. Conclusion: SCFs grades 2 to 4 in the Lagrange-Rigault classification (Gartland II and III) can be treated in the ER by specially trained physicians. Lagrange-Rigault grade 3/Gartland III SCFs are more likely to require subsequent internal fixation but do not contraindicate reduction in the ER. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the outcomes of elderly patients with osteoporotic 2-part PHFs combined with medial column (calcar) instability or disruption who experienced a PHILOS plate plus an allogeneic fibula inserted obliquely. Materials and Methods: One hundred and twelve consecutive elderly patients with severe osteoporotic 2-part PHFs combined with calcar instability or disruption who were treated with a PHILOS plate plus an allogeneic fibula inserted obliquely were retrospectively identified from 3 tertiary medical centres during 2014-2019. The primary outcomes were the Constant scores and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores; secondary outcome was the rate of key orthopaedic complications. Results: Median follow-up was 24 (15.3-27.6) months. Significant improvements in the median Constant scores were observed (39 [26-58 points] prior to surgery vs 81 [67-95 points] at final follow-up). The median ASES scores improved from 43 (26-64 points) prior to surgery to 83 (65-96 points) at final follow-up. The percentage of key orthopaedic complications was 25.6% (22/86). Four (4.7%) cases had loss of reduction, 4 (4.7%) experienced aseptic loosening, 1 (.8%) had non-union, 4 (4.7%) suffered a periprosthetic fracture, 3 (3.5%) experienced a revision surgery, 1 (.8%) had a dislocation and 5 (5.8%) suffered an unbearable shoulder pain. Conclusion: For elderly patients with osteoporotic 2-part PHFs combined with calcar instability or disruption, PHILOS plate combined with an allogeneic fibula inserted obliquely might have recognisable advantages in decreasing the loss of fixation and preventing medial calcar collapse.

However, there are no reports on the three-dimensional postoperative volumetric transformation of the condyle, especially with regard to fragmented cases. Protruding hardware can lead to severe complications, so the goal of this study was to examine the amount of condylar bony resorption occurring after ORIF. Methods: Included were surgically treated CHFs with eligible cone beam computer tomography (CBCT) datasets immediately after ORIF (T1) and after implant removal (T2), plus fractures of the condylar neck and base as a reference. 2D vertical and 3D volume changes of the condylar head after ORIF of CHFs were evaluated by CBCT datasets transformed into 3D models for 3D volumetric assessment using Slicer freeware. Results: Among a total of 50 fractures (38 patients), including 41 CHFs (ORIF with titanium positional screws, including 15 minor and 12 major fragmented cases) plus nine extracapsular fractures (eight upper neck and one base fracture), postoperative condylar volume decreased by a mean of 0.27 cm(3) (median 0.25 cm(3); SD 0.23 cm(3)) or 16% (median 14%; SD 11%). Major fragmented CHFs showed significantly higher resorption rates (p < 0.001, range 8-42%). Age correlated with a decrease in condylar volume (mean 2.4% per 10 years of age, (p = 0.011). No significant correlation could be established between loss of condylar volume and fracture localization. A protrusion of metallic implants was seen in 20% of the assessed cases. Conclusion: Due to substantial volume changes of the condylar head occurring after ORIF, protrusion of implants (both metallic and resorbable) needs to be taken into consideration. An early removal of metallic ostheosyntesis material (around 4 months after ORIF) is strongly recommended to avoid adverse short- and long-term effects.

Materials and Methods: From 1999 to 2008, 229 patients with 312 ICFs were treated in our division. Among them, 195 patients (269 joints) had CT scans for classification. We modified the classification of Neff et al, adding a new fracture type according to our experience: type A, fracture line through lateral third of condylar head with reduction of ramus height; type B, fracture line through middle third of condylar head; type C, fracture line through medial third of condylar head; and type M, comminuted fracture of condylar head. There was no ramus height reduction in fracture types B and C. Our treatment protocol is open reduction for a fracture in which the superolaterally dislocated ramus stump is Out Of the glenoid fossa or any type of fracture with displaced or dislocated fragments that may cause TMJ dysfunction later. Result: Among the 269 joints, 116 had type A fractures (43.1%), 81 had type B fractures (30.1%), 11 had type C fractures (4.1%), and 58 had type M fractures (21.6%); 3 joints (1.1%) had fractures that were not displaced. Of the joints, 173 had open reduction-internal fixation; postoperative CT scans showed that 95.6% of these had absolute anatomic or nearly anatomic reduction. In all of them normal Mouth opening and Occlusion were restored. No or little deviation was found during Mouth opening. Complications were pain in the joint (n = 1), crepitations (n = 2), and facial nerve (temporal branch) paralysis (n 1). Two patients had the plate removed because of these complications. Conclusion: Our new classification based on CT scans can better guide clinical treatment. Open reduction for ICF can restore the anatomic position for both the condyle and TMJ soft tissues with few complications, which can yield better functional and radiologic results.

Primary arthrodesis versus open reduction and internal fixation following intra-articular calcaneal fractures: a weight-bearing CT analysis	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						DIACFS; Three-dimensional; Weight-bearing; Primary arthrodesis; ORIF; Calcaneus fracture; Meary's angle; Calcaneal pitch; Joint space	FOOT; TOMOGRAPHY; SCANS	Purpose To compare primary arthrodesis (PA) versus open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) in displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures (DIACFs), based on clinical outcome and 2D and 3D geometrical analyses obtained from weight-bearing (WB) cone-beam CT images.Materials and methods In this prospective study, 40 patients with surgically treated calcaneal fractures were included, consisting of 20 PA and 20 ORIF patients. Weight-bearing cone-beam CT-images of the left and right hindfoot and forefoot were acquired on a Planmed Verity cone-beam CT-scanner after a minimum of 1-year follow-up. Automated 2D and 3D geometric analyses, i.e., (minimal and average) talo-navicular joint space, calcaneal pitch (CP), and Meary's angle (MA), were obtained for injured and healthy feet. Clinical outcomes were measured using the EQ5D and FFI questionnaires.Results Overall, there were no differences in baseline patient characteristics apart from age (p < 0.005). The calcaneal pitch in 2D after treatment by ORIF (13.8 degrees +/- 5.6) was closer to the uninjured side (18.1 degrees +/- 5.5) compared to PA (10.9 degrees +/- 4.5) (p < 0.001). Meary's angle in 2D was closer to the uninjured side (8.7 degrees +/- 6.3) after surgery in the PA cohort (7.0 degrees +/- 5.8) compared to the ORIF cohort (15.5 degrees +/- 5.9) (p = 0.046). In 3D measurements, CP was significantly decreased for both cohorts after surgery (- 4.09 degrees +/- 6.2) (p = 0.001). MA was not significantly affected overall or between cohorts in 3D. Clinical outcomes were not significantly different between the ORIF and PA cohorts. None of the radiographic measurements in 2D or 3D correlated with any of the clinical outcomes studied.Conclusion Three-dimensional WB CT imaging enables functional 2D and 3D analyses under natural load in patients with complex calcaneal fractures. Based on clinical outcome, both PA and ORIF appear viable treatment options. Clinical correlation with geometrical outcomes remains to be established.	[Baboeram, N. S. V. L.; Sanders, F. R.

Materials and methods: We matched 60 patients (aged 73.2 +/- 6.4 years) with complex PHFs in terms of sex, age, and Charlson Comorbidity Index, who underwent locking-plate open reduction-internal fixation (ORIF) or reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) (2011-2017). Postoperative range of motion and functional outcome were assessed using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons shoulder score, Oxford Shoulder Score, Constant-Murley score, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score at a mean follow-up of 49 months (ORIF group) and 38 months (RSA group). Complications and unplanned revision surgery were recorded, and all radiographs were analyzed. Results: ORIF resulted in numerically, although not statistically significantly, greater mean shoulder motion vs. RSA. Significantly better outcome was reported for the Oxford Shoulder Score (P=034) and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score (P=.026) in the ORIF group, although no significant differences were observed in the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons shoulder score and Constant-Murley score. The complication rate (30% vs. 10%) and revision rate (20% vs. 3%) were significantly higher in the ORIF group (P=.028), with patients who had complications or required revision having worse functional results. Conclusion: Favorable results are achievable through both angular-stable plating and RSA. Although ORIF may be associated with a superior functional outcome, exceeding the minimal clinically important difference, RSA was linked to significantly fewer complications and revisions.

Vancouver classification takes into account fracture location, implant stability and bone stock, but it does not distinguish between fracture patterns. The aim of our work was to study the different fracture patterns of V-B2 PPHF and to analyze if there is any pattern that presents lower osteosynthesis failure rates. Material and methods: All patients with V-B2 PPHF treated by osteosynthesis between January 2009 and January 2019 were included in the study. Using the Gruen system the proximal femur was divided into 3 zones. The lateral zone (Gruen 1 +/- 2 +/- 3), medial zone (Gruen 5 +/- 6 +/- 7), and distal zone (Gruen 4 +/- 3 +/- 5) were analysed and it was determined whether each of the 3 zones was fractured. Results: 56 patients were included in the study. Their mean age was 79 years (R 45 - 92). The chosen treatment was: 39 Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), 10 Stem revision and 7 nonoperatively treatment. In ORIF group, no implant complications (0/24) were found in patients with a single fractured zone, while 5 implant complications (5/15) were discovered in patients with two or more fractured areas; this difference was significant (p=0.0147). All patients treated by stem revision had a fracture that involved two or more zones. In the nonoperatively group, the fracture pattern did not influence the treatment because of all of them had a very precarious functional and medical situation. Conclusions: V-B2 PPHF treated via ORIF affecting only one zone (medial, lateral, or distal) have a lower risk of complication than those affecting two or more zones. We propose a sub-classification of Vancouver B2 type fractures: B2.1 (1 fractured zone) and B2.2 (>= 2 fractured zones). (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Materials and methods: This study included patients (n = 154) treated for proximal humeral fracture by means of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using the Philos (R) plate at a single level I trauma centre between January 2005 and December 2013. Follow-up monitoring included radiographic examination before hospital discharge, and again at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months after surgery. At a minimum follow-up time of 6 months, radiographs taken in the anteroposterior and axial projection were evaluated in regard to the development of humeral head necrosis, non-union, and secondary screw cut out. Results: A total of 154 patients (61 males, 93 females) were available for radiological checkup. Mean age was 55.8 years (range: 19-91 years). There were statistically significant correlations between the development of avascular necrosis (AVN) and fracture type, non-union and smoking, and screw cut out as well as overall complication rate - and age. The time to surgery did not influence the risk for AVN or non-union, independent of fracture type. In this study population, the risk of developing non-union after ORIF was 3.9-fold higher in heavy smokers (i.e., >20 cigarettes per day). The risk for screw cut out was 4.1-fold higher in patients over 60 years of age, and the overall risk for complications was 3.3-fold higher. Conclusion: The older the patient, the more carefully one must consider the decision between conservative and operative treatments. If surgical treatment is performed, screw length should be selected depending on the patient's age. Heavy smokers must be informed preoperatively of the increased risk for bony non-union after ORIF.

Materials and Methods: The technique involved a disc removal, condylar remodeling and fixation of the graft to the fossa-eminence region. Preoperative and 2-years postoperative clinical findings and magnetic resonance features were evaluated in a group of 13 patients (fourteen joints). Results: In this series, a significant decrease of pain level (p < 0.0001) was observed from the first month postoperatively whereas maximal interincisal opening improved significantly (p < 0.05) after three months follow-up. Radiographically, the magnetic resonance imaging two years after surgery showed an increase on the condylar features of sclerosis and flattening. Conclusion: Discectomy and auricular cartilage interposition graft is an acceptable method for cases of temporomandibular joint dysfunction refractory to the arthroscopic treatment but progressive degenerative changes can be observed after this technique. Although this technique is a surgical option for patients with non-reducing displaced TMJ articular discs, the high failure rate indicates that there may be better alternative surgical procedures to consider.

Compound double-plate osteosynthesis has been specifically developed for surgical treatment of these pathological fractures. To our knowledge, this study represents the largest series to date of double-plate compound osteosynthesis with the longest follow-up. Materials and methods Using our institutional digital database, we identified 61 procedures in 53 patients at the proximal femur. Patients were divided into two groups. A 'primary' group with all cases in which a double-plate compound osteosynthesis was performed as initial procedure (n = 46) and a 'revision' group with all cases in which a double-plate compound osteosynthesis was performed as revision procedure after failed previous attempts of internal fixation (n = 15). (1) The survivorship of the hip was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis. (2) Complications were graded using Sink's classification. (3) The functional outcome was quantified with the Merle d'Aubigne and Postel score. (4) Risk factors were identified based on a multivariate Cox-regression analysis. Results The cumulative Kaplan-Meier survivorship of the primary group was 96% at 6 months, 90% at 1 year, 5 years and thereafter and 83% at 6 months, 74% at 1 year, 53% at 2 years for the 'revision' group (p = 0.0008). According to the classification of Sink et al., the rate of grade III and IV complications was significantly lower in the primary group (p < 0.0001). The mean Merle d'Aubigne score was 14 +/- 7 at 0-3 months, 13 +/- 3 at 3-6 months, 15 +/- 3 at 6-12 months and 15 +/- 4 thereafter (p = 0.54). The only multivariate negative predictor was previous surgery with a hazard ratio of 9.2 (p < 0.006). Conclusion Double-plate compound osteosynthesis is a valuable treatment option for pathological fractures in proximal femur with good functional results.

Data regarding quality of the bone after lengthening are needed to consider the time of frame removal and develop a rehabilitation program. Materials and Methods: Computed tomography (CT) assessment of a parent bone was performed on 136 patients with limb length discrepancy and bone deformity of various etiologies before and after lengthening. Transosseous osteosynthesis technique with the Ilizarov's external fixation was used for limb lengthening and deformity correction in all the cases. A 64-slice scanner was used for CT assessments. Specific Roentgen-negative units of the Ilizarov apparatus and techniques for interpreting CT findings were employed for artifact-free densitometric assessment. Results: Cortical density of the femur and tibia in patients with limb length discrepancy and bone deformity of various etiologies was shown to have differences as compared to the contralateral limb. The lengthening process was accompanied by decreased cortical density of the segment being lengthened, and the decrease in the density was greater in the areas adjacent to the distractional bone regeneration. The cortical structure underwent characteristic changes. Osteonal density of the cortical bone was higher in the norm and at long term followup as compared to the density of external and internal plates. Conclusion: Cortical bone of the femur and tibia in patients with limb length discrepancy and bone deformity of various etiologies showed various preoperative local densities of external, internal, and osteon layers. The cortical bone demonstrated heterogenic structures with resorption areas of various magnitude and density, with minimal values at the boundary with regenerate bone during distraction and fixation with frame on and at short-term followup. Complete organotypical restructuring of the bone was shown to occur at a 1-to-3-year followup depending on the etiology of the disease and amount of lengthening performed.

The aim of this study was to compare the stability of parallel and varied divergent lateral pin configurations to provide an easily reproducible technique for optimal pin placement. Methods: Twelve third-generation synthetic composite humeri were osteotomized at the level of the coronoid and olecranon fossae to simulate a humeral supracondylar fracture. Each fracture was reduced and fixed using two 1.6mm (0.062 inches) Kirschner wires (1 fixed, 1 varied) in 4 different positions (from parallel to divergent with respect to fixed wire), and sequentially tested in extension, varus, and valgus as well as internal and external rotations using an MTS 858 Minibionix materials testing load frame (MTS Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN). A 2-way analysis of variance was carried out to compare construct stiffness in all 5 modes of testing according to both pin position and testing sequence. A level of P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The best torsional, valgus, and extension resistances were found with position 4, which was the most divergent configuration. For both internal and external rotations, position 4 showed statistically higher stiffness as compared with all other configurations (P<0.05). In resistance to extension, both positions 3 and 4 were stiffer than either position 1 or 2 (P<0.05). For resistance in varus testing, position 3 showed statistically greater stiffness than all other pin positions (P<0.05). Although there was no statistical difference between all the 4 positions in valgus testing, position 4 showed greater resistance when compared with other positions. Conclusions: The lateral pin placed parallel to the metaphyseal flare of the lateral humeral cortex, in combination with a second diverging pin crossing the fracture site at the medial edge of the coronoid fossa ( position 4), provided the optimum fixation for supracondylar fractures of the humerus. Clinical Relevance: Using these readily available landmarks, the treating surgeon can reproducibly provide appropriate pinning treatment for most of these fractures.

J	Wang, CJ; Liu, HC; Fu, TH				Wang, Ching-Jen; Liu, Hao-Chen; Fu, Te-Hu			The effects of extracorporeal shockwave on acute high-energy long bone fractures of the lower extremity	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						extracorporeal shockwave; acute fracture; long bone; high-energy; lower extremity	WAVE THERAPY; NONUNION; OSTEOPROGENITORS; DIFFERENTIATION; INDUCTION	Introduction High-energy long bone fractures of the lower extremity are at risk of poor fracture healing and high rate of non-union. Extracorporeal shockwave was shown effective to heal non-union of long bone fracture. However, the effect of shockwave on acute fractures is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of shockwave on acute high-energy fractures of the lower extremity. Materials and methods Between January and October 2004, 56 patients with 59 acute high-energy fractures were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomly divided into two groups with 28 patients with 28 fractures in the study group and 28 patients with 31 fractures in the control group. Both groups showed similar age, gender, type of fracture and follow-up time. Patients in the study group received open reduction and internal fixation and shockwave treatment immediately after surgery on odd-numbered days of the week, whereas, patients in the control group received open reduction and internal fixation without shockwave treatment on even-numbered days of the week. Postoperative managements were similarly performed in both groups including crutch walking with non-weight bearing on the affected limb until fracture healing shown on radiographs. The evaluation parameters included clinical assessments of pain score and weight bearing status of the affected leg and serial radiographs at 3, 6 and 12 months. The primary end-point is the rate of non-union at 12 months, and the secondary end point is the rate of fracture healing at 3, 6 and 12 months. Results At 12 months, the rate of non-union was 11% for the study group versus 20% for the control group (P < 0.001). Significantly, better rate of fracture healing was noted in the study group than the control group at 3, 6 and 12 months (P < 0.001). Conclusions Extracorporeal shockwave is effective on promoting fracture healing and decreasing the rate of non-union in acute high-energy fractures of the lower extremity.

We determined whether osteo-conductivity of titanium is stable over time. Rat bone marrow-derived osteoblasts were cultured on new titanium disks (immediately after acid-etching), 3-day-old (stored after acid-etching for 3 days in dark ambient conditions), 2-week-old, and 4-week-old disks. Protein adsorption capacity, and osteoblast migration, attachment, spread, proliferation and mineralization decreased substantially on old titanium surfaces in an age-dependent manner. When the 4-week-old implants were placed into rat femurs, the biomechanical strength of bone-titanium integration was less than half that for newly processed implants at the early healing stage. More than 90% of the new implant surface was covered by newly generated bone compared to 58% for 4-week-old implants. This time-dependent biological degradation was also found for machined and sandblasted titanium surfaces and was associated with progressive accumulation of hydrocarbon on titanium surfaces. The new surface could attract osteoblasts even under a protein-free condition, but its high bioactivity was abrogated by masking the surface with anions. These results uncover an aging-like time-dependent biological degradation of titanium surfaces from bioactive to bioinert. We also suggest possible underlying mechanisms for this biological degradation that provide new insights into how we could inadvertently lose, and conversely, maximize the osteoconductivity of titanium-based implant materials.

Influence of surface modifications on the degradation of standard-sized magnesium plates and healing of mandibular osteotomies in miniature pigs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article						biodegradable osteosynthesis; magnesium alloy; surface modifications; internal fixation; biocompatibility	MARROW STROMAL CELLS; IN-VIVO DEGRADATION; BIODEGRADABLE MAGNESIUM; STRENGTH RETENTION; FLUORIDATED HYDROXYAPATITE; ALLOYS; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; CORROSION; VITRO; BIOCOMPATIBILITY	Biodegradable magnesium alloys are suitable osteosynthesis materials. Despite the alloy composition, surface modifications appear to have an influence on the degradation process and biocompatibility. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of hydrogenation and fluoridation of the surface in a mandibular osteotomy model. Standard-sized plates and screws were implanted in an osteotomy at the mandibular angle in nine miniature pigs. The plates and screws were harvested together with the adjacent tissues at 8 weeks after surgery and were investigated by micro-computed tomography and histological analysis. The bone healing of the osteotomy was undisturbed, independent of the surface properties. The adjacent bone tissue showed new bone formation at the implant surface; however, formation of some lacunae could be observed. The corrosion was between 9.8% and 11.6% (fluoridated < hydrogenated < non-modified) in histological specimens, while radiologically neither the volume nor the density of the osteosynthesis material was reduced in any treatment group. The soft tissues exhibited full biocompatibility with every surface property. In summary, surface modification by hydrogenation and fluoridation did not significantly influence bone healing, biocompatibility, or corrosion kinetics of the magnesium osteosynthesis at the mandibular angle.

Operative Results of Periprosthetic Fractures of The Distal Femur In A Single Academic Unit	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article						Periprosthetic fracture; distal femur; total knee arthroplasty; osteosynthesis; internal fixation; revision total knee arthroplasty	TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY; FEMORAL FRACTURES; FOLLOW-UP; ALLOGRAFTS; PLATE	Background and Aims: Periprosthetic supracondylar fractures after total knee arthroplasty are often associated with poor bone stock, fracture comminution, and loose components. Current operative methods include plating, intramedullary nailing, and re-arthroplasty, depending on the fracture type. The aim of the study was to assess the outcome of operatively treated periprosthetic supracondylar fractures at our institute with special interest on the use of strut grafts in association with plating. Materials and Methods: In all, 68 patients were included in the study. They had been treated operatively due to a periprosthetic supracondylar fracture at our center between 2000 and 2010. The data of these patients were retrospectively collected from the electronic patient archives. Fractures with a fixed prosthesis component were treated using internal fixation provided that there was enough bone for osteosynthesis in the distal fracture fragment (39 patients). Fractures with a loose prosthesis component were treated using re-arthroplasty (29 patients). The demographics of the two treatment groups did not differ statistically significantly. Death or any re-operation was chosen as the endpoint of follow-up. Cumulative survival percentages were estimated for each treatment group. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups regarding clinical outcome. Clinical outcome was not assessable in nine patients. A positive clinical outcome was reported in 52 cases (88.1%). The survival of both laminofixation and re-arthroplasty was 75% at 3 years, but the survival of laminofixated fractures with strut graft was 80% compared to that of 51% without strut grafts. In all, 16 patients (24%) had a post-operative surgical site complication: seven infections (10%), six non-unions (15%), and three patellar dislocations (11%). Conclusions: Post-operative surgical site complications were relatively common in these mainly elderly female patients. The survival percentages of the re-arthroplasty and laminofixation groups were similar. The use of strut grafts in association with plating may decrease re-operation rate.	[Leino, O.

Currently, there are no definitive recommendations for the treatment of fractures at the junction of the dens with the vertebral body of C2 on the basis of outcome and stability data. Depending on patient anatomy, either anterior or posterior approaches can be used to fuse C1 and C2 and to achieve definitive surgical stabilisation. The anterior management of C2 fractures without C1-C2 fusion has the theoretical advantage that it preserves rotational motion at this motion segment and that the anterior approach is associated with lower morbidity. In the study presented here, we followed up a group of our patients who underwent anterior miniplate fixation for C2 fractures. Fifteen patients underwent fixation of C2 fractures with titanium miniplates (Medartis Hand fixation system, 2.0 or 2.3 mm) that were placed using a submental approach. To our knowledge, this construct has not yet been described in the literature. Where necessary, this procedure was combined with screw fixation of the dens as described by Bohler. We retrospectively analysed operative reports and medical records, evaluated the patients' health status using the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36), and performed clinical follow-up examinations. From January 2009 to June 2015, 226 traumatic lesions of the cervical spine were managed at our institution in the inpatient setting. Ninety-two patients underwent conservative treatment. Of the 134 cases that required surgery for fractures and instability, 67 involved the C0-C3 motion segments. In 15 patients, stability was achieved using an anterior miniplate or miniscrews alone (n = 4) or in addition to other techniques (n = 11). Anderson and D'Alonzo type II and III dens fractures with involvement of the body or lateral mass of C2 accounted for eight cases. Effendi type II body fractures with or without instability were seen in four cases. There was no perioperative mortality and morbidity in this patient group. All fractures healed and stability was achieved in all cases. No patient had neurological deficits or required revision surgery. An assessment of postoperative quality of life showed that 11 patients (7 men, 4 women) with a mean age of 57 (+/- 5.3) years reached an SF-36 score that was normal for their age group after a mean period of 33 (+/- 6.3) months following their injury. Compared to a group of healthy subjects, the patients had a range of motion that was limited only at the extremes. In patients with appropriate indications, anterior fixation with miniplates alone or additionally is a further useful treatment option in the management of fractures at the junction of the dens with the vertebral body of C2. Since this type of treatment preserves motion at the C1-C2 motion segment after fracture healing and since an anterior approach is associated with less surgical trauma than posterior instrumentation, the technique presented here should be included in a discussion on (surgical) treatment options.

In this study, the fabrication procedure of biodegradable Zn-0.5Li alloy rib plates is successfully developed, which consists of casting, hot-warm rolling, cutting, and pressing sequentially. Biomechanical three-point bending performance of the Zn al-loy rib plates is comparable to that of commercial pure Ti rib plates, much higher than that of pure Zn rib plates. In addition, the Zn alloy exhibits the best antibacterial ability against E. coli and S. aureus among the three materials. Although the Zn alloy exhibits a weaker MC3T3 cytocompatibility than pure Ti, it is better than pure Zn. This study provides a foundation for the future development of various biodegrad-able Zn alloy rib plates.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The editorial office of Journal of Materials Science & Technology.

The development of new osteosynthesis materials is being driven by the high complication rates following surgical treatment of proximal humerus fractures. Plate osteosyntheses made of steel, titanium and, for several years now, carbon fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFR-PEEK) are used most frequently. Methods: A prospective, randomized study was conducted in order to evaluate whether there are differences in the functional postoperative outcome when comparing CFR-PEEK and titanium implants for surgical treatment of proximal humerus fractures. The primary outcome of shoulder functionality 1 year after surgery was measured with the DASH score, the Oxford Shoulder Score, and the Simple Shoulder Test. Results: Bony consolidation of the respective fracture was confirmed in all the patients included in the study within the scope of postoperative follow-up care. No significant differences in the DASH score, Oxford Shoulder Score, or Simple Shoulder Test were observed 1 year post-operatively when comparing the implant materials CFR-PEEK and titanium. Conclusions: There are no differences in terms of the functional outcome between CFR-PEEK plates and titanium implants 1 year after surgery. Studies on the long-term outcomes using CFR-PEEK plates in osteoporotic bone should be the subject of further research.

The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine whether the use of calcium phosphate bone cement improves clinical and radiographic outcomes and reduces fracture complications as compared with conventional treatment (with or without autogenous bone graft) for the treatment of fractures of the appendicular skeleton in adult patients. Methods: Multiple databases, online registers of randomized controlled trials, and the proceedings of the meetings of major national orthopaedic associations were searched. Published and unpublished randomized controlled trials were included, and data on methodological quality, population, intervention, and outcomes were abstracted in duplicate. Data were pooled across studies, and relative risks for categorical outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes, weighted according to study sample size, were calculated. Heterogeneity across studies was determined, and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: We identified eleven published and three unpublished randomized controlled trials. Of the fourteen studies, six involved distal radial fractures, two involved femoral neck fractures, two involved intertrochanteric femoral fractures, two involved tibial plateau fractures, one involved calcaneal fractures, and one involved multiple types of metaphyseal fractures. All of the studies evaluated the use of calcium phosphate cement for the treatment of metaphyseal fractures occurring primarily through trabecular, cancellous bone. Autogenous bone graft was used in the control group in three studies, and no graft material was used in the remaining studies. Patients managed with calcium phosphate had a significantly lower prevalence of loss of fracture reduction in comparison with patients managed with autograft (relative risk reduction, 68%; 95% confidence interval, 29% to 86%) and had less pain at the fracture site in comparison with controls managed with no graft (relative risk reduction, 56%; 95% confidence interval, 14% to 77%). We were unable to compare pain at the bone-graft donor site between the studies because of methodological reasons. Three studies independently demonstrated improved functional outcomes when the use of calcium phosphate was compared with the use of no grafting material. Conclusions: The use of calcium phosphate bone cement for the treatment of fractures in adult patients is associated with a lower prevalence of pain at the fracture site in comparison with the rate in controls (patients managed with no graft material). Loss of fracture reduction is also decreased in comparison with that in patients managed with autogenous bone graft. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level I.

However, the bone regenerative interaction with the periosteum, the inflammatory response, and the degradation of this material have not been examined. In this study, we used a rat mandible model to compare the above features in u-HA/PLLA/PGA and uncalcined/unsintered HA and poly-l-lactic acid (u-HA/PLLA). We divided 11 male Sprague-Dawley rats into 3- and 16-week groups. In each group, we assessed the characteristics of a u-HA/PLLA/PGA sheet covering the right mandibular angle and a u-HA/PLLA sheet covering the left mandibular angle in three rats each, and one rat was used as a sham control. The remaining three rats in the 16-week group were used for a degradation assessment and received both sheets of material as in the material assessment subgroup. At 3 and 16 weeks after surgery, the rats were sacrificed, and mandible specimens were subjected to micro-computed tomography, histological analysis, and immunohistochemical staining. The results indicated that the interaction between the periosteum and u-HA/PLLA/PGA material produced significantly more new bone regeneration with a lower inflammatory response and a faster resorption rate compared to u-HA/PLLA alone. These findings may indicate that this new biomaterial has ideal potential in treating maxillofacial defects of the midface and orbital regions.

J	Wang, HZ; Zhang, M; Cheng, CK				Wang, Huizhi; Zhang, Min; Cheng, Cheng-Kung			A novel protection liner to improve graft-tunnel interaction following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a finite element analysis	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND RESEARCH			English	Article						ACL reconstruction; Graft wear; Bone tunnel enlargement; Implant; Finite element analysis; Biomechanics; Sports medicine	PATELLAR TENDON; IN-VIVO; ENLARGEMENT; SEMITENDINOSUS; FIXATION; FORCES	BackgroundDeteriorated bone-graft interaction at the tunnel entrance following ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is considered one of the primary causes of long-term tunnel enlargement and graft wear. Methods have been introduced to improve the long-term outcome, such as novel graft materials or alternative fixation methods, but have been met with varying degrees of success. This study aims to design a protection liner to improve the bone-graft interaction at the tunnel entrances.MethodsA finite element model of a human cadaveric knee was used to simulate traditional ACLR and ACLR using the protection liner. Stress distribution around the tunnel entrances and on the ACL graft were calculated under a combined loading of 103 N anterior tibial load, 7.5 Nm internal tibial moment, and 6.9 Nm valgus tibial moment at a joint flexion angle of 20 degrees. Results were compared between the traditional ACLR and ACLR using a double liner (femoral and tibial) setup, as well as between the ACLR using a double liner setup and a single liner (femoral side) setup. Different materials (PEEK, Ti-6Al-4V, CoCrMo) for the liner were also evaluated.ResultsThe traditional ACLR resulted in concentrated stress on the graft where it contacted the tunnel entrance. Correspondingly, there were stress concentrations at the distal posterior zone of the femoral tunnel entrance and medial posterior zone of the tibial tunnel entrance, while the other zones suffered from a stress reduction. Use of the protection liner reduced the stress concentration around the tunnel entrances by up to 89% and increased the stress at the unloaded zones by up to 106%. Also, stress concentration on the graft was slightly decreased (15.4 vs 15.1 MPa) after using the liner. The single liner setup increased the stress concentration around the tibial tunnel entrance. Stiffer materials improved the stress distribution around tunnel entrances but had little effect on the stress on the graft.ConclusionsThe novel protection liner can improve the stress distribution on the graft and at the tunnel entrances, which may be beneficial for improving the clinical outcome of ACLR.

To capture the internal microstructural changes in response to global deformation, the tissue samples were loaded to different strain levels and chemically fixed to permanently preserve the deformed tissue geometry. Tissue microstructural alterations were analyzed to quantify the accumulated damages, with damage-related parameters such as number density, area fraction, mean area, and mean nearest neighbor distance (NND). All three loading states showed a unique pattern of damage evolution, in which the damages were found to increase in number and size, but decrease in NND as strain level increased. To validate the observed damage features as true tissue microstructural damages, more samples were loaded to the above-mentioned strain levels and then unloaded back to their reference state, followed by fixation. The most major damage-relevant features at higher strain levels remained after the release of the external loading, indicating the occurrence of permanent inelastic deformation. This study provides a foundation for future structure-based constitutive material modeling that can capture and predict the stress-state dependent damage evolution in liver tissue.

DHS osteosynthesis with internal bone grafting in unstable delayed presented intracapsular neck femur fractures	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Displaced femoral neck fracture; Osteosynthesis; DHS; Corticocancellous bone grafting	VALGUS INTERTROCHANTERIC OSTEOTOMY; FEMORAL-NECK; RISK-FACTORS; FIBULAR GRAFT; FIXATION; ADULTS; SCREW; METAANALYSIS; NECROSIS; IMPLANT	Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess fracture union and complications following use of dynamic hip screw (DHS) with internal bone grafting in treatment of unstable delayed presented intracapsular neck femur fractures in patients younger than 65 years of age. Material and methods: Thirty two patients with displaced intracapsular neck femur fractures(Garden III and IV, Pauwels III, with comminution) with delayed presentation (15-60 days) in the 45-65 year age group (mean 54.4 +/- 10.2 years) were included in this study. All patients were treated with dynamic sliding hip screw with closed cancellous bone grafting through a tunnel of a triple reamer. The average time to union was 3.8 months (3-5 months). Satisfactory union was achieved in all patients except two. One case developed avascular necrosis of the femoral head. Other complications were coxa vara in two, shortening of less than 10 mm in three cases but there were no cases of infection or implant failure. Excellent results were achieved in 27, good/fair in 4 and poor in 1 patient. Conclusion: Osteosynthesis with DHS and primary cancellous bone grafting in indicated cases is a simple, providing biological stimulation for early union. Failure in a particular case can be treated with any appropriate second procedure. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To expand the knowledge needed in decision making, a patient series is reviewed using health related quality of life (HRQoL), functional and radiographic data from patients treated with percutaneus pinning, locking plates or intramedullary nails. Materials and Methods: Retrospective observational cohort study of patients who underwent internal fixation of fractures of the surgical neck of the humerus between 2004 and 2009 (mean follow-up 40.67 +/- 17.93 months). Fifty patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (mean age 70.04 +/- 13.15 years). Nine had been treated by percutaneous pinning, fifteen with locking plates and twenty-six with intramedullary nails. We compared the results between the three groups of the HRQoL with the EuroQol5D questionnaire; the functional capacity of the operated and non-operated shoulder with the Constant score; and the radiographic result with plain X-rays. Results: Forty-eight patients had achieved fracture healing. The plating and nailing groups had a better fracture reduction compared with the pinning group (p < 0.05). The EuroQol-5D did not discriminate between groups (mean 0.65 +/- 0.26; p > 0.05). The mean Constant score of the K-wire group (47.67 +/- 22.42) was lower than those of the plating (82.45 +/- 17.69) and nailing groups (72.72 +/- 15.96) (p = 0.001), with no differences between plates and nails. There was positive correlation between the EuroQol-5D result and the Constant score (r = 0.490; p < 0.005). The fractured shoulder was worse in each item of the Constant score than the non-operated one in patients treated with pins and nails. Patients treated with plates achieved similar results between operated and non-operated shoulder in three items: arm positioning, internal and external rotation. Seventeen patients (six re-operated) had some kind of complication during follow-up. Conclusion: Patients treated with pinning achieved a worse radiographic and Constant score than patients treated with plates or nails. Although we did not find differences between the plating and nailing groups, patients treated with plates got a Constant score more similar to the non-operated shoulder. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Tanasiewicz, M				Tanasiewicz, Marta			Possibility of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Application in Teaching Preclinical Dentistry - Endodontic and Prosthetic Treatment Prognosis	ADVANCES IN CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Magnetic Resonance Imaging; preclinical dentistry; tooth; endodontic treatment; prosthetic treatment		Background. The necessary condition for successful both endodontic and prosthetic reconstruction treatment is the precise mapping of the shape of dental cavities. The aim of this work is an elaboration and verification of the possibility of using 3D Spin Echo MRI techniques in teaching preclinical dentistry both in endodontic and prosthetics specialty. Objectives. Author' aim was to obtain an elaboration and a verification, whether there exists a possibility to use, at the level of in vitro analysis, techniques of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging, which are based on the 3D sequence of the Spin Echo that may in the future find employment in the teaching of preclinical dentistry, clinical dental therapy and diagnostics within the scope of: a dimensional imaging of the inner topography of teeth and spatial structure of a chamber and root canals of teeth for the therapeutic and didactic aims; introduction of a non-destructive and a non-impressional method of reconstruction of the topography of the inner spaces of the human teeth for the purposes of the reconstructive dentistry. Material and Methods. 6 extracted molar teeth were used for measurements without additional preparation, after endodontic and prosthetic preparation. MR measurements were carried out on a 4.7 T research MRI system equipped with Maran DRX console. Results. Figures show 3D images of outer surface, inner space of the teeth before and after endodontic preparation and internal tooth fixation constructed using both classical methods (polymer mass impression) and non-impressional methods (MRI representation). The sizes of the presented volumes were calculated. Internal tooth volumes were determined before and after endodontic treatment total tooth volumes were also measured. Research proceedings made it possible to compare the quality of internal tooth space after preparation for inner root canals fixations constructed using both classical methods and non-impressional MRI method. Conclusions. The results that has been achieved, indicate at the possibility of employing techniques of the MRI, that are based on the 3D sequence of the Spin Echo as well as on the Single Point Imaging, for the dimensional mapping of the outer topography of teeth as well as a structure of the root canals for the therapeutic and didactical purposes. A numerical model of prepared root canals obtained with the method of the magnetic resonance visualization may constitute in the future a basis for a non-impressional technique of imaging, useful for reconstructive dentistry and for teaching preclinical dentistry in endodontic and prosthetic speciality (Adv Clin Exp Med 2010, 19, 6, 697-707).

Materials and methods: One hundred consecutive cases were included in the study. A case documentation form was used to obtain intraoperative data including age, sex, mechanism of injury, type of fracture according to Association for Osteosynthesis/Association for the Study of Internal Fixation (AO/ASIF) classification and the American Society of Anesthesiologists' (ASA) physical status classification (ASA grade). Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed at the time of admission and at the 6th week; subsequent visits were organized on the 3rd month, 6th month, and 12th month, and in patients with longer - follow-up and annually postoperatively. The Harris score of hip function was used, and any change in the position of the implants and the progress of the fracture union, which was determined radiologically, was noted. Results: The mean age of the patients was 77.66 years (range: 37-98 years), and the sex distribution was 32 males and 68 females. Seventy-three fractures were reduced by closed means, whereas 27 needed limited open reduction. The mean follow-up time for the study group was 31.3 months (range: 12-75 months). Postoperative radiographs showed a near-anatomical fracture reduction in 78% of patients. The Harris hip score was negatively correlated with the ASA score and patient age. No cases of implant failure were observed. Three patients died before discharge (one due to pulmonary embolism, two due to cardiac arrest), and five patients died due to unrelated medical conditions within the first 3 months of the follow-up. Conclusion: Our study showed that proximal femoral nail is a reliable fixation with good fracture union, and it is not associated with major complications in any type of trochanteric femoral fracture.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate various factors that can influence reduction loss, including fracture patterns in unicondylar and bicondylar tibial plateau fractures. Materials and methods: A total of 138 tibial plateau fractures that underwent open reduction and internal fixation using plates were retrospectively reviewed. The OTA/AO classification, fracture pattern, degree of comminution, and existence of reduction loss were evaluated based on simple radiographs and computed tomography. Patient information, including age, gender, and occupation, were acquired through chart reviews. The effect of each variable on reduction loss was evaluated through multiple logistic regression analysis. Results: Of 138 knees, reduction loss was observed in 40 knees (29.0%). Reduction loss was found in 11 (20.4%) of the type B knees (54 knees) and 29 (34.5%) of the type C knees (84 knees), according to the OTA/AO classification. The multiple logistic regression analysis for all cases revealed that the existence of comminution and coronal fracture influenced the occurrence of reduction loss, with odds ratios of 9.148 and 4.823, respectively (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). In type B and type C, according to the OTA/AO classification, the existence of comminution and coronal fracture had causal relationships with the occurrence of reduction loss. The odds ratios of comminution and coronal fracture for reduction loss for type B were 9.114 and 9.117, respectively (P = 0.019 and P = 0.031, respectively), and the odds ratios for type C were 8.490 and 4.782, respectively (P = 0.001 and 0.009, respectively). Conclusions: When a tibial plateau fracture has a coronal fracture, if it is difficult to fix its fragments rigidly with medial or lateral plate fixation; therefore, buttress plating or direct fixation of fragments through the posteromedial, posterolateral, or posterior approach should be considered.

When the medial calcar is disrupted, some patients may have accompanying humeral lesser tuberosity comminution that has not been noticed. To investigate the impacts of comminuted fragments of lesser tuberosity and calcar on postoperative stability, CT results, number of fragments, cortical integrity, and the variation of neck-shaft angle were compared in patients with proximal humeral fractures.Materials and methodsFrom April 2016 to April 2021, this study included patients with senile proximal humeral fractures diagnosed by CT three-dimensional reconstruction with lesser tuberosity fractures and medial column injuries. The number of fragments in the lesser tuberosity and the continuity of medial calcar were evaluated. Postoperative stability and shoulder function were evaluated by comparing changes in neck-shaft angle and the DASH upper extremity function score from 1 week to 1 year after the operation.ResultsA total of 131 patients were included in the study, and the results showed that the number of fragments of the lesser tuberosity was related to the integrity of the medial cortex of the humerus. That is, when there were more than two lesser tuberosity fragments, the integrity of humeral medial calcar was poor. The positive rate of the lift-off test was higher in patients with lesser tuberosity comminutions 1 year after surgery. In addition, patients with more than two lesser tuberosity fragments and continuous destruction of the medial calcar had large variations in the neck-shaft angle, high DASH scores, poor postoperative stability, and poor recovery of shoulder joint function 1 year postoperatively.ConclusionThe number of humeral lesser tuberosity fragments and the integrity of the medial calcar were associated with the collapse of the humeral head and the decrease in shoulder joint stability after the proximal humeral fracture surgery. When the number of lesser tuberosity fragments was greater than two and the medial calcar was damaged, the proximal humeral fracture had poor postoperative stability and poor functional recovery of the shoulder joint, which required auxiliary internal fixation treatment.

Comminuted olecranon fractures: biomechanical testing of locked versus minifragment non-locked plate fixation	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Olecranon fractures; Biomechanical study; Cyclic loading; Locking plates; Non-locking plates	PROXIMAL ULNA; ELBOW; MANAGEMENT; MODEL	Introduction Open reduction and internal fixation has long been accepted as optimal treatment for displaced olecranon fractures based on poor results seen with conservative management. With the presence of comminution, tension-band wiring constructs are contraindicated due to tendency to compress through fragments, thereby shortening the articular segment. Therefore, plate fixation is typically employed. Our hypothesis was that in a comminuted fracture model, 2.7 mm reconstruction plating without locking screws will perform equally to 3.5 mm locked plating in terms of fracture displacement and rotation (shear). Materials and methods A three-part comminuted olecranon fracture pattern was created in nine matched pairs of cadaveric specimen using an oscillating saw in standardized, reproducible fashion. Each matched pair was then randomized to receive either 2.7 mm reconstruction plating or 3.5 mm proximal ulna locked plating. Random allocation software was used to assign the 2.7 mm plate construct to either the right or left side of each pair with the contralateral receiving the 3.5 mm plate construct. Specimens were cyclically loaded simulating passive range of motion exercises commonly performed during rehabilitation. Displacement and rotation in relation to the long axis of the ulna were measured through motion capture. Fragment gapping and rotation was quantified following 100 cycles at 10 N and again following 100 cycles at 500 N. Results No significant differences were detected between the 2.7 and 3.5 mm plates in fracture rotation or gapping following loads at 10 N (0.5 degrees and 0.7 degrees; 0.6 and 1.2 mm; respectively; p > 0.05) or 500 N (2.3 degrees and 1.6 degrees; 3.8 and 3.1 mm; respectively; p > 0.05) loading. Fragment rotation and gapping were positively correlated within each plate construct (R-2 > 0.445; p < 0.05). Conclusions 2.7 mm plating is an alternative to 3.5 mm locked plating with decreased plate prominence without significantly sacrificing displacement and rotational control. This is beneficial in fracture patterns where the traditional dorsal plating does not offer optimal screw trajectory.

Gary			Locked versus standard unlocked plating of the symphysis pubis in a Type-C pelvic injury: A cadaver biomechanical study	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Symphyseal locked plating; Locked plating; Fixation failure	INTERNAL-FIXATION; FRACTURES; STABILITY; MOBILITY; FAILURE; DESIGNS; 2-HOLE; RING	Introduction: The benefits of locked plating for pubic symphyseal disruption have not been established. The purpose of this biomechanical study was to determine whether locked plating offers any advantage over conventional unlocked plating of the pubic symphysis in the vertically unstable, Type-C pelvic injury. Methods: In each of eight embalmed cadaver pelvis specimens, sectioning of the pubic symphysis in conjunction with a unilateral release of the sacroiliac, sacrospinous, and sacrotuberous ligaments and pelvic floor was performed to simulate a vertically unstable Type-C (Orthopaedic Trauma Association 61-C1.2) pelvic injury. The disrupted SI joint was then reduced and fixed using two 6.5 mm cannulated screws inserted into the S1 body. Using a six-hole 3.5 mm plate specifically designed for the symphysis pubis having both locked and unlocked capability, four pelvises were fixed with locked screws and four pelvises were fixed with standard unlocked bicortical screws. Both groups were similar based on a dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry evaluation (P = 0.69). Each pelvis was then mounted on a servohydraulic materials-testing apparatus using a bilateral stance model to mainly stress the symphyseal fixation and was cycled up to 1 million cycles or failure, whichever occurred first. Results: Five specimens experienced failure at the jig mounting/S1 vertebral body interface, occurring between 360,000 and 715,000 cycles. Frank failure of the anterior or posterior instrumentation did not occur. However, end-trialing diastasis of the initial pubic symphysis reduction was found in all pelvises. There were no differences between the groups with respect to this loss of symphyseal reduction (P = 0.69) or average cycles to failure (P = 1.0). Conclusion: Pubic symphyseal locked plating does not appear to offer any advantage over standard unlocked plating for a Type-C (OTA 61-C1.2) pelvic ring injury. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Terrible triad injury of the elbow: How to improve outcomes?	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Elbow dislocation; Radial head; Coronoid process; Joint instability	RADIAL-HEAD; COMPLEX INSTABILITY; FRACTURES; MANAGEMENT; DISLOCATIONS; PROSTHESIS; SERIES	Introduction: Dislocation of the elbow joint combined with fractures of the radial head and ulnar coronoid process is referred to as Terrible Triad Injury (TTI). The purpose of this study is to report our experience in the management of this specific injury and to validate the therapeutic choices of our treatment. Material and methods: Between 1996 and 2006, 23 TTI in 22 patients were treated in our department. Fifteen males and seven females of mean age 46 years were included in this series. Internal fixation of the radial head was performed in 13 cases and arthroplasty in four. Fractures of the coronoid process were managed by surgical fixation in 10 cases. All torn ligaments were reconstructed which include 19 lateral and six medial ligament reconstructions. Results: Thirteen patients (14 elbows) were reviewed at a mean follow-up of 63 months, four patients at a mean follow-up of 11 month (range, 6 to 18 months), and five patients were lost to follow-up. All patients had stable elbow joint and in 90% of the cases, patients reported mild or no elbow pain. The arc of extension-flexion ranged from 18 to 127., while the average arc of pronation-supination was 134 degrees. The mean Mayo Elbow Performance Score was 87. Only one patient suffered from osteoarthritis 8 years after trauma and all elbows were centred on X-rays. Negative prognosis factor was associated with Mason type 3 radial head fractures. Discussion and conclusion: The principle of the surgical management is based on two main objectives: restoration of bony stabilizing structures (radial head and coronoid process) and lateral collateral ligament reconstruction. A medial surgical approach is recommended in the case of persistent posterolateral instability following lateral collateral ligament reconstruction or when fixation of a large coronoid process fragment is indicated. The use of an external fixator is only advocated in case of persistent instability following the reconstruction of bony and ligamentous structures. Level of evidence: Level IV: Retrospective study.

However, no randomized controlled studies have compared the efficacy of the two approaches-the Wiltse's paraspinal approach and open book laminectomy in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures with greenstick lamina fractures. Materials and methods: Patients with burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine without neurological deficit were randomized to receive either the Wiltse's paraspinal approach (group A, 24 patients) or open book laminectomy (group B, 23 patients). Patients were followed postoperatively for average of 27.4 months. Clinical and radiographic data of the two approaches were collected and compared. Results: Our results showed the anterior segmental height, kyphotic angle, visual analog scale (VAS) score, and Smiley-Webster Scale (SWS) score significantly improved postoperatively in both groups, indicating that both the Wiltse's paraspinal approach and open book laminectomy can effectively treat thoracolumbar burst fractures with greenstick lamina fractures. The Wiltse's paraspinal approach was found to have significantly shorter operating time, less blood loss, and shorter length of hospital stay compared to open book laminectomy. However, there were two (2/24) patients in group A that had neurological deficits postoperatively and required a second exploratory operation. Dural tears and/or cauda equina entrapment were subsequently found in four patients in group B and all two patients of neurological deficits in group A during operation. No screw loosening, plate breakage, or other internal fixation failures were found at final follow-up. Conclusions: The results demonstrated that either of the two surgical approaches can achieve satisfactory results in treating thoracolumbar burst fractures in patients with greenstick lamina fractures. However, if there is any clinical or radiographic suspicion of a dural tear and/or cauda equina entrapment pre-operation, patients should receive an open book laminectomy to avoid a second exploratory operation. More research is still needed to optimize clinical decision-making regarding surgical approach.

Operative treatment of clavicle midshaft fractures using a locking compression plate: Comparison between mini-invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPPO) technique and conventional open reduction	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Clavicle midshaft fractures; Locking compression plate; MIPPO; Conventional open reduction; Operative treatment; ORIF	MIDCLAVICULAR FRACTURES; FIXATION; NONUNION; SHOULDER	Hypothesis: The goal of the present study was to compare minimally invasive percutaneous plate osteosynthesis (MIPPO) technique and conventional open reduction with LCP for the treatment of clavicle midshaft fractures in adults in a randomized, controlled, clinical trial with a minimum of 1-year follow-up. Materials and methods: Between June 2006 and May 2008, 64 cases of open reduction and internal plate fixation were performed for clavicle midshaft fractures. The operative indications were complete displacement, severe comminution and marked shortening of the clavicle (> 2 cm). MIPPO and conventional open reduction surgery procedures with LCP were used in 32 and 32 cases, respectively. Results: The mean time to union was 13 weeks in the open reduction group compared to 12 weeks in MIPPO group (P > 0.05). The MIPPO group had no significantly superior Constant shoulder scores or DASH scores at all time-points (P > 0.05). However, the complications in the open reduction group were dysesthesia in the area of the incision and directly below in 10 cases, hypertrophic scarring in five cases, painful shoulder in two cases and a limitation of shoulder motion in one case (P > 0.05). The complications in the MIPPO group were dysesthesia in two cases, no hypertrophic scarring, no painful shoulder, no limitation of shoulder motion were noted (P < 0.05). Patients in this operative group were more satisfied with cosmetic appearance and overall outcome than those in the conventional open reduction group. Conclusions: Operative treatment with a LCP for clavicle shaft fractures can be used to obtain stable fixation. Particularly, MIPPO of displaced midshaft clavicular fractures resulted in a lower rate of dysesthesia, hypertrophic scarring, and a better cosmetic than conventional open reduction, although the functional outcomes (Constant and DASH) were no different between the two groups. Overall satisfaction was higher in the MIPPO group than conventional open reduction group. Level of evidence: Level IV. Retrospective study. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

It is used in dentistry, hospital incubators, lenses, and various surgical fields, especially ortho-pedics. In this preliminary study, we aimed to prepare cadavers using the industrial form of polymethyl methacrylate.Methods: The new technique consists of fixation, washing, purification, impregnation, and polymerization. For the study, two whole rat bodies, two rat front legs and two rat hind legs, one half rat body, two whole mouse bodies, and all internal organs were used. Wistar albino rats and BALB/c mice were used. After the cadaver samples were fixed and washed, they were passed through an alcohol series starting from 50%, completing the purification process. In the next step, a solution was prepared by mixing 100 ml of Thinner into 1000 ml of a mixture containing styrene, methyl methacrylate, and Co(II)2-ethyl hexanoate. The samples were immersed in the solution under negative pressure (from 10 mmHg to 400 mmHg), allowing the samples to absorb the solution thoroughly. They were then treated with methyl ethyl ketone peroxide and the polymerization step was terminated.Results: The cadaver samples obtained using polymer were hard, they maintained the given shape, and showed a relatively transparent quality. The production of these materials took 35 days, excluding fixation. The tissue samples were odorless in the process after polymerization. Also, there was no decay in the samples after the production stage and they could be stored under room conditions.Conclusion: This study determined that cadavers could be prepared using polymethyl methacrylate and methyl ethyl ketone peroxide. The polymer used here cost about $5. The cadavers can be safely exhibited in room conditions for five years without requiring special conditions like pools or cold storage. Further re-search should compare this technique with the plastination technique in terms of texture, color, weight, application time, and cost.(c) 2022 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Although significant progresses in surgical technique have been made, anatomical reconstruction of radio-carpal articular surface still represent a difficult task, especially in multifragmentary fractures. Available PEEK reinforced-carbon fiber composite radiolucent devices allow both an easier and more careful assessment of intra-operative reduction of the articular surface of distal radius and prompt correction of any residual step deformity. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed clinical and radiological multicentre results of 71 consecutive AO B and C fracture pattern of distal radius treated using the same PEEK reinforced-carbon fiber composite radiolucent plate. Results: Three patients lost at final follow up and 4 cases with incomplete radiological documentations were excluded from the study. 64 patients (38 females, 26 males) were available and formed the basis of this report. Fracture types included 9 patients with 23-B, 13 patients 23-B2, 15 patients with 23-B3, 10 patients with 23-C1, 7 patients with 23-C2 and 10 patients with 23-C3. Mean Modified Mayo wrist Score was on average 38.11 (SD 10.1; range 24-75, 95% CI 34.7-41.4), 67.22 (SD 9.6, range 50-90, 95% CI 64-70.4), 90.54 (SD 6.3, range 75-100, 95% CI 88.4-92.6) at one, two and twelve months of follow-up, respectively. A statistically significant difference was found between mean scores at different follow-up periods (p = 0.001). We noted 1 case of distal screw fixation aseptic loosening at 5 months post surgical intervention. Conclusions: PEEK reinforced-carbon fiber composite radiolucent plate represents a useful device for treatment of complex distal radius fractures in the adult population. It possesses unique biomechanical properties and allows for an easier anatomical reduction during surgical intervention. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is generally accepted that displaced subcondylar fractures are indicated for open reduction, but the proper treatment of condylar head fractures are still variable. This retrospective study compares the radiographical and functional outcomes of bilateral condylar head fractures between open and closed reduction groups. Materials and Methods From February 1994 to June 2012, a total of 85 patients with bilateral condylar head fractures were retrospectively reviewed. Among this group, 41 cases underwent open reductions while the other 44 cases had closed reductions. Only adult patients with adequate follow-up and complete radiographic study were included in this study: consisting of 20 patients in the open group and 18 patients in the closed group. The subjective symptoms including temporomandibular joints (TMJ) symptoms, complications or adverse sequelae, and functional results, such as maximal mouth opening, were recorded. The outcome of patient's satisfaction was individually assessed by an independent reviewer. The computed tomographic results after treatment were evaluated between both groups. Results The mean follow-up period was 25.5 13.3 months. The open reduction group had better postoperative chewing functions, less malocclusion rates, less degree of TMJ pain (p = 0.046), better radiographic outcome (p = 0.036), and an overall satisfaction rate (p = 0.039). There were 4 cases of failure in the closed reduction group. Subsequent open reduction (n = 2) and redo closed reduction with intermaxillary fixation (n = 2) were performed. Eleven patients in the close reduction group presented persistent malocclusion through objective evaluation. The subsequent treatment included further orthognathic surgery (n = 1) and orthodontic treatment (n = 7). Three of the patients refused further treatment. Conclusions Open reduction for bilateral condylar head fractures presented an overall better functional and radiographic outcome, with higher patient satisfaction if condylar fracture segments were still feasible for rigid fixation.

Many surgeons use cerclage sutures for tuberosity fixation in reverse total shoulder arthroplasty for proximal humeral fractures. In this study, we hypothesized that sutures fixated with a tensioning device would achieve higher initial fixation stability of the tuberosities compared with manually knotted cerclage sutures in a biomechanical model. Methods: A 4-part fracture was created in 7-paired human cadaver proximal humeri. The tuberosities were reduced anatomically and fixed with 3 cerclage sutures in a standardized technique. Tightening was performed either manually (n = 7) or with a cerclage tensioning device with 50 Newton meter (N m) (n=7). The humeri were placed in a custom-made test setup enabling internal and external rotation. Cyclic loading with gradually increasing load was applied with a material testing machine starting with 20 N m and increasing by 5 N rn after each 100th cycle until failure (>15 degrees rotation of the tuberosities). Motion of the tuberosities was measured with a 3-dimensional camera system. Results: Overall, the knot group reached 1040 +/- 152 cycles, and the device group reached 1820 +/- 719 cycles (P = .035). Major fragment motion was detected in the humeral shaft axis and in the distal divergence of the tuberosities. After 900 cycles, the knot group showed increased rotation of both lesser and greater tuberosities in all 3 axes around the humeral shaft compared with the device group. Conclusion: Biomechanical stability of the reattached tuberosities is significantly increased, and rotational movement of the tuberosities is decreased after tightening of the applied cerclage sutures with a tensioning device compared with manual knotting. However, transferability of these promising biomechanical results and their clinical relevance have to be verified with clinical studies.

J	Singh, J; Jain, K; Mruthyunjaya; Ravishankar, R				Singh, Jaswinder; Jain, Karun; Mruthyunjaya; Ravishankar, R.			Outcome of closed proximal phalangeal fractures of the hand	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Proximal phalanx fracture; hand; closed reduction; open reduction	FIXATION; METACARPAL	Background: The proximal phalanx (PP) of the fingers is fractured more frequently than the middle or even distal phalanges. The problems of malunion, stiffness and sometimes loss of skin or other soft tissues associated with PP fracture increases the disability. The optimum treatment depends on fracture location, fracture geometry and fracture stability. The objective of the study was to analyse the treatment outcome in a series of closed proximal phalangeal fractures of the hand. Materials and Methods: Eighty-four proximal phalangeal fractures in 68 patients were enrolled from 2007 to 2009. The treatment modalities were broadly categorised into two groups, Group A consisted of conservative treatment, and Group B consisted of surgical treatment. Group A included 47 digits treated with closed reduction (CR) with immobilization (n=43), extension block cast and dynamic traction (n=4), while 37 digits were treated in Group B, which included closed or open reduction (OR) and internal fixation (IF) with K-wires (n=31), OR and IF with stainless-steel wiring (n=2), and mini external-fixator (n=4). Belsky's criteria and Gingrass' criteria were used for assessment of finger injuries and to assess the efficacy of conservative and surgical modalities for closed proximal phalangeal fractures of the hand. Results: Average period of follow-up was 1 year (range 10-14 months). The excellent to good results seen in Groups A and B were 89% and 92%, respectively. Six complications were seen in Group A, which included four cases with malunion and two cases with digital stiffness. Three complications were seen in Group B, which included one each of malunion, digital stiffness and extensor lag. Overall, maximum poor results (n=4) were seen with CR and buddy strapping. Conclusion: Conservative treatment is an inexpensive method, particularly suitable for stable fractures, and in patients who are poor candidates for surgery, Surgical modalities have distinct advantage of stable fixation, but with added risk of digital stiffness. Percutaneous pinning is a reliable, most commonly used surgical modality and technically easier. Both conservative and surgical modalities have good efficacy when used judiciously.

A new augmentation technique of plated complex PHFs with metaphyseal defects was recently introduced in the clinical practice. This biomechanical study aimed to analyze the stability of plated unstable PHFs augmented via implementation of this technique versus no augmentation. Materials and Methods: Three-part AO/OTA 11-B1.1 unstable PHFs with metaphyseal defects were created in sixteen paired human cadaveric humeri (average donor age 76 years, range 66-92 years), pairwise assigned to two groups for locked plate fixation with identical implant configuration. In one of the groups, six-milliliter polymethylmethacrylate bone cement with medium viscosity (seven minutes after mixing) was placed manually through the lateral window in the defect of the humerus head after its anatomical reduction to the shaft and prior to the anatomical reduction of the greater tuberosity fragment. All specimens were tested biomechanically in a 25 & DEG; adduction, applying progressively increasing cyclic loading at 2 Hz until failure. Interfragmentary movements were monitored by motion tracking and X-ray imaging. Results: Initial stiffness was not significantly different between the groups, p = 0.467. Varus deformation of the humerus head fragment, fracture displacement at the medial humerus head aspect, and proximal screw migration and cut-out were significantly smaller in the augmented group after 2000, 4000, 6000, 8000 and 10,000 cycles, p & LE; 0.019. Cycles to 5 & DEG; varus deformation of the humerus head fragment-set as a clinically relevant failure criterion-and failure load were significantly higher in the augmented group, p = 0.018. Conclusions: From a biomechanical standpoint, augmentation with polymethylmethacrylate bone cement placed in the metaphyseal humerus head defect of plated unstable PHFs considerably enhances fixation stability and can reduce the risk of postoperative complications.

J	Jennison, T; Yarlagadda, R				Jennison, Toby; Yarlagadda, Rathan			Outcome of surgical treatment of inter prosthetic fractures: A case series	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Interprost hetic fracture; Union; Revision arthroplasty	FEMORAL FRACTURES; CLASSIFICATION-SYSTEM; VALIDATION; MANAGEMENT	Introduction: Interprosthetic fractures occur between a total knee replacement and a femoral stem of either a hemiarthroplasty or total hip replacement. The number of interprosthetic fractures will increase as the number of joint replacements rises. There is currently a paucity of literature looking at the outcomes of interprosthetic fractures. Therefore, we performed a retrospective study to: (1) determine fracture union in patients following surgical treatment of a femoral interprosthetic fracture, (2) measure outcomes included mortality and complications. Hypothesis: Favoring bone fixation instead of prosthetic revision gives an acceptable rate of reoperation. Materials and methods: A retrospective case note review of all interprosthetic femoral fractures admitted to a tertiary trauma centre over a 7-year period. There were 24 patients (4 males and 20 females) with a mean age of 82.3 (65-98). The initial operative procedure was a total hip replacement (THR) and a total knee replacement (TKR) in 19 patients, one THR and revision TKR, four hip hemiarthroplasty and TKR. There were 23 cemented femoral stems, and 1 uncemented femoral stem. The median time to surgery was 84 hours. The median length of hospital stay was 16 days. Nineteen patients underwent open reduction internal fixation and 1 of these used a strut graft. Two patients underwent revision knee replacements and 3 underwent a revision hip replacement. All patients had at least 2 years clinical follow-up. Results: One patient died within 30 days of fracture, leaving 23 patients to assess bone union. Another patient died within 1 year of fracture. Three out of 24 patients (12.5%) suffered a complication that required further surgery. The fracture united in 19/23 (82.6%) of patients and the 2-year mortality rate was 5/24 (20.8%). Discussion: Interprosthetic fractures are complex fractures occurring in elderly patients with multiple medical comorbidities. Whenever possible bone fixation instead of prostehtic revision give a low rate of complication and reoperation. The surgical treatments are complex, but with a well-performed surgical technique and an adequate rehabilitation program can result in satisfactory outcomes.

The computer-assisted preoperative planning has great potential, but there are no preoperative plans to determine appropriate fixation methods for distal femoral fractures on an individual basis. The aims of this study are: (1) to describe the technique of finite element analysis combined with computer-assisted preoperative planning to determine a fixation method for distal femoral fractures and (2) to evaluate the intra-operative realization of this technology and the clinical outcomes based on it for distal femoral fractures. Materials and MethodsBetween January 2017 and January 2020, 31 patients with distal femoral fractures treated by open reduction and internal fixation were included and randomly divided into two groups based on preoperative planning methods: conventional group (n = 15) and computer-assisted group (n = 16). Firstly, how to determine the most appropriate plate and screw length and placement in the preoperative planning of distal femoral fractures was described. The time taken for preoperative planning for different fracture types in the computer-assisted group was then analyzed. Finally, intraoperative and postoperative parameters were compared between the conventional and computer-assisted groups, assessing operative time, intraoperative blood loss, number of intraoperative fluoroscopies, days of hospital stay, Visual Analog Scale for Pain Score (VAS), and Knee Society Score (KSS). ResultsMean total planning time for 33-A, 33-B, and 33-C fractures in computer-assisted group were 194.8 +/- 6.49, 163.71 +/- 9.22, and 237 +/- 5.33 min, respectively. Compared with the conventional group, the patients in the computer-assisted group had less blood loss, fewer fluoroscopic images, and shorter operation time (p < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the hospitalization days, KSS score and VAS score between the two groups (p > 0.05). ConclusionsThe results of this study show that finite element combined with computer-assisted preoperative planning can effectively help surgeons to make accurate and clinically relevant preoperative planning for distal femoral fractures, especially in the selection of appropriate plate length and screw positioning.

Materials and methods: Medical records of 99 adult patients who had operative treatment for a proximal femoral fracture with a fracture of the lateral femoral wall between May 2004 and April 2015 were retrospectively analysed to determine factors associated with implant failure. Patients underwent routine surgical procedures for implantation of extramedullary or intramedullary devices. Potential predictors were age, gender, body mass index, comorbidities, type of fracture, reduction method, status of greater and lesser trochanters, course of the lateral fracture line, and presence/absence of a free bone fragment at the junction of the greater trochanter and lateral femoral wall. Results: Ten (10%) implant failures were identified. Univariate analysis identified a free bone fragment at the junction of the greater trochanter and lateral femoral wall (odds ratio [OR], 21.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.31-104.67; p < 0.001) and a transverse fracture line across the lateral femoral wall (primary or iatrogenic) (OR, 5.36; 95% CI, 1.29-22.30; p = 0.021) as factors associated with implant failure. Using a multivariate model, only a free bone fragment at the junction of the greater trochanter and lateral femoral wall (OR, 16.05; 95% CI, 3.06-84.23; p = 0.001) was a risk factor for implant failure. Conclusions: A free bone fragment at the junction of the greater trochanter and lateral femoral wall and a transverse fracture line across the lateral femoral wall are predictors of implant failure in proximal femoral fractures with a fracture of the lateral femoral wall. Integrity of the lateral femoral wall correlates with prognosis of proximal femoral fracture. Lateral femoral wall reconstruction may be required for effective treatment of proximal femoral fractures with a fracture of the lateral femoral wall. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							NONSURGICAL TREATMENT; MANDIBULAR CONDYLE; FOLLOW-UP; CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT; SUBCONDYLAR FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; GROWTH	Purpose: This study measured the mandibular ramal height in patients with unilateral condylar fractures managed by the closed method using elastic intermaxillary fixation. Its correlation with facial asymmetry and condylar displacement was assessed. This will determine whether the treatment outcome is in favor of the closed or open method. Materials and Methods: A prospective cohort study was performed. The study included patients with unilateral condylar fractures who reported to SDM Craniofacial Surgery and Research Centre, Dharwad, India. All patients in the study were managed by the closed method (nonsurgically using arch bars and elastic intermaxillary fixation). Standardized panoramic radiographs were used to assess ramal height and condylar displacement in the sagittal plane. Posteroanterior mandible and reverse Towne radiographs were used to assess facial asymmetry and condylar displacement in the coronal plane before treatment; immediately after treatment; and at 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up. Data were subjected to statistical analysis using the analysis-of-variance test and the Pearson correlation coefficient method. Results: The study included 25 patients with unilateral condylar fractures managed by closed treatment; they showed a significant reduction in ramal height on the affected side by 1.15 mm (P = .0001) at 12 months' follow-up. The change in facial asymmetry was reported as 1.05 mm (P = .0016) at 12 months' follow-up. Its correlation with ramal height was noted to be insignificant (P = .07). The only significant correlation noted between facial asymmetry and condylar displacement was in the coronal plane at 12 months' follow-up (P = .04). Conclusions: A weak positive correlation was noted among the assessed values on radiographs obtained during the 12-month follow-up. Facial symmetry was not greatly affected when the ramal height at the time of injury on the fractured side was reduced by 3.25 +/- 0.6 mm.

Sacral Dysmorphism and its Implication on the Size of the Sacroiliac Joint Surface	CLINICAL SPINE SURGERY			English	Article						sacral anatomy; sacral dysmorphism; residual sacral disk space; computed tomography; sacroiliac joint surface; iliosacral screw positioning	ILIOSACRAL SCREW FIXATION; POSTERIOR PELVIC RING; INTERNAL-FIXATION; QUANTIFICATION	Study Design: This is a retrospective data analysis. Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence of sacral dysmorphism and its correlation to the size of the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) surface based on computed tomography (CT) scans. Summary of Background Data: Sacroiliac screw fixation is a widely accepted technique for stabilization of posterior pelvic ring injuries. Safe sacral screw placement may be impaired by sacral dysmorphism. The prevalence and impact of sacral dysmorphism on the size of the SIJ surface is unknown. Materials and Methods: In total, 269 CT scans were evaluated for the presence of the 5 signs of sacral dysmorphism (mammillary bodies, tongue-in-groove, residual upper sacral disk space, colinearity, and dysmorphic sacral neural foramina). The size of the SIJ surface was calculated by measuring the sacral joint line of the SIJ on each axial CT slice. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to reveal sex-related or age-related differences and correlations between the presence of the dysmorphic signs and the size of the SIJ surface. Results: Prevalence rates of the dysmorphic signs ranged from 5% (colinearity) to 70% (residual sacral disk space). Only 15% did not show any sign of sacral dysmorphism. The average size of the SIJ surface was 7.36 cm(2); it was significantly larger in male (8.46 cm(2)) than in female (6.11 cm(2)) patients (P<0.001). The presence of tongue-in-groove morphology was associated with a significantly larger SIJ surface (P<0.001), the presence of a residual upper sacral disk space with a significantly smaller joint surface (P=0.006). Conclusions: The prevalence of sacral dysmorphism is remarkably high in a normal population and it is questionable if the respective signs should be called dysmorphic after all. The possibility of a smaller joint surface in female patients and patients with a residual upper sacral disk space should be considered in the planning of iliosacral screw placement.

Method: A prospective clinical and radiological study was carried out over a 41-month period. All adult patients suffering from a displaced LSCF or HSCF who consented to the surgical treatment were included in the study. All fractures were operated on using an HSMA and were stabilised using a 4- or 9-hole TCP(R) plate. No intermaxillary fixation was used and a soft diet was started on the 1st postoperative day. Clinical examinations and control X-rays were carried out on the 10th postoperative day, in the 1st, the 3rd and, at least, in the 6th postoperative months. Material: Sixty-four patients (12 females, 52 males mean age: 28.3) with a total of 75 fractures (54 LSCF, 21 HSCF) were included in the study. Mean postoperative follow-up was 14 months. Results: In the 6th postoperative month, all fractures were consolidated in 79% of the cases in an anatomical position. A secondary displacement of the fracture occurred in 6.6% of the cases. Plate fracture was not observed. Dental occlusion remained unchanged in 94% of the patients. The mandibular movements (mouth opening, protrusion, lateral movements on the unfractured and fractured side) had normal mean values (49.5, 10.4, 12.8, 12.1 mm, respectively). These movements were symmetrical in 95% of the patients. No patient complained about articular pain or noise. No facial nerve palsy was noticed, not even a transiently one. All patients but one found the scars acceptable. Conclusion: TCP(R) plates, in association with HSMA, were found to be an efficient osteosynthesis device for stabilising subcondylar fractures.

J	Jackson, ND; Nyska, A; Palmanovich, E; Nyska, M				Jackson, Nicolette D.; Nyska, Abraham; Palmanovich, Ezequiel; Nyska, Meir			The biointegration profile of fiber-reinforced plates following tibial implantation in sheep	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH			English	Article						bioabsorption; biocompatibility; biointegrative; M2 macrophages; mineral fiber-reinforced plate	BIODEGRADABLE IMPLANTS; BIOABSORBABLE IMPLANTS; MACROPHAGE PLASTICITY; TISSUE-REPAIR; FRACTURE; FIXATION; REMOVAL; POLARIZATION	Biointegrative, mineral fiber-reinforced bone fixation implants recently introduced in orthopedic surgery have expanded available treatment options for fractures and bone deformities. This new technology aims to address the disadvantages of permanent metallic implants while overcoming inherent concerns of adverse inflammatory reactions when using polymer-based orthopedic implants. The purpose of this double-arm preclinical study was to evaluate the safety, biocompatibility, and biointegration of fiber-reinforced plates, following implantation on the tibias of eight sheep. Left tibias underwent periosteal elevation, allowing for implant attachment directly onto the cortical surface; right tibia plates were implanted over intact periosteum. Microcomputed tomography and histopathology were performed at 13, 26, 52, 78, 104, and 134 weeks postimplantation. All animals were evaluated clinically at each time point, with no evidence of local adverse reactions. Histopathology demonstrated anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophages and multinucleated giant cells corresponding to implant bioabsorption, similar for both groups at each time point, and indicating expected implant biocompatibility. Inflammatory cells (i.e., eosinophils, lymphophyctes, plasma cells, and M1-like macrophages) were absent throughout the study. The bioabsorption process had started at 13 W, with the highest rate at 52-78 W. At 104 W, only residual polymer material was left (& SIM;5% of implant area). Low amounts of mineral fibers were evident at 78 W and were absent (fully remodeled) by 104 W. At 134 W, implants at both sites were fully bioabsorbed. In conclusion, these new fiber-reinforced implants demonstrated bone remodeling and complete biointegration, with no adverse tissue response. Clinical significance: In this double-arm, 2.5-year study, a biointegrative, fiber-reinforced plate implanted on the tibias of sheep was fully absorbed within 134 weeks, with no adverse tissue reaction. Bioabsorption was similar, with or without periosteal elevation, mimicking conditions like those observed in traumatic injuries disrupting the periosteum, open reduction and internal fixation, or minimally invasive surgeries. These results demonstrate the feasibility, versatility, and safety of this new class of biointegrative bone implants. This newly developed technology avoids the complications of the removal of metal implants.

J	Kim, JW; Oh, CW; Kim, BS; Jung, GH; Lee, DH				Kim, Joon-Woo; Oh, Chang-Wug; Kim, Beom-Soo; Jung, Gu-Hee; Lee, Dong-Hyun			Structure-mechanical analysis of various fixation constructs for basicervical fractures of the proximal femur and clinical implications; finite element analysis	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Proximal femur; Basicervical fracture; Internal fixation; Finite element analysis	SLIDING HIP SCREW; INTERTROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; FEMORAL FRACTURES; GAMMA-NAIL	Objective: This present study was conducted to determine the structural-mechanical stability of various fixation constructs through finite element (FE) analysis following simulation of a basicervical fracture and to introduce the clinical implications.Materials and Methods: We simulated fracture models by using a right synthetic femur (SAWBONES (R)). We imported the implant models into ANSYS (R) for placement in an optimal position. Five assembly mod-els were constructed: (1) multiple cancellous screws (MCS), (2) FNS (femoral neck system (R)), (3) dynamic hip screw (DHS), (4) DHS with anti-rotation 7.0 screw (DHS + screw), and PFNA-II (Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation-II (R)). The femur model's distal end was completely fixed and 7 degrees abducted. We set the force vector at a 3 degrees angle laterally and 15 degrees posteriorly from the vertical ground. Analysis was done using Ansys (R) software with von Mises stress (VMS) in megapascals (MPa) and displacement (mm)Results: The displacements of the proximal femur were 10.25 mm for MCS, 9.66 mm for DHS, 9.44 mm for DHS + screw, 9.86 mm for FNS, and 9.31 mm for PFNA-II. The maximum implant VMS was 148.94 MPa for MCS, 414.66 MPa for DHS, 385.59 MPa for DSH + screw, 464.07 MPa for FNS, and 505.07 MPa for PFNA-II. The maximum VMS at the fracture site was 621.13 MPa for MCS, 464.14 MPa for DHS, 64.51 MPa for DHS + screw, 344.54 MPa for FNS, and 647.49 MPa for PFNA-II. The maximum VMS at the fracture site was in the superior area with the high point around the posterior screw in the MCS, anterosuperior corner in the DHS, the posteroinferior site of the FNS, and posterosuperior site around the entry point in the PFNA-II. In the DHS + screw, the stresses were distributed evenly and disappeared at the maximum VMS fracture site.Conclusion: Based on the fracture site and implant's stress distribution, the model receiving the optimal load was a DHS + screw construct, and the FNS implant could be applied to anatomically reduced frac-tures without comminution. Considering the high-stress concentration around the entry point, a PFNA-II fixation has a high probability of head-neck fragment rotational instability.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Anatomical Location of Initial and Repeat Mandible Fractures: A 5-Year, Multi-Institution Retrospective Study	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							FIXATION PLATES; UNITED-STATES; PATTERNS	Purpose: The purpose of the present study was to investigate new fracture patterns resulting from low velocity mechanisms in subjects who had previously fractured their mandible and had been treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) or closed reduction. Methods and Materials: A multi-institutional retrospective cohort study was designed to analyze subjects presenting at 2 tertiary care centers with mandibular fractures with specific interest in subjects who had repeat mandible fractures. Variables recorded included demographic (age, sex, etc) data, fracture location of all fractures treated, and the location of previous fracture. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were completed of the data. Results: The sample included a total of 492 subjects and 875 total fractures from both institutions. Four hundred fourty-four (91.1%) were male. The average age of all subjects was 36.4 +/- 14.9 years. Twenty-six (5.28%) subjects were previously treated for a mandible fracture. All subjects' subsequent fractures occurred outside of previous ORIF except for 1 subject. Original fracture location (P = .596) and previous ORIF type (P = .689) did not influence if the subsequent fracture was within a site of previous ORIF. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that repeat mandible fractures are relatively rare, likely to occur only 5% of the time at large tertiary care centers. The repeat fracture is not likely to occur in a site of previous ORIF, regardless of the ORIF modality. Furthermore, the fracture is likely to occur on the contralateral side. This is 1 of the largest data sets on repeat mandible fractures, which, given their rarity, are difficult to study. (C) 2021 The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

Many experts in orthopedic surgery recommend the use of a Delta external fixator for type III Pilon fracture treatment. This device can promote immediate healing of fractured bone, minimizing the rate of complications as well as allowing early mobilization. The characteristics of different types of the Delta frame have not been demonstrated yet. By using the finite element method, this study was conducted to determine the biomechanical characteristics of six different configurations (Model 1 until Model 6). CT images from the lower limb of a healthy human were used to reconstruct three-dimensional models of foot and ankle bones. All bones were assigned with isotropic material properties and the cartilages were assigned to exhibit hyperelasticity. A linear link was used to simulate 37 ligaments at the ankle joint. Axial loads of 70 and 350N were applied at the proximal tibia to simulate the stance and swing phase. The metatarsals and calcaneus were fixed distally in order to prevent rigid body motion. A synthetic ankle bone was used to validate the finite element model. The simulated results showed that Delta3 produced the highest relative micromovement (0.09mm, 7m) during the stance and swing phase, respectively. The highest equivalent von Mises stress was found at the calcaneus pin of the Delta4 (423.2MPa) as compared to others. In conclusion, Delta1 external fixator was the most favorable option for type III Pilon fracture treatment.

Effect of Radial Head Implant Shape on Radiocapitellar Joint Congruency	JOURNAL OF HAND SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME			English	Article						Radius; arthroplasty; 3-dimensional reconstruction; computed tomographic imaging; joint contact mechanics	IMAGE-BASED TECHNIQUE; IN-VITRO; CONTACT MECHANICS; ELBOW FLEXION; ARTHROPLASTY; PROSTHESIS; DESIGN; KINEMATICS; STABILITY; REPAIR	Purpose Radial head arthroplasty is indicated in displaced fractures in which comminution precludes successful internal fixation. Many types of radial head implants have been developed varying in material, methods of fixation, and degrees of modularity and geometry. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of radial head implant shape on radiocapitellar joint congruency. Methods Joint congruency was quantified in 7 cadaveric specimens employing a registration and inter-surface distance algorithm and 3-dimensional models obtained using computed tomography. Forearm rotation was simulated after computer-guided implantation of an axisymmetric radial head, a population-based quasi-anatomic radial head implant, and a reverse-engineered anatomic radial head implant. Inter-surface distances were measured to investigate the relative position of the radial head implant and displayed on 3-dimensional color-contour maps. Surface area was measured for inter-surface distances (1.5 mm) and compared for each radial head geometry. Results There were no statistical differences in the contact surface area between radial head implants during active or passive forearm rotation. The joint was more congruent (larger contact surface area) during active forearm rotation compared with passive forearm rotation. Conclusions This study investigated the effect of implant geometry on the radiocapitellar joint contact mechanics by examining a commercially available radial head system (axisymmetric), a quasi-anatomic design, and an anatomic reverse-engineered radial head implant. We found no statistical differences in radiocapitellar joint contact mechanics as measured by 3-dimensional joint congruency in cadaveric specimens undergoing continuous simulated forearm rotation.

Outcomes of type II superior labrum, anterior to posterior (SLAP) repair: Prospective evaluation at a minimum two-year follow-up	JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY			English	Article						Labrum; SLAP lesion; shoulder arthroscopy; superior labrum anterior to posterior	ARTHROSCOPIC TREATMENT; ROTATOR CUFF; LESIONS; INSTABILITY; FIXATION; SHOULDER; TACK	Hypothesis: Patients with type 11 superior labrum, anterior to posterior (SLAP) lesions will have improved function and decreased pain at a minimum of 2 years after arthroscopic SLAP repair using bioabsorbable suture anchor fixation. Materials and methods: The study population consisted of 48 patients who underwent arthroscopic SLAP repair. Subjective shoulder scores, range of motion, and strength (postoperative only) were assessed preoperatively and at a minimum of 2 years postoperatively. Results: At an average of 3.4 years after surgery, statistically significant improvement was seen in American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, University of California, Los Angeles score, Simple Shoulder Test scores, Constant activities of daily living, visual analog scale for pain, and Short Form-12 Health Survey physical outcome scores. Improvements were made in forward flexion, abduction, external rotation, and internal rotation. Subgroup analysis of nonathletes, nonoverhead athletes, recreational overhead athletes, and collegiate overhead athletes showed preoperative to postoperative improvements in subjective outcomes scores. Overhead laborers and nonlaborers also showed preoperative to postoperative improvements in subjective shoulder scores. Discussion: No differences were seen between the outcomes of nonathletes, nonoverhead athletes, recreational overhead athletes, and collegiate overhead athletes, suggesting that SLAP type II repair is successful independent of the patient's vocation or sport. Conclusion: These results show that arthroscopic SLAP repair of type II lesions with bioabsorbable suture anchors provides a significant improvement in functional capacity and pain relief.

Data on mean skeletal stability and complications for the 2 techniques were retrieved from these articles Results: Based on the articles about stability, patients undergoing BSSO or NIDO with all advancement or lengthening between 6 and 10 mill showed a similar mean skeletal relapse of 15.0% and 17 1%, respectively, within postoperative months 6 to 12. Greater skeletal relapse was reported for BSSO patients with high mandibular plane angles compared with normal mandibular plane angle patients (29.6% vs 11.3%). Based oil the articles about complications, patients who underwent MDO showed a lower incidence of persistent inferior alveolar nerve disturbance (2.9%) andcondylar resorption (1.4%) compared with BSSO patients, in whom the incidence of these conditions wits 27.8% anti 6 1%, respectively. Conclusion: Both BSSO and MDO showed similar relapse rates for mandibular advancements between 6 and 10 mm.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the motion of the syndesmosis under different loading patterns and determine the characteristics of the syndesmotic motion. Methods: Six fresh cadaveric lower extremity specimens with the knee reserved were tested in this study. The skin and muscles were removed with all ligaments around the syndesmosis and knee and ankle joint intact. An axial load of 600 N was applied to the specimens with the ankle joint in 10 degrees dorsiflexion, neutral position, and 15 degrees plantar flexion using a universal material testing machine. Then, with the ankle joint positioned neutrally, a combination of 600-N axial and 5-Nm torsional external rotation loading was applied to the specimens. The medial-lateral and anterior-posterior displacement and rotation of the distal fibula relative to the distal tibia were measured. Results: Under the axial loading, the distal fibula tended to move medially and anteriorly and rotate internally with the ankle positioned from the neutral position to 15 degrees plantar flexion. Meanwhile, when the ankle was positioned from the neutral position to 10 degrees dorsiflexion, the distal fibula tended to move laterally and posteriorly and rotate externally. Under the combined loading, with respect to the isolated axial loading, the distal fibula tended to move medially and posteriorly, and rotate externally relative to the distal tibia. Conclusion: Micro motion existed in the syndesmosis. The relative motion of the syndesmosis was correlated to the ankle position and loading patterns.

J	Guedes, S; Sousa-Pinto, B; Torres, J				Guedes, Sara; Sousa-Pinto, Bernardo; Torres, Joao			Radiological outcomes of bimalleolar fractures: Are timing of surgery and type of reconstruction important?	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Bimalleolar ankle fractures; Surgical timing; ORIF; Radiographs; Talocrural angle; Medial clear space; Tibiofibular overlap; Tibiofibular clear space	ANKLE FRACTURES; SYNDESMOTIC INJURIES; FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES; FIXATION; REDUCTION; MANAGEMENT; ANATOMY	Objective: The goal of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of bimalleolar ankle fractures is to reconstitute ankle anatomy. The most commonly used radiological parameters to assess adequacy of reduction are talocrural angle (TCA), medial clear space (MCS), tibiofibular overlap (TFO) and tibiofibular clear space (TFCS). There is little research about the radiological outcomes of surgery in bimalleolar fractures. We aimed at assessing the adequacy of ORIF and the factors involved in anatomical restoration (specifically time to surgery), postoperatively and at follow-up.Methods: TCA, MCS, TFO and TFCS were measured in preoperative and postoperative radiographs of 107 bimalleolar ankle fractures and in 83 follow-up radiographs, accounting for a total of 297 radiographs and 1182 measurements. Preoperative radiographs were categorized according to Danis-Weber clas-sification. For all included cases, basic demographic data, dates of radiographs and surgery, and type of fixation used were acquired. Variables associated with postoperative and follow-up total anatomical reconstitution (i.e., when the four assessed radiological parameters were normalized), normalization of each radiological parameter, and improvement in the number of normalized radiological parameters were identified through univariable Cox regression analysis.Results: In our sample, 23.8% of the ankle fractures in postoperative radiographs and 28% in follow-up radiographs achieved a complete anatomical restoration. Type C fractures (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.02-0.7, P = 0.021) were associated with lower chances of total anatomi-cal reconstitution. The use of reconstruction plates (HR = 0.1, 95% CI = 0.03-0.7, P = 0.014) and one third tubular plates (HR = 0.2, 95% CI = 0.03-0.8, P = 0.026) decreased the chances of improving the number of normalized radiological parameters. Waiting days until surgery impaired total anatomical reconstitution (HR = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.6-0.9, P = 0.012) and also reduced the chances of improving the number of normalized radiological parameters (HR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.9-1.0, P = 0.045).Conclusion: The radiological results for the treatment of bimalleolar fractures are time sensitive, and surgery should thus be performed as soon as possible, using adequate fixation materials, in order to achieve a better restoration of ankle anatomy.

J	Lu, TC; Mohammed, SM; Liao, HT				Lu, Ting-Chen; Mohammed, Shadad M.; Liao, Han-Tsung			Aesthetic Outcome of Primary Rhinoplasty of Saddle Nose Deformity in Naso-Orbital Ethmoidal Fractures in Asian Patients	JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article						naso-orbital ethmoidal fracture; rhinoplasty; saddle nose deformity	NASOETHMOID ORBITAL FRACTURES; RECONSTRUCTION; MANAGEMENT; BONE; CLASSIFICATION; SUPPORT; GRAFTS	Background:Saddle nose deformity following naso-orbital ethmoidal (NOE) fractures remain a challenging problem for the reconstructive surgeon. Early reduction and internal fixation allow for fracture stabilization but is unable to address the problem of the depressed nasal dorsum, especially after soft tissue shrinkage. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcome of primary rhinoplasty in patients with NOE fractures. Materials and Methods:From 2016 to 2019, 9 patients presented to our department with NOE fractures complicated by saddle nose deformity underwent primary nasal reconstruction at the time of their fracture fixation. Life size (1:1) frontal and lateral postoperative photographs were taken. Three objective measurements were made, including the nasofrontal angle, tip projection, and radix projection. These measurements were compared between normal persons (group 1), preoperative patients (group 2), and postoperative patients (group 3). Nose aesthetic assessment was carried out via a panel assessment using a Visual Analog Scale of 5. Patient satisfaction was further assessed subjectively by the patient themselves using the Visual Analog Scale. Results:When comparing group 3 to 2, a significant reduction in the nasofrontal angles was found with an accompanying increase in the radix and tip projection (P<0.05). No statistical significance between normal persons and postprimary rhinoplasty patients was noted between groups 1 and 3. Average patient satisfaction scored 3.86 +/- 1.07 compared with 3.63 +/- 0.84 by laypersons and 4 +/- 0.77 by specialists' panel. Conclusion:Primary nasal reconstruction may be an alternative method for achieving optimum results following NOE fractures preventing the development of secondary saddle nose deformity with a shortened nose which may potentially be more difficult to correct.

However, excessive sliding is related to poor postoperative outcomes. We aimed to identify the risk factors for excessive sliding. Materials and Methods: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study including 115 trochanteric fractures sustained through low-energy trauma in 19 male and 96 female patients aged 60 years or older (mean age: 82.9 years) between September 2013 and December 2014. We measured the postoperative sliding distance after osteosynthesis using a sliding hip screw or intramedullary nailing, and classified participants with >= 8 mm of sliding into the excessive sliding group (ESG) and with <8 mm into non-ESG. Finally, we investigated the risk factors of excessive postoperative sliding. Results: Fifty participants were classified into the ESG and 65 participants into the non-ESG. Female sex (p = 0.0264), an A3 fracture type (p = 0.0003), greater tip-apex distance (p = 0.0250), and poor reduction in either the anteroposterior or lateral radiographic views (p = 0.0156) were identified as risk factors for excessive sliding by multivariate regression analysis. Conclusions: Female sex, an unstable fracture type, a greater tip-apex distance, and a poor reduction, in either the anteroposterior or lateral views, are associated with excessive postoperative sliding. Therefore, surgery should aim to achieve good reduction and stabilization from both radiographic views. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Material/Methods: In a series of 400 participants, based on measurement results regarding the distribution of femoral arteries in the medial femur, the femoral portion covering that part was divided into levels A-E. The center region, margin region, and risky area in the medial femur were defined. The frequency of femoral arteries and interested shortest distance between the outer femur and superficial, deep, and perforating femoral arteries (SFAs, DFAs, and PFAs) in the center region, margin region, and risky area at each level were recorded. Results: There were 173 males and 227 females (average age: 63.61 +/- 19.18 years) in this study. The starting point and end point for femoral arteries in the medial femur were from 22.55 +/- 4.23% to 54.56 +/- 8.39% of the whole femur. The femoral arteries in the medial femur mainly were distributed at levels B (88.2%), C (65.9%), and D (40.6%). The femoral arteries in center regions in the risky area, most of which were DFAs and PFAs, were mainly concentrated at levels B (26.93%) and C (11.81%). Conclusions: The mid-shaft level was the most risky level, and the DFAs and PFAs were easier to injure than the SFAs when performing internal fixation of proximal femoral fracture. We recommended that great attention be paid to drill and screw insertion around the mid-shaft level for prevention of iatrogenic vascular injury.

Materials and Methods: The 42 subjects were divided into 3 groups according to the osteosynthesis method applied. To evaluate the intersegmental displacements from immediately after surgery (T0) to 6 months after surgery (T1), 2 cone-beam computed tomographic data sets were superimposed on the symphyseal area and the lower part of the mandible below the root apex. On the superimposed 3-dimensional images, the mean and standard deviation of the differences of the coordinates (x, y, z) between T0 and T1 were calculated. Results: From T0 to T1, group B (bicortical screws) manifested the greatest condylion (Cd) and coronoid process (Cp) displacements (P < .05). In group A, the right Cd moved anteriorly and the left Cd moved anteriorly and inferiorly, whereas the right and left Cps moved anteriorly. In group B, the right and left Cps moved laterally and inferiorly. In group C, the right Cd moved anteriorly and inferiorly, the left Cd changed laterally and anteriorly, the right Cp moved anteriorly, and the left Cp moved anteriorly and inferiorly. Conclusions: In the present study, group B (bicortical screws) showed the greatest displacement after the healing period. In view of these findings, surgeons should consider carefully their choice of osteosynthesis method to effectively decrease intersegmental displacement. c 2012 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons J Oral Maxillofac Surg 70:2893-2898, 2012	[Kim, Yong-Il] Pusan Natl Univ Hosp, Biomed Res Inst, Dept Orthodont, Pusan 602739, South Korea; [Park, Soo-Byung] Pusan Natl Univ Dent Hosp, Dept Orthodont, Yangsan, South Korea; [Jung, Yun-Hoa] Pusan Natl Univ Dent Hosp, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Radiol, Yangsan, South Korea; [Hwang, Dae-Seok; Lee, Jae-Yeol] Pusan Natl Univ Hosp, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, Pusan, South Korea; Pusan Natl Univ, Pusan, South Korea	Pusan National University; Pusan National University Hospital; Pusan National University; Pusan National University Hospital; Pusan National University; Pusan National University Hospital; Pusan National University; Pusan National University Hospital; Pusan National University	Kim, YI (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ Hosp, Biomed Res Inst, Dept Orthodont, Gudeokro 305, Pusan 602739, South Korea.	kimyongil@pusan.ac.kr	Jung, Yun Hoa/ABF-5487-2021	Hwang, Daeseok/0000-0001-6899-1769	Biomedical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital	Biomedical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital	This study was supported by a grant from the Biomedical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital.		36	8	9	0	7	W B SAUNDERS CO-ELSEVIER INC	PHILADELPHIA	1600 JOHN F KENNEDY BOULEVARD, STE 1800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2899 USA	0278-2391	1531-5053		J ORAL MAXIL SURG	J.

Radial Head Arthroplasty: A Radiologic Outcome Study	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY			English	Article						arthroplasty; fracture; radial head	HETEROTOPIC OSSIFICATION; III FRACTURES; FOLLOW-UP; ELBOW; REPLACEMENT; PROSTHESIS; STABILITY; FIXATION; EXCISION; SURGERY	OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to provide a radiographic outcome assessment of radial head arthroplasty in correlation with clinical outcomes and to determine whether there is an association between certain patient factors and clinical and radiographic outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A 10-year retrospective review was performed to identify patients with metal radial head arthroplasty. At least two follow-up radiographs were reviewed for each patient and were correlated with clinical information. Statistical analysis included calculation of complication rates, phi coefficient for variable association with complications, and Kaplan-Meier survival. RESULTS. A total of 258 radial head implants in 244 patients were reviewed. The mean patient age was 46 years, with mean follow-up time of 12.8 months. Two hundred nineteen (84.9%) implants were unipolar in design, whereas 39 implants were bipolar. The most common indication for arthroplasty was trauma (94% acute and 2% failed internal fixation). Radiographic abnormalities included nonbridging heterotopic ossification (38.0%), secondary radiocapitellar joint osteoarthritis (27.9%), loosening (19.8%), bridging heterotopic ossification (8.9%), fracture (2.3%), and hardware dislocation (2.7%). Overall, there were 62 second surgeries for either revision or removal. Reasons for second surgery included heterotopic ossification (53.2%), synovectomy or capsulectomy (43.5%), and infection (3.2%). There was a statistically significant association between radiographic complications and the presence of patient symptoms (p < 0.05). There was no association between radiographic or clinical complications with age, sex, side, or type of arthroplasty (R < 0.001). CONCLUSION. There is a positive association between radiographic findings and patient symptoms for postoperative complications after radial head arthroplasty.

Methods: Fifty-one feet of 47 patients underwent surgery due to hallux valgus. Mean age was 41.2 +/- 14.0 years, and mean follow-up period was 99.5 +/- 36.0 months. Patients were evaluated with standing anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographies obtained in the preoperative and early postoperative periods, and during final follow-up. The parameters of hallux valgus angle (HVA), intermetatarsal angle (IA), metatarsal distal phalangeal angle (MDPA), and first metatarsal length (ML) were measured. For clinical evaluation, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hallux metatarsophalangeal-interphalangeal (MTP-IP) scale was used. Results: Mean preoperative HVA was 36.9 degrees +/- 7.3 degrees, mean early postoperative HVA was 16.6 degrees +/- 6.2 degrees, and mean final postoperative HVA was 28.9 degrees +/- 11.5 degrees. Mean preoperative IA was 17.3 degrees +/- 4.5 degrees, mean early postoperative IA was 8.8 degrees +/- 3.6 degrees, and mean final postoperative IA was 14.3 degrees +/- 4.9 degrees. Mean AOFAS hallux MTP-IP score was 71.9 +/- 20.1 at final follow-up. Conclusion: From studies in the available literature, it is not clear whether the proximal open-wedge osteotomy technique itself is unsuccessful in adults or the lack of internal fixation led to failure. Application of an adequate fixation material should be used in order to avoid the collapse of the graft and to maintain the correction of the radiological parameters.

The insertion of the so-called "Herbert bone screw" was tested on phantom models of the mandible. Materials and Methods: A total of ten synthetic models of the lower jaw were prepared with navigational markers. After inducing artificial fractures in the mandibular angle region, axial CT scans of the models with 1.5-mm slice thickness were performed. The CT data was then transferred to the workstation of the navigation system (STN-Zeiss Navigation System, Aalen, Germany). The access to the fracture and the drilling depth were planned preoperatively on the computer monitor using the software. After calibration of the drill wire, the carmulated traction screws were inserted under three-dimensionally directed computer navigation. Results: The inferior alveolar nerve of the model was spared in all ten cases. Cortical perforation occurred twice in the ascending lower jaw branch, but secure anchorage of the screw was still possible in every case. Conclusion: The navigation system is a helpful visualization tool that can prevent damage to the inferior alveolar nerve and enable secure anchoring of the traction screw centrally in the cortical bone without causing perforation. This computer guided insertion method enables stable fixation of the fracture via minimally invasive surgery. Positioning of a traction screw with additional tools belonging to the screw system (drill wire) is demonstrated.

Numerous techniques and surgical approaches have been proposed for tibiotalar (TT) and tibiotalocalcaneal (TTC) arthrodesis, from arthroscopic to open, as well as numerous devices proposed for internal fixation (retrograde intramedullary nails, cannulated screws, and plating systems). The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the results, with at least 18 months of follow-up, with Silverback (TM) TT/TTC Plating System Paragon28 in a group of 20 patients with severe OA and hindfoot deformities (mainly secondary post-traumatic OA). Materials and Methods: The demographic characteristics and past medical history of the patients were collected and analyzed to identify the cause of the pathology. The degree of OA and deformity were quantified based on foot and ankle weight-bearing radiography and CT examination. Pre- and post-operative clinical and functional scores (ROM, VAS, AOFAS, FFI, and SF-36) and radiographic parameters (anterior distal tibial angle, tibiotalar angle, coronal tibiotalar angle, and hindfoot alignment angle) were evaluated. Results: All of the patients showed clinical and radiographic fusion at an average of 14 weeks (range 12-48), with improvement in pain and functional scores, without major surgical complications and/or infections. Conclusions: Despite the limitations of our study, the results with this new plating system showed good results in terms of bone consolidation, post-operative complications, and improvement of pain and quality of life in patients with severe OA and deformities of the ankle and hindfoot.

In vitro osteoblast response to ferritic stainless steel fiber networks for magneto-active layers on implants	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A			English	Article						stainless steel; fiber networks; scaffold; osteoblast; mineralization	MARROW STROMAL OSTEOBLASTS; SOFT-TISSUE RESPONSE; PROTEIN ADSORPTION; PERFUSION CULTURE; BONE-FORMATION; CELLS; MESH; DIFFERENTIATION; PROLIFERATION; PHENOTYPE	The use of a porous coating on prosthetic components to encourage bone ingrowth is an important way of improving uncemented implant fixation. Enhanced fixation may be achieved by the use of porous magneto-active layers on the surface of prosthetic implants, which would deform elastically on application of a magnetic field, generating internal stresses within the in-growing bone. This approach requires a ferromagnetic material able to support osteoblast attachment, proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization. In this study, the human osteoblast responses to ferromagnetic 444 stainless steel networks were considered alongside those to nonmagnetic 316L (medical grade) stainless steel networks. While both networks had similar porosities, 444 networks were made from coarser fibers, resulting in larger inter-fiber spaces. The networks were analyzed for cell morphology, distribution, proliferation, and differentiation, extracellular matrix production and the formation of mineralized nodules. Cell culture was performed in both the presence of osteogenic supplements, to encourage cell differentiation, and in their absence. It was found that fiber size affected osteoblast morphology, cytoskeleton organization and proliferation at the early stages of culture. The larger inter-fiber spaces in the 444 networks resulted in better spatial distribution of the extracellular matrix. The addition of osteogenic supplements enhanced cell differentiation and reduced cell proliferation thereby preventing the differences in proliferation observed in the absence of osteogenic supplements. The results demonstrated that 444 networks elicited favorable responses from human osteoblasts, and thus show potential for use as magnetically active porous coatings for advanced bone implant applications.

The aim of this study is to assess the densitometric and mechanical characteristics of these regions when using a proximal humerus locking plate (PHLP). Materials and methods: Nineteen PHLPs were mounted on cadaveric humeri using only their three most distal screws. Subsequently, the plates were removed and the bones were scanned using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography. Bone mineral density (BMD) was determined in the intact proximal epiphysis and in the exact locations where the six proximal screws would have been positioned concluding the instrumentation. Each plate was then repositioned on its bone and a minimally destructive local torque measurement was performed in the same six locations. A statistical analysis was performed to detect significant differences in the investigated parameters between screw positions, and to test the ability of local torque values to discriminate the bone mineral density of the entire humeral head (BMDTOT). Results: Novel data about the cancellous bone engaged by the screws of a PHLP are provided. Different epiphyseal locations showed statistically significant different properties. A local torque measurement was a good predictor of the BMDTOT. Conclusion: Position and direction of the epiphyseal screws on a locking implant are determinant to engage bone regions with significantly better bone quality. A breakaway torque measurement in a given screw position can distinguish between humeral heads with different densitometric properties. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A cheap and effective scoliotic deformity correction method is reviewed in this article. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of spinal loop rectangle and sub laminar wires as a modality for spinal deformity correction and its co-relation with patients' satisfaction and clinical outcome. Material and Methods: Thirty six patients of scoliotic spinal deformities with various etiologies (congenital-4, idiopathic-25, neurofibromatosis-3, neuromuscular-2 and 'syndromic'-3) with ages ranging from 8 to 23 years underwent corrective posterior spinal arthrodesis with stainless steel Hartshill loop rectangle and sublaminar wires. Clinicoradiological evaluation was done at an average follow-up of 6 1/2 years (min-2 1/2, years). Along with clinicoradiological outcome, patient satisfaction (as per the SRS 24), was accounted. Results: Average preoperative Cobb's angle were 73.25 degrees in the entire group and 66.48 degrees in the idiopathic group. Average percentage correction was 64.34% in the entire group and the (average degree of correction was 47.13). In the idiopathic group, the respective values were 69.19% and 46 degrees. Loss of correction in the whole group was 2.2 degrees at two year follow up. Sagittal profiles, truncal balance were well corrected too; minimal complications were seen. Patient satisfaction results were encouraging in 36 patients as per - SRS24). About 80.2% patients were ready to undergo the same surgery if required. (SRS24). Conclusion: Segmental spinal fixation with locally made spinal loop rectangle and sublaminar wires is comparable as a modality to correct scoliotic spinal deformities.

Materials and methods Thirty-three patients (20 female, 13 male, median age 67 years, range 35-85 years) with displaced proximal humerus fractures were included. After reduction and fixation, an intra-operative 3D fluoroscopy was performed to evaluate primary screw perforations (PS) and screws with "near perforation" (nPS). These screws were changed intra-operatively. Patients were followed-up for a minimum of 12 months. Clinical and radiological parameters, such as secondary screw perforation, secondary loss of reduction, or functional outcome, were investigated. Results In six patients (18.2%), humeral head screws were changed due to primary PS (n = 2) or nPS (n = 4) after the intra-operative 3D fluoroscopy. Follow-up revealed an adapted constant score (%CMS) of 76.2% after a mean follow-up of 17.7 months. Two secondary screw perforations were observed (6%). Loss of reduction was observed in eight patients (24.2%). Conclusion The intra-operative 3D reveals a high rate of primary screw perforations or near perforations. Immediate change of these screws may lead to a lower rate of secondary screw perforations and, therefore, reduce post-operative complications.

Methods: We prospectively recruited 29 patients who were treated with this technique between 2010 and 2018. The type of suture used, tourniquet time and surgical time were analyzed for each one. X-rays were taken after 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 6 months, recording complications, causes, rates of re-operation and the final clinical condition. Results: Median time for ischemia and surgery were 51 (95% CI:48;62) and 45 (95% CI:42;55) minutes respectively. The radiologic studies showed diastasis of the posterior cortex in the X-rays taken after 2 weeks and after 6 weeks in 7 (24,1%) cases. Of these cases, two (6,8%) were no longer followed-up after 6 months. There was only one case of aseptic non-union. Among these cases, two patients (6.8%) required surgical debridement due to acute soft tissue infection. No complication had any clinical impact, maintaining all patients full range of motion and no pain. Osteosynthesis removal was not necessary in any case. Conclusion: Transosseous suture with high strength thread is a valid alternative for treating Mayo IIA olecranon fractures in adult patients, decreasing re-operation rates for implant removal. There may be, in a moderate percentage of cases, radiologic diastasis of the posterior cortex at the fracture site, without causing pain nor limiting mobility (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Few reports focused on management of treatment failure. Objective: The study hypothesis was that the induced-membrane technique associated in a 2-stage strategy to internal fixation provides systematic bone healing in refractory humeral non-union. Material and methods: The study included 15 patients, with a median age of 46.6 years, with humeral non-union of a mean 24 months' progression and mean history of 3 attempted revision surgeries. Seven patients showed bone defect, exceeding 5 cm in 2 cases. Six had history of radial palsy. Results: Consolidation was achieved in all cases, at a mean 4.6 months. Ten patients underwent radial nerve transposition, 6 of whom had shown radial motor nerve palsy; all recovered within 2 to 5 months. There was 1 case of superficial infection, and 1 of seroma. Discussion: The induced-membrane technique ensures bone healing due to the biological properties of the membrane; the main drawback is the need for 2-stage surgery. When bone defect exceeds 5 cm, a multi-perforated fibula segment can be placed inside the membrane to increase primary stability and enhance bone integration. Conclusion: The induced-membrane technique is suited to humeral non-union, with or without bone defect. The 2-stage strategy is mandatory in case of suspected latent infection. In the 2-stage procedure, anteromedial radial nerve transposition facilitates the bone-graft stage. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

A biomechanical study on variation of compressive force along the Acutrak 2 screw	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Acutrak 2 screw; Compressive force; Scaphoid fracture	INTERFRAGMENTARY COMPRESSION; BONE SCREWS; MODEL	Introduction: Acutrak 2 screws are commonly used for scaphoid fracture fixation. To our knowledge, the variation in compressive force along the screw has not been investigated before. The objectives of our study were to measure variance in compression along the length of the standard Acutrak 2 screw, to identify the region of the screw which produces the greatest compression and to discuss the clinical relevance of this to the placement of the screw for scaphoid fractures. Materials and methods: A laboratory model was set up to test the compressive force at 2 mm intervals along the screw, using solid polyurethane foam (Sawbone) blocks of varying width. The Acutrak 2 screws were introduced in the standard method. Forces were measured using a custom-made load cell washer introduced between the Sawbone blocks and were plotted as a graph along the whole length of the screw. Results: Maximum compression was at the mid-point of the screw. Overall compressive forces were higher in the proximal half of the screw by 19% when compared with the distal half. Minimum compression was seen at 4 mm or less from either end of the screw. Conclusions: There is variation in compression along the length of the standard Acutrak 2 screw and the maximum compression was obtained at the mid-point of the screw. From this study, we would recommend when using an Acutrak 2 screw for internal fixation of scaphoid fractures, to attain maximum compressive force, place the fracture at the mid-point of the Acutrak screw. If this is not possible, then place the fracture towards the proximal half of the screw. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Sugathan, Hari Kovilazhikathu; Harrison, John W.

Several reconstruction techniques are published, with different types of configurations and fixation methods of the tendon grafts. However, failure of the reconstruction with recurrent instability is still a problem, despite stable graft to bone fixation. Augmentation of the free tendon graft with non-resorbable suture material is gaining popularity, aiming to withstand elongation or rupture of the graft. The purpose of this study was to compare two different augmented ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction methods in a cadaver model.Methods: Ten matched pairs of cadaveric upper extremities were used. The thumbs were disarticulated at the trapezometacarpal joint and the ulnar collateral ligament was excised then reconstructed with InternalBraceTM reinforced tendon graft, which was fixed to the bones using either a Tenodesis screw or DX Swivelock (R) anchor. The thumbs were biomechanically tested with valgus stress, while the force and displacement were simulta-neously measured and plotted.Findings: The mean (SD) load at clinical failure and maximum load were 19.4 (5.3) and 31.4 (9.5) N in the Tenodesis group, and 21.0 (10.0) and 31.4 (13.9) N in the DX SwiveLock (R) group, respectively. None of these differences were significant. These results are comparable with previous publications.Interpretation: The Tenodesis screw and the DX SwiveLock (R) thumb ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction with InternalBraceTM reinforced free tendon graft showed equal strength, both methods are feasible alternatives in the clinical setting.

The aim of this study is to discuss the method and curative effects of vacuum sealing drainage (VSD) treatment combined with skin flap transplantation and antibiotic bone cement for chronic tibia osteomyelitis. Material/Methods: For this study, 18 cases of open fracture secondary chronic tibia osteomyelitis were selected. After the granulation tissue of the wound surface became fresh and infection was controlled, the wound surface was repaired with a medial head of gastrocnemius transfer flap or a myofascial and cutaneous island pedicle flap with a collateral vessel nourished by the retrograde sural nerve. VSD combined with focus debridement and antibiotic bone cement filling was conducted. After inflammation was completely regulated, elective bone cement extraction, bone grafting, and internal fixation were performed. Within 2 to 3 years of follow-up post-surgery, the satisfaction and recurrence rates were evaluated. The patients' pre-operative and post-operative recovery of limb functions were compared according to the Enneking scoring system. Results: The patients did not suffer from osteomyelitis recurrence, with the exception of 1 case that manifested osteomyelitis recurrence and recovered through surgical treatment within the period of follow-up. The satisfaction and recurrence rates of these study cases post-surgery were 94.4% and 5.6%, respectively. The average functional recovery post-surgery was 81.5% of normal function. Conclusions: Vacuum sealing drainage combined with skin flap transplantation and antibiotic bone cement is an effective treatment for chronic tibia osteomyelitis.

Increased Osteoid Formation in BMP-2-Loaded Silk-Based Screws	PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY			English	Article							BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN-2; INTERNAL-FIXATION; BIOMATERIAL SCAFFOLDS; BIOABSORBABLE PLATES; MANDIBULAR FRACTURES; ABSORBABLE PLATES; RESORBABLE PLATES; BOMBYX-MORI; IN-VITRO; FIBROIN	Background: Resorbable osteosynthesis systems are used to treat craniofacial fractures. However, conventional synthetic polyester materials are potentially associated with inflammatory reaction and negative host response and may result in incomplete bone remodeling. The authors have developed a resorbable silk fibroin-based osteosynthesis system and propose that silk screws loaded with bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) may exhibit biocompatibility and promote bone remodeling. Methods: Resorbable silk screws were prepared and loaded with BMP-2. The BMP-2-loaded and nonloaded silk screws were inserted into the distal femora in 15 Sprague-Dawley rats by self-tapping, similar to conventional metal systems. Animals were euthanized after 1, 3, and 6 months. The femora were explanted at the designated time points, dissected for histologic evaluation, and compared regarding osteoid formation and inflammatory response. Results: Increasing organization of newly formed bone tissue was observed over time in both groups. No appreciable difference in inflammation was noted between the BMP-2-loaded and nonloaded silk screws. Notably, mineralized collagen around the periphery of the screw appears to be greatest and more organized in the BMP-2-loaded samples. There was greater recruitment of osteoclasts and osteoblasts around the perimeter of the BMP-2-loaded screws at 3 and 6 months. Conclusions: The BMP-2-loaded silk-based fixation device in this study exhibited characteristics comparable to the current nonloaded silk screws with regard to integration and biocompatibility. However, functionalization of silk screws with BMP-2 appeared to allow for more organized collagen and osteoid deposition after 3 and 6 months and may increase the potential of successful remodeling.

Materials and methods: Between 1998 and 2001 98 patients with 100 fractures of the proximal humerus were treated surgically by a single surgeon with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) (51/100, group A, median age 54 years; range, 21-88) or with hemiarthroplasty (49/100, group B, median age 66 years; range, 38-87). Seventy-six of 98 patients were available for re-evaluation at a mean follow-up of five years (3.3-7.3) using the Constant-Murley score (CMS), the Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV), and conventional radiographs. Results: The median total CMS was 77 (range, 37-98) for group A and 70 (range, 39-84) for group B. The median SSV was 92 (range, 40-100) for group A and 90 (range, 40-100) for group B. Avascular necrosis occured in 6/40 fractures treated with ORIF. Conclusion: Osteosynthesis and hemiarthroplasty yield similar functional results and comparable patient satisfaction following the applied decision making process in this selected patient cohort. Osteosynthesis with preservation of the humeral head is worth considering when adequate reduction and stable conditions for revascularization can be obtained. In patients with osteopenic bone and/or comminuted fractures, hemiarthroplasty is a viable alternative. Level of evidence: Level 2; Prospective non-randomized comparison study.

Materials and methods: The sample consisted of 30 subjects (14 males and 16 females) who underwent bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy (BSSRO) for mandibular setback using the poly-L/DL-lactide plate system (Biosorb FX (R), Linvatec Biornaterials Ltd., Tampere, Finland). The lateral cephalometric radiographs of each subject were taken pre-operatively within I month (TO), post-operatively within I month (T 1), and post-operatively between 4 and 10 months (T2) and skeletal changes were analyzed with V-Ceph (CyberMed (R), Seoul, Korea) software. The changes between T1 and T2 were evaluated with a paired t-test to estimate the stability of the surgery. The post-operative changes of mandibular body length and ramus height were used for a K-means clustering analysis to separate subjects into either the less changed (1,C), or the more changed (MC) group. The two groups were compared with TO and the surgical changes (T1 - T0) using the t-test. Results: Significant relapse after surgery was shown in vertical measurements but not in the horizontal plane measurements. The MC group showed significantly more vertical operative changes than the LC group independent of horizontal measurements. Conclusions: Usage of a bioabsorbable plate in mandibular setback surgery could provide stable fixation in the horizontal dimension, but also may allow an increase of vertical relapse due to the increase in vertical dimension post-operatively.

However, its mechanical properties are still not satisfied. To improve its mechanical properties, we examined the hydrostatic extrusion procedure on the PLLA rods made by Injection Molding process. The extrusion ratio was adjusted to 3, 6, 9, and 12. The molecular weight of the PLLA decreased from 260,000 to 200,000 after injection molding process, but it did not change during the hydrostatic extrusion procedure. The melting point of PLLA hydrostatic extrusion products were increased with the extrusion ratio, but the increment was not obviouse. Extrusion products having low extrusion ratio had a-form crystal in them, extrusion products having high extrusion ratio had both of alpha and beta-form, crystall in them. At extrusion temperature of 145 degrees C, PLLA rods showed the best flowing trends in the pressure medium of PEG 400. Extrusion temperature is placed in the range of crystalline transition temperature and melting point of PLLA. At extrusion ratio 9 similar to 12, the extrusion products showed the best mechanical properties. The highest bending strength of the extrusion product was over than 350MPa. It is far stronger than that of the human cortical bone (200MPa). SEM observations showed that the fiber structure began to appear at an extrusion ratio ER=3, and at the extrusion ratio ER 6, the chain axes of PLLA became aligned to the extrusion direction. The structure of extrusion products at the high extrusion ratio showed highly oriented fiber structure composed of micro-fibril. At high extrusion ratio tranformation from alpha-crystal to beta-crystal was also observed.

The purpose of this study was to histologically and immunohistochemically evaluate bone formation using both self-setting alpha-tricalcium phosphate (alpha-TCP; Biopex) and absorbable plate (Super Fixsorb-MX) in rabbit cranium bone. Study design. Twelve adult male Japanese white rabbits (12-16 wk, 2.5-3.0 kg) were used. The surgical defects were made in the nasal bone of a rabbit, and Biopex was implanted in the left side and no material in the right side. Two-hole absorbable plate and 2 screws (Super Fixsorb-MX) were fixed across the defect in each side. The rabbits were killed at 1, 4, 12, and 24 weeks after surgery, and formalin-fixed specimens were embedded in acrylic resin. The specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunohistochemical analysis, the specimens were treated with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) antibodies. Finally, these were evaluated microscopically. Results. New bone formation was observed in the region of absorbable plate and nasal membrane after >4 weeks. The area of new bone with Biopex was significantly larger than that of the control side after 1, 4, and 12 weeks (P < .05). The number of BMP-2-stained cells in the experimental side was significantly larger than in the control side after 4 and 12 weeks (P < .05). Conclusion. This study suggests that the use of absorbable plate (Super Fixsorb-MX) in combination with Biopex could be useful and that both of Super Fixsorb-MX and Biopex could provide adequate bone regeneration.

The anatomy of the deltoid insertion	JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY			English	Article						Shoulder; anatomy; deltoid; shoulder arthroplasty; fracture; humerus	PROXIMAL HUMERUS; SHOULDER; SHAFT	Hypothesis: The deltoid muscle is in continuity with the distal arm fascia and musculature. Materials and methods: Ten fresh-frozen upper extremity cadaveric specimens were dissected to determine the insertional anatomy of the deltoid Muscle. Measurements were made with micro-calipers and acetate grid sheets. The deltoid tendon and fibrous aponeurosis was in continuity with the lateral intermuscular septum posteriorly and the lateral aspect of the brachialis and deep brachial fascia anteriorly in all ten specimens. This interconnection remained in continuity following complete release of the deltoid insertion. Results: The width of the insertion of the anterior head of the deltoid was a mean of 7.3 mm, the middle averaged 4.7 mm, and the posterior averaged 7.8 mm. The mean length of the anterior insertion was 70 mm, the middle was 48.4 mm, and the posterior was 63.4 mm. The mean width of the deltoid tendon and the investing fascia at the superior margin of the insertion was 21.9 mm and at the inferior margin, 13.1 mm. Discussion: Deltoid muscle integrity is critical to shoulder function. The deltoid insertion, however, is often partially released during surgical approaches for internal fixation of proximal humerus fractures and shoulder arthroplasty. Partial detachment without repair as performed during surgical approaches should not result in complete loss of continuity of the deltoid insertion. Conclusion: Knowledge of the distal insertion and interconnections of the deltoid allows for more anatomic repair following extended releases during complex fracture fixation or revision surgery. Level of evidence: Basic science study. (C) 2009 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

Long-Term Function following Periprosthetic Fractures	ACTA CHIRURGIAE ORTHOPAEDICAE ET TRAUMATOLOGIAE CECHOSLOVACA			English	Article						periprosthetic fractures; trauma; open reduction and internal fixation; revision arthroplasty	TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY; COMPRESSION PLATE FIXATION; FEMORAL-SHAFT FRACTURES; FEMUR FRACTURES; VANCOUVER TYPE-B1; HIP-ARTHROPLASTY; CLASSIFICATION; STABILIZATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; REPLACEMENTS	PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Clinical results of long-term follow-up after traumatic periprosthetic femur fractures and different therapies (ORIF vs. revision arthroplasty) MATERIAL AND METHODS The Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Harris-Hip-Score (HHS), Oxford-Hip-Score (OHS), Oxford-Knee-Score (OKS), Knee-Society -Score (KSS), SF-36 Questionnaire and Funktionsfragebogen Hannover (FFH) were used to evaluate outcome and functionality. Radiological examinations were performed and the Vancouver (THA) and Lewis and Rorabeck (TKA) classifications used. RESULTS 70 patients suffered a periprosthetic hip fracture (29x revision prosthesis, 41x ORIF), 23 patients underwent an ORIF due to periprosthetic fracture of a TKA (total mean age 75.2 years). 47 patients (follow-up rate 51%) were examined 40 months after surgery (mean age 72 years) (THA: 16x revision, 23x ORIF, TKA: 8x ORIF). The VAS revealed significant less pain in the group that had undergone revision hip arthroplasty than in the ORIF group: 3.9+/-1 vs. 5.1+/-1.7 (p<0.05), respectively. 5/16 patients with revision arthroplasty had excellent or good results in the HSS compared to 3/23 patients after ORIF. The OHS yielded excellent or good results in 12/16 patients after revision arthroplasty vs. 10/23 after ORIF. The VAS after ORIF in patients who suffered periprosthetic knee fractures was 4.9+/-2.1. 3/8 patients achieved excellent or good results according to the OKS. CONCLUSION Every functional score (HSS, OHS, FFH, SF-36) of those patients who had undergone revision arthroplasty was slightly higher and their VAS significantly lower than the scores of the patients after ORIF.

This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of distal femoral fracture treated with the application of an intramedullary fibular allogenic bone strut in open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with precontoured locking plates in patients over 50 years of age. Materials and Methods: The study retrospectively enrolled 202 patients over 50 years of age with traumatic comminuted distal femoral fracture (AO/OTA 33-A3, 33-C2 and 33-C3) treated with ORIF with a locking plate from January 2016 to December 2019. The two groups were divided into patients who received an intramedullary allogenic bone strut and those who did not. Patients were followed for at least 1 year, with their function scores and radiographic data recorded. Results: A total of 124 patients were recruited, comprising 60 men and 64 women with an average age of 62.4 +/- 8.5 years. The 36 patients who had received an intramedullary allogenic fibular bone strut reported lower postoperative pain scores at 1 month and lower postoperative Knee Society Scores (KSS) at 3 months than the control group. The application of an intramedullary allogenic fibular bone strut appeared to be significantly correlated with better 3-month postoperative KSS. Conclusions: The ORIF of distal femoral comminuted fracture with an intramedullary allogenic fibular bone strut can reduce pain and improve knee function in the early stages of postoperative rehabilitation and may reduce the time to union in patients over 50 years of age.

Predictors of wound leakage in patients undergoing surgery for neck of femur fractures	ANNALS OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF ENGLAND			English	Article						Wound leakage; Internal fixation; Hemiarthroplasty; Total hip arthroplasty	TOTAL HIP; DIABETES-MELLITUS; INFECTION; IMPACT; DRAINAGE; COMPLICATIONS; ANGIOGENESIS; REPLACEMENT	Aims Persistent wound leakage following joint arthroplasty is a known risk for periprosthetic joint infection. Little is known of the predictors of wound leakage, particularly in patients with a fractured neck of femur. We aimed to determine patient and surgical risk factors for wound leakage in this cohort. Materials and methods All patients undergoing surgery for a fractured neck of femur at Leicester Royal Infirmary between May and August 2017 were included. Patients were identified from a prospective database and placed into two groups: those with wound leakage later than three days postoperatively and those without leakage. All previously reported potential risk factors for wound leakage were compared between groups using a chi-square test and logistic regression. A Kattan-style nomogram was also created to allow probabilities output for the regression predictive models in a visual representation. Results Two hundred patients underwent surgery for a fractured neck of femur. Overall, 17% of patients (33/200) developed a persistent leaky wound. A multivariable model highlighted increased age (p= 0.01), raised body mass index (BMI; > 25 kg/m(2); p= 0.047), diabetes (p= 0.03) and intramedullary hip screw fixation (p= 0.03) as significant risk factors for wound leakage. Patients with persistent wound leakage had significantly longer hospital admission than those without (p= 0.001). Discussion Our analysis identified four perioperative risk factors for wound leakage following fractured neck of femur surgery. We also developed a novel tool to identify those patients at highest risk of leakage. Once identified, the aggressive management of certain medical comorbidities in these patients may help to reduce their incidence of wound issues and the prolonged admissions that result.	[Chong, H.

A retrospective cohort study of displaced segmental radial head fractures: is 2 mm of articular displacement an indication for surgery?	JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY			English	Article						Radial head; fracture; Mason classification; 2 mm; displacement; conservative; surgical	TRAUMA; ELBOW	Hypothesis: Many investigators agree that 2 mm of articular displacement is a reasonable indication for open reduction and internal fixation of Mason type II fractures of the radial head. However, there is no evidence to support that this degree of articular displacement is predictive of poor outcomes in conservatively treated fractures. We hypothesized there would be no difference between conservatively treated radial head fractures with greater 2 mm of displacement and those with less than 2 mm of displacement in terms of patient-reported or clinical outcomes. Materials and methods: We reviewed databases of all radial head fractures in our region. The primary outcomes were the Patient-Rated Elbow Evaluation and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaires. Secondary outcomes included radiologic radiocapitellar arthritis and range of motion (ROM) at follow-up. Postinjury treatment protocols, as well as patient factors, were examined for their effects on outcome. Results: The results showed no significant difference in any outcome for conservatively treated radial head fractures with 2 mm (P = .8) or even 3 mm (P = .6) of articular displacement over a mean follow-up of 4.4 years. Early ROM and physiotherapy showed no significant differences in any outcome measure. Dominant hand injury showed no significant difference in patient-reported outcomes; however, ROM was significantly decreased on examination. Conclusions: This retrospective review suggests that fracture displacement of 2 to 3 mm is not necessarily an indication for surgical fixation in isolated fractures of the radial head. In addition, it appears that postinjury ROM/physiotherapy does not play a large role in improving patient outcome. (C) 2013 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

Material/Methods: A patient with severe TOLF and myelopathy was treated using a lamina-lifting suspension system combined with bridge crane technique. The brief surgical procedure involved implantation of internal fixation, separation of laminae, installation of cross-bridges, reverse lifting, and fixation of cross-bridges. The modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) scale, Hirabayashi recovery rate, and ASIA grade of the patient were recorded. The canal occupation ratio (COR) and spinal cord status were evaluated by imaging data. Results: The surgical intervention significantly enhances the patient's lower limb function, as evidenced by an increase in mJOA score from 5 preoperatively to 11 at terminal follow-up. The Hirabayashi recovery rate after surgery ranges between 25% and 50%. Additionally, ASIA classification improved to grade E. Imaging data showed that the ossification of the thoracic vertebrae had subsided, while the volume of the local spinal canal had recovered and the spinal cord injury had been completely relieved. No adverse effects or complications were observed. Conclusions: The lamina-lifting suspension system preserves the benefits of bridge crane technique while also augmenting the traction of a post laminae-OLF complex (LOC) suspension, rendering it more secure and manageable. Nevertheless, further sample analysis and research are required in the future.

Materials and methods Three-dimensional computed tomography data of 100 ABC fractures treated at our hospital from August 2016 to August 2019 were retrospectively analyzed using Mimics and 3-matic software. The distribution of fracture lines was described using the fracture mapping technique. Results One fragment presented on the QP was confirmed in 88% of the patients. The QP fragments' fracture lines were divided into the anterior oblique (AO), superior posterior oblique (SPO), and mid-posterior oblique (MPO) lines, occurring in 100, 86, and 8 cases, respectively. AO lines were distributed along the arcuate line. SPO lines were continuations of the AO lines, which were distributed to the posterior column from the greater sciatic notch to the lesser sciatic notch. MPO lines were involved in the QP's central area. A simple fracture was found at the proximal AO and SPO lines in 80% and 86% of all displaced fractures, respectively. AO lines distal to the superior rim of the acetabula were confirmed to be comminuted fractures in 32% of all cases. Conclusions In ABC fractures, there was only one QP fragment in nearly 90% of all cases. The QP fractures were mainly present in the QP's peripheral area. More than 80% of the fracture patterns on the cephalic side of the QP were simple. The reduction and internal fixation of QP fractures in ABC fractures should be in the cephalic region.

Coronal fracture lines are associated with a high risk of fixation failure. However, previous biomechanical studies and fracture classifications have disregarded coronal fracture lines. Materials and methods This study aimed to develop a clinically relevant fracture model (Fracture C) and compare its mechanical behavior with the traditional Horwitz model (Fracture H). Twelve samples of fourth-generation tibia Sawbones were utilized to realize two fracture models with (Fracture C) or without (Fracture H) a coronal fracture line and both fixed with lateral locking plates. Loading of the tibial plateau was introduced through artificial femur condyles to cyclically load the fracture constructs until failure. Stiffness, fracture gap movements, failure loads as well as relative displacements and rotations of fracture fragments were measured. Results The presence of a coronal fracture line reduced fracture construct stiffness by 43% (p = 0.013) and decreased the failure load by 38% from 593 +/- 159 to 368 +/- 63 N (p = 0.016). Largest displacements were observed at the medial aspect between the tibial plateau and the tibial shaft in the longitudinal direction. Again, the presence of the coronal fracture line reduced the stability of the fragments and created increased joint incongruities. Conclusions Coronal articular fracture lines substantially affect the mechanical response of tibia implant structures specifically on the medial side. With this in mind, utilizing a clinically relevant fracture model for biomechanical evaluations regarding bi-condylar tibial plateau fractures is strongly recommended.

The aim of this study was to identify patients with EGFR mutations using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue and fresh tissue (FT). Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective study using 13 cases of FFPE lung adenocarcinoma, and a prospective study using seven fresh samples of lung carcinomas (FT), collected by intraoperative dissection of the tumors. Using the DNA extracted from the FFPE tissue and FT, we attempted to identify deletions of exon 19 and point mutations of exon 21, according to the allele-specific PCR method described by Dahse et al. (2008). Results: In all seven cases of FT (three adenocarcinomas, three squamous carcinomas, one large-cell carcinoma), we identified the wild type allele and the internal control in case of exon 19, and the wild type allele for exon 21, but not the mutated alleles. Considering that no standard method for formalin fixation and paraffin embedding has been implemented at the Laboratory of Pathology, the DNA extracted from these samples became fragmented and damaged, which compromised the results of PCR testing aimed at the detection of EGFR mutations. Conclusions: The presented method can be implemented at our laboratory to identify these mutations from fresh tissue collected during surgical resection. Additionally, standardization of formalin fixation and paraffin embedding of surgical samples is required, in order the enable subsequent processing using molecular biology methods.

SURFACE POLISHING POSITIVELY INFLUENCES EASE OF PLATE AND SCREW REMOVAL	EUROPEAN CELLS & MATERIALS			English	Article						Implant removal; in vivo; locking compression plate; screw removal; commercially pure titanium; titanium-6%aluminium-7% niobium	CAPITAL FEMORAL EPIPHYSIS; STAINLESS-STEEL; MINIPLATE REMOVAL; INTERNAL-FIXATION; IMPLANT REMOVAL; FOLLOW-UP; TITANIUM; SURGERY; TRAUMA; BONE	Difficulties removing temporary fracture fixation devices due to excessive bony on-growth results in extended surgical time leading to excessive blood loss, debris contamination and potentially refracture. Commercially available locking plates and screws are manufactured for clinics with a micro-rough surface, which contributes to the excessive bony on-growth reported. We have applied polishing technology to commercially pure titanium locking compression plates (LCP) and titanium-6%aluminium-7% niobium (TAN) plates and screws to assess if it can alleviate problems with strong bony overgrowth. Samples were implanted for 6, 12 and 18 months in a bilateral sheep tibia non fracture model and assessed for screw removal torque, percentage of bone contact and tissue-material response. Both electropolishing (p=0.001) and paste polishing (p=0.010) of TAN screws significantly reduced the mean torque required for removal compared to their micro-rough counterparts. This was accompanied by a trend for a lower percentage of bone contact for polished screws. This difference in bone contact was significant for paste polished TAN screws (p<0.001) but not electropolished TAN screws (p=0.066). Ex vivo, soft tissue removal was much easier (similar to five minutes) for polished constructs, which was difficult and at least four times longer for standard micro-rough constructs. We suggest that polishing of locked plate/screw systems will improve ease of removal and reduce implant related removal complications encountered due to excessive strong bony on-growth while maintaining biocompatibility and implant stability. Future studies aim to assess the potential of this technology in the next level of complication, a fracture model.	[Richards, R. G.] AO Fdn, AO Res Inst Davos, CH-7270 Davos, Switzerland; [Hayes, J.

It is potentially serious, and treatment is controversial. Several studies assessed prognostic factors, only one of which used exclusive intramedullary nailing, despite this being the gold standard. Hypothesis: Open surgery provides poor functional results in radial neck fracture. Material and method: All patients undergoing reduction and internal fixation of radial neck fracture between 2005 and 2015 were analysed. Inclusion criteria comprised Jeffery type 1 fracture with open growth plate, complete file, and >= 1 year's follow-up. Treatment systematically comprised Metaizeau intramedullary nailing, with crossover to open reduction only in case of failure. Good results were defined as full range of motion and pain-free elbow. Results: Fifty-six patients were included: 33 girls, 23 boys; mean age, 9 years. On the Judet classification modified by Metaizeau, 4 fractures were grade 2, 29 grade 3, 15 grade 4A and 8 grade 4B. Closed reduction was performed in 48 cases, including 8 with the help of percutaneous leverage effect. Eight required a surgical approach. Twenty-three showed postoperative reduction defect. At a mean 74 months' follow-up, at a mean age of 15 years, 37 patients had reached full skeletal maturity. Sixteen had poor results. Open reduction was associated with poor outcome (p < 0.01). Age, initial epiphyseal tilt, associated lesions, immobilisation time, time to nail removal and residual tilt after reduction did not significantly affect outcome (p-values > 0.05). Percutaneous leverage effect had no impact on the quality of results (p = 1). Discussion: Open reduction is to be avoided in radial neck fracture. A prospective study is needed to assess remodelling potential according to age. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

The aim of the study was to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and functional outcome after treatment of four-part fractures of proximal humerus with Multiloc proximal humeral nail. Design: prospective monocentric cohort study. Setting: single level 1 traumacenter. Materials and Methods: From February 2011 to March 2016, 40 patients with displaced four-part proximal humeral fractures were treated with intramedullary nail inserted through anterolateral approach. Minimum one year follow up completed 35 patients and were involved into the study. Results: After mean follow up period of 25.8 months 29 of 35 fractures healed. Average absolute Constant score in all 35 patients reached 57.7 points, relative side related Constants score 66.8% of contralateral extremity. Together there were 20 complications. in 6 cases (17%) developed complete avascular necrosis of the head. One deep infection was treated by implantation of antibiotic cement discs. Twelve secondary surgeries were performed, mostly for avascular necrosis development. Function and pain were significantly influenced by the quality of fracture reduction (p < 0.05) and development of complete AVN (p = 0.001). Group of 29 patients without AVN reached relative Constant score 73% of contralateral extremity. Conclusions: Intramedullary nailing can be used as possible fixation technique for the treatment of four-part fractures of proximal humerus. In experienced hands provides nailing osteosynthesis similar results as reconstruction with locking plates. Appropriate reduction of fracture fragments is the key for good functional result.

Improving Postoperative Nasal Airway Patency in Le Fort-Based, Maxillofacial Trauma Patients Via a Modified Nasal Packing Technique	JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article						Airway; intermaxillary fixation; Le Fort; nasal bone fracture; nasal packing; respiration	MANAGEMENT; COMPLICATIONS; INTUBATION	Introduction: Combined mid-face and nasal apparatus trauma injuries pose a significant challenge to airway patency (AW), in the immediate postoperative setting following fracture reduction. As such, the authors describe a modified technique with the goal of maintaining a patent nasal AW, while at the same time, minimizing nasopharyngeal bleeding and nasal AW edema-which can complicate patients requiring intermaxillary fixation (IMF) in the setting of pan-facial trauma. Methods: Amodified technique was devised to assist the reconstruction surgeon in avoiding the risks associated with tracheostomy placement. In an effort to avoid surgical AW complications and improve nasal AW patency in the setting of concurrent IMF and nasal trauma, the authors developed a 2-stage technique drawing upon knowledge from the literature and the authors' own experiences. Technique: Following safe extubation, the authors insert open lumen nasal splints in both the nostrils, and suture them together to the nasal septum. If additional inner nasal support is required, polyvinyl alcohol nonabsorbable nasal packing dressing is covered with antibiotic ointment, and then placed within the nasal cavity lateral to the open lumen splints-as a way to further bolster the internal valve and mid-vault anatomy. Discussion: Given the fact that traditional nasal packing with merocele/gauze dressing in concomitant to IMF reduced patients ability to ventilate, the authors felt that a modified technique should be applied. The authors' preferred materials in such patients are open lumen splint, which provides nasal AW patency along with some septum support accompanied by merocele dressing. The authors feel that by applying this technique they achieve dual objectives by supporting the traumatized nose and maintaining nasal AW patency.

Materials and Methods: Based on the reconstructed geometry from computed tomography scans of dry adult skull with a mandibular deformity requiring surgical correction, we developed 3-dimensional FE models that simulate BSSRO with 2 different techniques to stabilize the osteotomy. Technique 1 uses 3 bicortical titanium screws. Technique 2 uses a curved titanium plate with 4 monocortical screws. Five different load cases were applied to the mandible after the simulated BSSRO with the mandible being constrained at both temporomandibular joints. To evaluate the efficacy of these 2 stabilization techniques, we compared 1) the resulting deflections at the central incisor, 2) the mechanical stresses developed in the bone in the vicinity of the stabilizing implants, and 3) the mechanical stresses developed within the screw/plating system themselves. Results: Technique 1, using 3 bicortical titanium screws, leads to smaller deflections at the central incisor for all 5 load cases, suggesting higher mechanical stability. Technique I also leads to lower mechanical stresses in the bone and in the implanted screws, whereas technique 2 is associated with higher values in each of these quantities. Conclusions: To stabilize osteotomies after a 3-dimensional simulated BSSRO, 3 bicortical screws forming an inverted-L configuration are shown to offer more effective load transmission in the mandibular construct. This technique, when examined in an FE model, leads to higher stability with lower mechanical stresses in the bone near the bicortical screws.

We investigated the effect of a low-rigidity (Ti-24Nb-4Zr-7.9Sn) intramedullary nail regarding stress shielding and bone healing of osteoporotic fractures in the rat. Methods 40 female Sprague-Dawley rats, aged 3 months, were divided into the following groups: sham-operation (SHAM) (n = 10), ovariectomized (OVX) (n = 10) and OVX-fracture (n = 20). 10 SHAM rats and 10 OVX rats were killed after 12 weeks to provide biomechanical data. Ovariectomy was performed 12 weeks before fracturing both femurs in 20 rats. The left fracture was stabilized with a high-rigidity titanium alloy pin (Ti-6Al-4V; elastic modulus 110 GPa) and the right with a low-rigidity (Ti-24Nb-4Zr-7.9Sn; elastic modulus 33 GPa). The bony calluses were examined by micro-CT at 6 and 12 weeks after fracture, bone volume (BV) and total volume (TV) were determined at the callus region (ROI1) and the total femur (ROI2). Subsequently, the bones were tested mechanically by a three-point bending test. Results In the low-rigidity group, TV (ROI1) increased at 6 weeks, but BV (ROI1), BV (ROI2) were similar but maximum load increased. At 12 weeks, the maximum load and also BV (ROI1, ROI2) were increased in the low-rigidity group. Interpretation The low-rigidity nail manufactured from Ti-24Nb-4Zr-7.9Sn showed better external callus formation, seemed to reduce effects of stress shielding, and reduced bone resorption better than the stiffer nail. The low-rigidity nail was strong enough to maintain alignment of the fracture in the osteoporotic rat model without delayed union.

Stainless steel and commercially pure titanium are widely used materials in orthopedic implants. However, it is still being controversially discussed whether there are significant differences in tissue reaction and metallic release, which should result in a recommendation for preferred use in clinical practice. Materials and methods. A comparative study was performed using 14 stainless steel and 8 commercially pure titanium plates retrieved after a 12-month implantation period. To avoid contamination of the tissue with the elements under investigation, surgical instruments made of zirconium dioxide were used. The tissue samples were analyzed histologically and by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) for accumulation of the metals Fe, Cr, Mo, Ni, and Ti in the local tissues. Implant corrosion was determined by the use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results: With grades 2 or higher in 9 implants, steel plates revealed a higher extent of corrosion in the SEM compared with titanium, where only one implant showed corrosion grade 2. Metal uptake of all measured ions (Fe, Cr, Mo, Ni) was significantly increased after stainless steel implantation, whereas titanium revealed only high concentrations for Ti. For the two implant materials, a different distribution of the accumulated metals was found by histological examination. Whereas specimens after steel implantation revealed a diffuse siderosis of connective tissue cells, those after titanium exhibited occasionally a focal siderosis due to implantation-associated bleeding. Neither titanium- nor stainless steel-loaded tissues revealed any signs of foreign-body reaction. Conclusion: We conclude from the increased release of toxic, allergic, and potentially carcinogenic ions adjacent to stainless steel that commercially pure Ti should be treated as the preferred material for osteosyntheses if a removal of the implant is not intended. However, neither material provoked a foreign-body reaction in the local tissues, thus cpTi cannot be recommend as the 'golden standard' for osteosynthesis material in general.

Pedicle screws implantation in polymethylmethacrylate construct to stabilise sixth lumbar vertebral body fracture in dogs: 5 cases (2015-2018)	JOURNAL OF SMALL ANIMAL PRACTICE			English	Article							COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; INTERNAL-FIXATION; ROD FIXATION; LUXATIONS; METHYLMETHACRYLATE; INSTRUMENTATION; ACCURACY; SPINE; PINS; LAMINECTOMY	Objectives To assess the feasibility and outcome of pedicle screw implantation on sixth lumbar vertebral body fractures. Materials and Methods Dogs with sixth lumbar vertebral body fractures stabilised using L6 and L7 (+/- L5) pedicular implantation via a dorsal approach preferentially and conventional vertebral body implantation otherwise were reviewed. Coaptation was made with bone cement. Complete neurological examination, pre and postoperative imaging consistent with L6 body fracture (radiographs +/- CT scan) and follow up including clinical examination and radiographs 3 to 5 weeks post-operatively were required as inclusion criteria. When available, owner interview and/or clinical examination and imaging (radiographs +/- CT scan) at least 1 year after surgery were reported. Results Five dogs met the inclusion criteria. Dorsal pedicle screws implantation was feasible in all L7 vertebrae and in four L6 vertebrae. Adequate implantation was observed in all of the post-operative radiographs and on all of the three CT scans available. At 3 to 6 weeks after surgery, neurological status and locomotion were normal in four dogs, while one dog suffering from severe sciatic neuropathy did not regain normal locomotion. At least 1 year after surgery, clinical outcome was excellent for four dogs and imaging by radiography and CT scan were available for three dogs and showed complete healing of the fracture and correct positioning of the implants. The dog suffering from sciatic neuropathy had a further trauma and was euthanased 7 weeks after the surgery. Clinical Significance In this case series, pedicle screw implantation achieved stabilisation of L6 vertebral body fractures, with full recovery observed in four out of five dogs. Further studies are required to confirm the safety and the effectiveness of this intervention.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the technical feasibility of CT- and fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous vertebroplasty in the treatment of vertebral split fractures. Materials and methods: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained for this study. Sixty-two consecutive adult patients who had post-traumatic vertebral split fractures (A2 according to the AO classification) without neurological symptoms were prospectively treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty. All these procedures were performed by an interventional radiologist under computed tomography (CT) and fluoroscopy guidance by using only local anaesthesia. Postoperative outcome was assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) scores. Results: Vertebroplasty was performed on thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, creating a cement bridge between the displaced fragment and the rest of the vertebral body. Seven discal cement leakages (11%) were observed, without occurrence of adjacent vertebral compression fractures. The mean VAS measurements +/- standard deviation (SD) significantly decreased from 7.9 +/- 1.5 preoperatively to 3.3 +/- 2.1 at 1 day, 2.2 +/- 2.0 at 1 month, and 1.8 +/- 1.4 at 6 months (P < 0.001). The mean ODI scores +/- SD had also a significant improvement: 62.3 +/- 17.2 preoperatively and 15.1 +/- 6.0 at the 6-month follow-up (P < 0.001). Conclusion: This study suggests that type A2 vertebral fractures could be successfully treated by CT- and fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous vertebroplasty. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Material and Methods: Patients treated at the Oral and Maxillofacial Department of Dicle University during a five-year period between 2000 and 2005 were retrospectively evaluated with respect to age groups, gender, etiology, localization and type of fractures, treatment methods and complications. Result: 532 patients were included in the study, 370 (70%) males and 162 (30%) females, with a total of 744 mandibular fractures. The mean age of young patients was 10, with a male-female ratio of 2:1. The mean age of adult patients was 28, with a male-female ratio of 3: 1. The most common causes of injury were falls (65%) in young patients and traffic accidents (38%) in adults. The most common fracture sites were the symphysis (35%) and condyle (36%) in young patients, and the symphysis in adults (36%). Mandibular fractures were generally treated by arch bar and maxillomandibular fixation in both young (67%) and adult (39%) patients, and 43% of the adult patients were treated by open reduction and internal fixation. Conclusion: There was a similar gender, monthly and type of treatment distribution in both young and adult patients in the southeast region of Turkey. However, there were differences regarding age, etiology and fracture site. These findings between young and adult patients are broadly similar to those from other studies. Analysis of small differences may be an important factor in assessing educational and socioeconomic environments.

We report an original technique based on a mechanical concept with a structural principle of a triangle as a rigid body applied to the humeral head fractures in association with other devices. This retrospective study aims to describe in detail the surgical technique and results at long time follow up. Methods and Material: We analysed two series of 101 patients with proximal humeral fractures (mean age, 52.9 y; range 19-78 y) treated between 2001 and 2012 reporting the clinical and radiological results. In the first series of 23 cases (mean age 51.4 y, range 35-74 y) we used as support a bone piece taken from allograft or autologous tricortical iliac crest and shaped as a triangular pyramid during the operation; while in the second series of 78 cases (mean age 53.6 years, range 29-78 years, SD 13.5 years) a triangular titanium cage was used in 69 patients while in 9 allograft or bone substitute was used as augmentation. An analytical retrospective study was done to understand the mechanical function of medial augmentation composed by a solid body in association with different types of synthesis to stabilize properly a proximal humeral fracture. Results: We obtained excellent and good results in 83,2% of patients, fair in 12,8% and bad in 4% in terms of active anterior elevation, external and internal rotation, pain and strength according to Constant and DASH score. Conclusion: A medial solid body, especially in titanium material and shaped as trapezoidal/pyramidal form used to fill the secondary bone loss in complex instable proximal humeral fracture, allows an anatomic reduction and stable fixation in association with simple and more complex tools and it provides a better biomechanical environment for union and maintenance of alignment.

The technical approach was chosen to overcome the shortcomings of medically established fabrication processes such as a limited availability of materials or long manufacturing times. The goal of the work was a successful fabrication of basic implants for defect reconstruction. The underlying vision is the implants' clinic-internal and operation-accompanying application. Following a literature search, a material selection was conducted. Digitally prepared three-dimensional (3D) models dealing with two representative mandible bone defects were printed based on the material selection. An ex-vivo model of the implant environment evaluated dimensional and fitting traits of the implants. Glycol-modified PET (PETG) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) were finally selected. These plastics had high cell acceptance, good mechanical properties, and optimal printability. The subsequent fabrication process yielded two different implant strategies: the standard implant made of PETG with a build-up rate of approximately 10 g/h, and the biofunctional performance implant with a TPU shell and a PETG core with a build-up rate of approximately 4 g/h. The standard implant is meant to be intraoperatively applied, as the print time is below three hours even for larger skull defects. Standard implants proved to be well fitting, mechanically stable and cleanly printed. In addition, the hybrid implant showed particularly cell-friendly behavior due to the chemical constitution of the TPU shell and great impact stability because of the crack-absorbing TPU/PETG combination. This biofunctional constellation could be used in specific reconstructive patient cases and is suitable for pre-operative manufacturing based on radiological image scans of the defect. In summary, filament-based material extrusion has been identified as a suitable manufacturing method for personalized implants in the maxillofacial area. A further clinical and mechanical study is recommended.

No standard test methods have been adopted for these tests and the impact of test setup on inferred construct mechanics has not been reported. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to use finite element models to compare the mechanical performance of a supracondylar osteotomy with lateral plating under conditions that replicate several common bench test methods. A literature review was used to define a parameterized virtual model of a plated distal femur osteotomy in axial compression loading with four boundary condition sets ranging from minimally to highly constrained. Axial stiffness, fracture gap closure, and transverse motion at the fracture line were recorded for a range of applied loads and bridge spans. The results showed that construct mechanical performance was highly sensitive to boundary conditions imposed by the mechanical test fixtures. Increasing the degrees of constraint, for example, by potting and rigidly clamping one or more ends of the specimen, caused up to a 25 x increase in axial stiffness of the construct. Transverse motion and gap closure at the fracture line, which is an important driver of interfragmentary strain, was also largely influenced by the constraint test setup. These results suggest that caution should be used when comparing reported results between bench tests that use different fixtures and that standardization of testing methods is needed in this field.

Material and methods: Sixty patients with mandibular angle fracture were analyzed regarding their operative treatment: 30 patients were treated with an external oblique plate and compared to 30 patients treated with a grid plate on the vestibular cortex. The follow up period was at least 1 year for both groups and the following complications were noted: infection, abnormality in fracture healing, nonunion, pain, hypoaesthesia and dysocclusion. Results: The overall average operation time (from intubation to extubation) was 102.1 min (+/- 44.1 mm). Single sided fractures treated with the grid plate needed in average 81.07 min (+/- 37.9 min) of operation time while single sided fractures treated with the external oblique plate needed 89.3 min (+/- 2.2 min). In multiple mandibular fractures, no significant change in the operation time between either plating system was found (118.8 +/- 35.2 min). After the follow up period fracture healing was considered clinically complete in all patients, but complications occurred significantly more often in the external oblique group (13.3%; N = 8) than in the grid plate group (0%; N = 0). Conclusion: Isolated mandibular angle fractures can be more effectively treated using grid plates than using other osteosynthesis techniques. It is an easy to use alternative to conventional miniplate systems with good clinical outcome and fewer complications. An angulated burr and screwdriver has to be used to put on the plate laterally.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate fusion rates, risk of reoperation, postoperative pain scores and patient satisfaction for a slot graft inlay arthrodesis technique used in a high-risk group of foot and ankle patients. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all ankle, hindfoot and midfoot arthrodeses by two foot and ankle surgeons in our institution between January 2000 and January 2009. Seventeen arthrodesis procedures in 16 patients using the slot graft technique were identified. Patient charts were reviewed for medical history, risk factors, previous surgery and postoperative complications. Time to union was evaluated on radiographs. Patients provided final followup by phone with an assessment of pain, overall satisfaction and use of orthotic or assistive devices. Results: Union occurred in 13 arthrodesis procedures (77%) with an average time to union of 5 months. Postoperative infection occurred in one patient. Additional surgery was performed in nine patients. At final followup patients reported low pain scores (3 of 10) and high satisfaction (8 of 10). Fourteen of 15 patients contacted indicated that they would choose to undergo the procedure again. Conclusion: The slot graft arthrodesis technique provided satisfactory results in this small group of patients with a low complication rate. Patient satisfaction rates were high with low pain scores at an average of 62 months postoperatively.

Owing to numerous disadvantages, bioresorbable materials are preferred over titanium for osteofixation in certain procedures. The biomaterials used for osteosynthesis in maxillofacial surgery have been subdivided into four generations. No study has compared the tissue responses generated by four generations of biomaterials and the feasibility of using these biomaterials in different maxillofacial surgeries. We conducted an in vivo animal study to evaluate host tissue response to four generations of implanted biomaterial sheets, namely, PLLA, PLLA/PGA, u-HA/PLLA, and u-HA/PLLA/PGA. New bone volume and pertinent biomarkers for bone regeneration, such as Runx2, osteocalcin (OCN), and the inflammatory marker CD68, were analyzed, and the expression of each biomarker was correlated with soft tissues outside the biomaterial and toward the host bone at the end of week 2 and week 10. The use of first-generation biomaterials for maxillofacial osteosynthesis is not advantageous over the use of other updated biomaterials. Second-generation biomaterials degrade faster and can be potentially used in non-stress regions, such as the midface. Third and fourth-generation biomaterials possess bioactive/osteoconductivity improved strength. Application of third-generation biomaterials can be considered panfacially. Fourth-generation biomaterials can be worth considering applying at midface due to the shorter degradation period.

Organic carbonates, especially cyclic carbonates, are applicable as green solvents, electrolytes in batteries, feedstock for fine chemicals and monomers for polycarbonate production. This review summarizes new developments in the ring opening of epoxides with subsequent CO2-based formation of cyclic carbonates. The review highlights recent and major developments for sustainable CO2 conversion from 2000 to the end of 2021 abstracted by Web of Science. The syntheses of epoxides, especially from bio-based raw materials, will be summarized, such as the types of raw material (vegetable oils or their esters) and the reaction conditions. The aim of this review is also to summarize and to compare the types of homogeneous non-metallic catalysts. The three reaction mechanisms for cyclic carbonate formation are presented, namely activation of the epoxide ring, CO2 activation and dual activation. Usually most effective catalysts described in the literature consist of powerful sources of nucleophile such as onium salt, of hydrogen bond donors and of tertiary amines used to combine epoxide activation for facile epoxide ring opening and CO2 activation for the subsequent smooth addition reaction and ring closure. The most active catalytic systems are capable of activating even internal epoxides such as epoxidized unsaturated fatty acid derivatives for the cycloaddition of CO2 under relatively mild conditions. In case of terminal epoxides such as epichlorohydrin, the effective utilization of diluted sources of CO2 such as flue gas is possible using the most active organocatalysts even at ambient pressure.

In large mandibular advancements insufficient healing at the mandibular inferior border may lead to loss of support for the overlaying tissue at the osteotomy site. Augmentation can be performed to improve stability, bone regeneration, and the aesthetic outcome. The purpose of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate the use of a novel material for this indication; granules of the anti-bacterial, osteoconductive, and slowly resorbing bioactive glass S53P4 as filling material in large mandibular advancement in bilateral sagittal split osteotomies. The authors treated 25 patients who underwent bilateral sagittal split osteotomies due to class II dentoskeletal deformities. The mandibular osteotomy site defects (8-15 mm) were augmented with bioactive glass S53P4. The average clinical follow-up was 33 months and the average radiological follow-up with cone beam computerized tomography was 24 months. The clinical and radiological results were good with regard to healing, bone regeneration, and stability of the osteotomy sites. The recontouring of the inferior mandibular border provided a good soft tissue support followed by an excellent aesthetic outcome in 96% of the osteotomy sites. The occlusion was stable in 88% of the patients. The authors' results show that bioactive glass S53P4 is a safe grafting material for osteotomy site defects in significant mandibular advancements with reliable bone regeneration, providing long-term stability at the osteotomy site and at the inferior mandibular border.

However, its fast degradation in physio-logical media is considered as a significant challenge for its successful clinical applications. Bioactive reinforcements containing Mg-based composites constitute one of the promising approaches for developing degradable metallic implants because of their adjustable mechanical behaviors, corrosion resistance, and biological response. Strontium is a trace element known for its role in enhancing osteoblast activity. In this study, bioactive SrO-doped magnesium phosphate (MgP)-reinforced Mg composites containing 1, 3, and 5 wt % MgP were developed through the casting route. The influence of the SrO-doped MgP reinforcement on degradation behaviors of the composites along with its cell-material interactions and in vivo biocompatibility was investigated. The wt % and distribution of MgP particles significantly improved the mechanical properties of the composite. HBSS immersion study indicated the least corrosion rate (0.56 +/- 0.038 mmpy) for the Mg-3MgP composite. The higher corrosion resistance of Mg-3MgP leads to a controlled release of Sr-containing bioactive reinforcement, which eventually enhanced the cytotoxicity as measured using MG-63 cell-material interactions. The in vivo biocompatibility of the composite was evaluated using the rabbit femur defect model. Micro-computed tomography (mu-CT) and histological analysis supported the fact that Mg-3MgP maintained its structural integrity and enhanced osteogenesis (50.36 +/- 2.03%) after 2 months of implantation. The results indicated that the Mg-MgP composite could be used as a degradable internal fracture fixation device material.

By far, LCP is the most traditionally used implant plate (using non-biodegradable material) because of its experimental success, but not with qualified biodegradable material (Mg-alloy). This lack of mechanical performance is a major drawback that can be rectified by better structural design. This will help avoid few other problems as well. Therefore, with proper consideration, the LCP has been added to a semicircular filleted longitudinally centered embossed (LCE) structure to enhance overall mechanical performance that can help emphasize mechanical support even after continuous degradation when applied in a physiological environment. For mechanical verification of this advanced design of biodegradable bone implant plate, four-point bending test (4PBT) and axial compression test (ACT) have been performed using FEM on LCELCP, LCP, continuously degraded (CD)-LCELCP, and CD-LCP. LCELCP showed reduced stress of about 22% and 10% in 4PBT and ACT, respectively, compared to LCP. CD-LCELCP is safe during ACT over 6 months of continuous degradation when the degradation rate is assumed to be 4 mm/year. These results also ensured accuracy using mesh convergence and also mesh checked for quality assurance. Overall, LCELCP can be considered as a biodegradable bone implant plate because of its superior performance, if its ultimate validation is carried out through animal/human trials as future work.

Negative pressure wound therapy for seroma prevention and surgical incision treatment in spinal fracture care	INTERNATIONAL WOUND JOURNAL			English	Article						NPWT; Spinal fracture; Wound complication; Wound healing	VACUUM-ASSISTED CLOSURE; MANAGEMENT; TRAUMA; DEFECT; BONE	To evaluate the clinical use and economic aspects of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) after dorsal stabilisation of spinal fractures. This study is a prospective randomised evaluation of NPWT in patients with large surgical wounds after surgical stabilisation of spinal fractures by internal fixation. Patients were randomised to either standard wound dressing treatment (group A) or NPWT (group B). The wound area was examined by ultrasound to measure seroma volumes in both groups on the 5th and 10th day after surgery. Furthermore, data on economic aspects such as nursing time for wound care and material used for wound dressing were evaluated. A total of 20 patients (10 in each group) were enrolled. Throughout the whole study, mean seroma volume was significantly higher in group A than that in group B (day 5: 1<bold></bold>9 ml versus 0 ml; P = 0<bold></bold>0007; day 10: 1<bold></bold>6 ml versus 0<bold></bold>5 ml; P <0<bold></bold>024). Furthermore, patients of group A required more wound care time (group A: 31 +/- 10 minutes; group B 13<bold></bold>8 +/- 6 minutes; P = 0<bold></bold>0005) and more number of compresses (total number; group A 35 +/- 15; group B 11 +/- 3; P = 0<bold></bold>0376). NPWT reduced the development of postoperative seroma, reduced nursing time and reduced material required for wound care.

Pediatric Facial Fractures as a Result of Gunshot Injuries: An Examination of Associated Injuries and Trends in Management	JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article						orbital fractures; mandibular fractures; maxillary fractures; skull fractures; zygomatic fractures; pediatrics; wounds; gunshot	SHOTGUN WOUNDS; RIGID FIXATION; FACE; RECONSTRUCTION; BONE; GROWTH; TRAUMA; HEAD	Introduction Facial fractures are relatively uncommon in the pediatric population, especially those inflicted as a result of interpersonal violence in the form of gunshot injuries. Few studies have examined the unique management of such high-energy injuries in the pediatric population. Oftentimes the resultant damage to soft tissue and bony structures is so great that it challenges the previously accepted standards in the management of pediatric facial fractures. This study will examine a level 1 trauma center's experience with these unique injuries. Methods A retrospective review of all facial fractures occurring in a pediatric population (those 18 years of age or younger) as a result of gunshot wounds in a level 1 trauma center in an urban environment was performed for the years 2000 to 2012. Descriptive information was collected regarding each case as well as information regarding concomitant injuries, treatment modalities, and selected outcomes. Results During this time period, there were 3147 facial fractures treated at our institution, 353 of which were in pediatric patients. Of these, 17 were the results of gunshot wounds. Three patients were excluded due to insufficient data, leaving a total of 14 patients. The average age of patients was 16.5 (range 14-18); all patients were African-American males. The most common fracture was that of the mandible (n = 10), with 2 of those patients exhibiting panfacial fractures. The average Glasgow Coma Scale on admission was 13.5 (range 3-15). Six of the patients were intubated in the emergency department. The most common concomitant injury was a skull fracture (n = 3), followed by cervical spine fractures (n = 2) and intracranial hemorrhages (n = 2). All patients were admitted to the hospital for reasons other than fracture management. Seven patients ultimately went to the operating room for fracture management. The treatment modalities employed were conservative management with closed techniques (n = 11), rigid internal fixation (n = 2), and the use of an external fixator device (n = 1). Minimal to no soft-tissue debridement was performed in 10 of the 14 patients, 2 of which presented between 6 months and 10 years post-injury with soft-tissue complications related to retained material. The mean hospital length of stay was 8.2 days (range 1-18 days). One patient expired. Discussion Pediatric facial fractures as a result of gunshot wounds represent a unique and fortunately rare entity that presents a challenge to all disciplines involved in treatment. In our patients, there was a tendency towards conservative management, with only 3 patients undergoing some form of fixation and only 7 undergoing some form of operative debridement. Concomitant injuries and the high-energy nature of gunshot wounds often preclude traditional management with rigid fixation to ensure adequate bony healing. However, it is important to adequately debride devitalized soft tissue and remove all foreign material to avoid future soft tissue-related complications.

The adhesion, spread, and growth states of cells on each group of sample were analyzed according to SEM images. The fluorescent micromorphology was analyzed, and the relative growth ratio was calculated to quantitatively evaluate the influence of these extracts on the cell viability. Results displayed that moderate and severe cytotoxicity appeared after cells incubated with extracts of Mg-2Zn rod for 3 and 5 days, but it returned to normal phenomenon after the extracts diluted by 10 times. Extracts of other three groups of sample displayed good cytocompatibility. The growth and proliferation of cells were closely related to the pH value and concentration of Mg2+. The osmolality changes of extracts had little influence on cytocompatibility of samples at the early stage. Therefore, we can predict the effect of degradation products of Mg wire/PLA composites on their cytocompatibility during the degradation process, on the basis of pH value, concentration of Mg2+, as well as osmolality changes. The good cytocompatibility of Mg wire/PLA composites provided experimental valid and valuable guideline for further material design and scheme selection.

These OM (BioSorb, LactoSorb, and Delta) were used in 64 patients of whom 55 (85.9%) had fractures of the zygoma, five (7.8%) in the LeFort II level, two of the frontal bone (3.1%), and two of the maxillary sinus wall (3.1%). In addition to routine follow-up (FU) at 3, 6, and 12 months (m) (T1, T2, and T3) all patients were finally evaluated at a mean FU after 14.1 m for minor (e.g., nerve disturbances, swelling, and pain) and major (e.g., infections and occlusal disturbances) complications. Out of all 64 patients 38 presented with complications; of these 28 were minor (43.8%) and 10 major (15.6%) resulting in an overall rate of 59.4%. Differences in minor complications regarding sensibility disturbance at T1 and T3 were statistically significant (P = 0.04). Differences between the OM were not statistically significant. Apart from sufficient mechanical stability for clinical use of all tested OM complications mostly involved pain and swelling probably mainly related to the initial bulk reaction attributable to the drop of pH value during the degradation process. This paper includes a review of the current aspects of biodegradable OM.

A certain broadening of the dielectric permittivity peak is observed for the films on the silicon substrate after a year keeping without external actions. The lead titanate films on corundum substrates did not demonstrate visible changes in structural and dielectric parameters in the course of this time. In the course of repeated cycling the reduction of switching polarization in the lead titanate and lead zirconate titanate films on silicon substrates takes place at considerably greater number of cycles as compared to the same films on corundum substrates under the identical conditions. The above changes of dielectric and switching characteristics can be relevant to the changes in the domain structure of the materials under investigation in the process of their ageing and repeated switching. The reason for the acceleration of the ageing processes in the films on corundum substrates could be either an increase in the absolute magnitude of the switching field or an increase of the internal bias field, that facilitate the migration of oxygen vacancies in the films with the perovskite structure to the electrode-ferroelectric surface with the consequent fixation of domain walls.

This new displacement transducer consists of two anchorage plates for the fixation of displacement sensor in soil, a single FBG sensor for sensing the occurred deformation, and a PolyVinyl Chloride (PVC) tube for the protection of inner FBG sensor. The two anchorage plates were fabricated and fixed on the PVC tube surface by FDM process. Gauge length, maximum measurement displacement, and displacement resolution of the proposed FBG displacement transducer were 90 mm, 0.9 mm, and 0.0747 mm, respectively. Raw material of the anchorage plates was Polylactic Acid (PLA) material. An embankment model was established and installed with multiplexed four FBG displacement transducers for the measurement of internal horizontal displacement in laboratory. Both static load and movable load were applied on the top surface of the embankment model. It is found that maximum error of the four sensors under different static load was less than 6%. The monitored strains of four different FBG displacement transducers under movable load were highly consistent, indicating that the smart FBG based small deformation monitoring system can be used to monitor vehicle flow in future. All monitored displacement values were less than 0.03 mm. Therefore the FBG displacement transducer characterized by high resolution can be used to monitor small displacement occurred underground.

Material and methods: The material comprised Sawbones (R) (20 x20 x 50 mm), K-wires (diameter 1.2 mm, 1.5 mm, 1.8 mm; threading 0 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm), a universal chuck with T handle and a drill (speed 0, 320, 500, 830, 1,290 rpm), and tensile testing machine and a digital decision aid. The Sawbones (R) were drilled, varying diameter, threading and speed. The Statistical Design of Experiments (SDOE) methodology enabled the number of trials to be reduced from 300 to 70. Tensile tests at 1 mm/s was imposed on the K-wire up to pullout (pullout strength). Results: There was no interaction between threading length and diameter effects or between drilling speed and diameter effects, but a strong interaction between drilling speed and threading length effects. Conclusion: Before using K-wires for internal fixation in wrist or hand fracture, the surgeon has to select their characteristics, optimal holding power being theoretically ensured by large diameter wires with long threading inserted by a high-speed drill.

In this study, lysine-triisocyanate-based polyurethane (PUR) composites were synthesized from both hydroxyapatite (HA) and beta-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) to reduce the brittleness of CaP and increase the bioactivity of the polymer. The mechanical properties and in vitro cellular response were investigated for both HA/PUR and TCP/PUR composites. The composites were implanted in femoral defects in rats, and in vivo bioactivity was evaluated by X-rays, micro-computed tomography (mu CT), and histological sections. In biomechanical testing, PUR improved the mechanical properties of the CaP, thus rendering it potentially suitable for weight-bearing applications. In vitro cell culture studies showed that CaP/PUR composites are biocompatible, with beta-TCP enhancing the cell viability and proliferation relative to HA. CaP/PUR composites also supported the differentiation of osteoblastic cells on the materials. When implanted in rat femoral defects, the CaP/PUR composites were biocompatible and osteoconductive with no adverse inflammatory response, as evidenced by X-rays, mu CT images, and histological sections. Additionally, a histological examination showed evidence of cellular infiltration and appositional remodeling.

Materials and Methods: Twenty patients with blow-out orbital fracture/orbital floor associated or not with the medial wall were assessed by the same craniofacial surgical group. All were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively by an ophthalmologist for diplopia, enophthalmos, exophthalmos, sensitivity, ophthalmic reflexes, intraocular pressure, and visual field. The patients were subjected to a preoperative facial multislice computed tomographic scan, repeated 6 months after surgery. Eight patients underwent reconstruction with an auricular cartilage graft, and 12 patients, with blade absorbable polyacid copolymer. Subtarsal access was used for all patients. Results: Two patients showed temporary ectropion, 1 in each group. All patients presented satisfactory ocular function, and all tests revealed good orbital delineation, orbital symmetry, periorbital sinus individualization, and reduction of blow-out. Conclusions: The blow-out orbital wall reconstruction can be performed with the use of an auricular cartilage or with a blade absorbable copolymer without differences regarding functional or aesthetic complications and sequelae.

Materials & methods: Bone defects in depressed tibial plateaus were filled with MSC/beta-TCP (n=16) or with beta-TCP only (n=23). Enrichment efficiency and effect of enrichment on cell viability were evaluated. Clinical results were assessed by imaging examination and Lysholm score. Results: SECCS effectively integrated MSCs with beta-TCP. At 18 months postimplantation, new bone ratio was significantly higher in patients treated with MSC/beta-TCP than in those treated with beta-TCP only (p=0.000). Patients with MSC/beta-TCP implants had better functional recovery (p=0.028). Conclusion: MSC/beta-TCP prepared by SECCS were effective in the treatment of bone defects in patients with depressed tibial plateau fractures, promoted bone regeneration and improved joint function recovery.

Although the surgical treatment of ankle fractures is well known, a paucity of literature exists correlating chondral lesions with ankle fracture types. Materials and Methods: This study is a retrospective review of patients with absence or presence of chondral lesions that underwent arthroscopically assisted open reduction and internal fixation between June 2002 and April 2005. There were 38 female and 48 male patients (mean age, 41.4 years; mean followup, 33.9 months), and all had an Ankle-Hindfoot Scale score. The relationship between fracture types and presence of lesions was evaluated. Results: Four of 27 fractures with chondral lesions consisted of the bimalleolar type, 6 of 15 fractures with chondral lesions consisted of the trimalleolar type, and 14 of 20 distal fibula fractures had chondral lesions. There was significant greater incidence of chondral lesions associated with distal fibula fractures. The mean AOFAS score was 95.6 among all fractures. Conclusion: There is clear evidence that despite anatomic reduction, postoperative results of ankle fracture repair are not free of complications. We believe inspection of the talar dome should be routinely considered in the surgical repair ankle fractures.

Interpositional arthroplasty using autogenous costal cartilage graft for temporomandibular joint ankylosis in adults	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article						TMJ ankylosis; autogenous costal; cartilage graft; interpositional arthroplasty; intraoral; approach	TEMPORALIS MYOFASCIAL FLAP; DISC REPLACEMENT; FASCIA FLAP; RECONSTRUCTION; PROSTHESIS; MANAGEMENT; IMPLANT; MUSCLE	This retrospective study evaluated 11 adult patients with TMJ ankylosis treated by interpositional arthroplasty using autogenous costal cartilage grafts between 1985 and 2003. Minimum follow-up was 2 years. Basic personal data, function of TMJ and complications of operation were recorded. Mouth opening increased during operation by a mean of 25.5 mm and postoperatively by a mean of 26.2 mm. The procedure failed in one case with recurrent ankylosis. The remaining 10 cases had final opening ranges in excess of 30 mm. Complications included one numb lower lip. There were no instances of a facial nerve or internal maxillary artery injury. Consideration is given to the width and level of gap arthroplasty, fixation of the grafts, complications at both donor and recipient sites, postoperative physical therapy, occlusal change, and the need for coronoidectomy. This study demonstrated that autogenous costal cartilage is a suitable material for interpositional arthroplasty in adults. Complications were low. The intraoral approach and the role of postoperative physical therapy appear key elements in the success of this procedure.

OBJECTIVE: The whole system encompassed the following three parts: Preprocessing module, finite element mechanical analysis module, post processing module. METHODS: Preprocessing module included parametric modeling of bone, parametric modeling of fracture face, parametric modeling of fixed screw and fixed position and input and transmission of model parameters. Finite element mechanical analysis module included grid division, element type setting, material property setting, contact setting, constraint and load setting, analysis method setting and batch processing operation. Post processing module included extraction and display of batch processing operation results, image generation of batch processing operation, optimal program operation and optimal result display. RESULTS: The system implemented the whole operations from input of fracture parameters to output of the optimal fixed plan according to specific patient real fracture parameter and optimal rules, which demonstrated the effectiveness of the system. CONCLUSIONS: Meanwhile, the system had a friendly interface, simple operation and could improve the system function quickly through modifying single module.

Despite all the published studies, its treatment remains controversial. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the epidemiology and complications of mandibular condyle fractures managed by surgical and conservative treatments, over a period of twenty years. Material and Methods: The files of 262 patients with 318 condyle fractures were included in this study. One hundred and seven patients had conservative management, and 155 had surgical management for the condylar fractures. The outcomes were assessed by reviewing the patient's clinical records. Results: The prevalence was higher in males and most patients were Caucasians in the third decade of life. The mean age was 30.17 years old. The main causes were motorcycle accidents followed by bike accidents, and the mean follow-up time was 226.5 days. The number of complications found in the two modalities of treatment was low and similar. Conclusion: Both treatments achieved their goals. There was no statistical difference in the complication rate between the two groups.

Crystalline ice as a cryoprotectant: theoretical calculation of cooling speed in capillary tubes	JOURNAL OF MICROSCOPY			English	Article						Cryo-fixation; cryo-microscopy; cooling rate; vitrification	HIGH-PRESSURE; POLYMERIC CRYOPROTECTANTS; BIOLOGICAL ULTRASTRUCTURE; ELECTRON-MICROSCOPY; GLASS-TRANSITION; HEAT-CAPACITY; AMORPHOUS ICE; PRESERVATION; WATER; CRYOPRESERVATION	It is generally assumed that vitrification of both cells and the surrounding medium provides the best preservation of ultrastructure of biological material for study by electron microscopy. At the same time it is known that the cell cytoplasm may provide substantial cryoprotection for internal cell structure even when the medium crystallizes. Thus, vitrification of the medium is not essential for good structural preservation. By contrast, a high cooling rate is an essential factor for good cryopreservation because it limits phase separation and movement of cellular components during freezing, thus preserving the native-like state. Here we present calculations of freezing rates that incorporate the effect of medium crystallization, using finite difference methods. We demonstrate that crystallization of the medium in capillary tubes may increase the cooling rate of suspended cells by a factor of 25-300 depending on the distance from the centre. We conclude that crystallization of the medium, for example due to low cryoprotectant content, may actually improve cryopreservation of some samples in a near native state.

The morphological and componential properties of composites were investigated. The carbonate apatite particulates, in sizes of about 50-100 nm, were distributed within the network chitosan hydrogel homogeneously, moreover, inorganic particles could be controlled by the size of networks of organic matrix which was mediated with crosslink degree of chitosan. Through highly magnified TEM observation, it can be shown that inorganic particles were composed of more fine sub-particles whose diameters were between 2 and 5 nm in size without regular crystallographic orientation. The concept of multiple-order template mediation was brought forward for the first time. A novel hierarchical porous nanocomposite scaffold was also prepared by multilevel freeze-drying technique and its mechanical performance had obvious increase compared with neat chitosan. These results provided an efficient approach toward new biomimetic tissue scaffold for the biomedical applications with enhanced intensity/bioactivity and controlled resorption rates.

Although its thermo-responsive shape memory (SM) function has been studied by proper program, high transformation temperature is not suitable in some biomedical applications. Water-responsive SM polymer is an alternative choice and exhibits great potential because it is harmless to the cells and tissues of organisms. In the work, a novel PCL(PMVS-s-PAA)-PCL-PTMG-PCL-(PMVS-s-PAA)-PCL copolymer was devised as an additive to endow PLLA with water-responsive SM capability. The incorporated PLLA was characterized by cross-section, water contact angle, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Inserted PTMG segment and assisted ambient temperature were contributed to its SM behaviors. The shape fixation ratio and shape recovery ratio were 92.0% and 94.2%, respectively. The schematic diagram between internal microstructures and macroscopic properties was proposed. At the same time, the incorporated PLLA showed excellent toughness. So the obtained SM material would be promising for medical and biomimetic fields.

Molybdenum nitride is a commonly used electrocatalyst for ammonia synthesis, and its Faraday efficiency is low, which may be due to many internal grain boundaries and few active sites. In this work, we grow microscale porous Mo2N single crystals and polycrystalline Mo2N from non-porous MoO3 single crystals. Porous molybdenum nitride materials facilitate charge transport in grain boundaries due to their single-crystal nature and enhance the catalytic properties of ammonia synthesis reactions. Compared with polycrystalline Mo2N, the porous Mo2N single crystal shows better performance, with a high NH4 (+) yield of 272.56 mu g h(-1) mg(-1) and a Faradaic efficiency of 7.3%. In addition, the porous Mo2N single crystal exhibits superior long-term stability with little attenuation after 16 h electrolysis reaction. It provides a new method for the catalyst of ammonia synthesis.

Material: Twelve heads, from seven male and five female cadavers, were studied. The thickness of the occipital bone was measured with a digital vernier caliper within a coordinate system. Results: The maximum thickness of the occipital bone could be measured at the external occipital protuberance (mean 15.4 mm; range 9-29.3 mm). All male individuals had higher bone thickness around this point. Further lateral a steady decrease of bone thickness could be observed. Same could be observed in craniocaudal direction. However, values above the superior nuchal line were on average thicker than below. Conclusion: The measurements demonstrated a great individual variability of bone thickness of the occipital bone. The results emphasize the role of preoperative planning for the feasibility of placement of an occipital screw. (C) 2016 Turkish Association of Orthopaedics and Traumatology.

These cements harden without producing much heat, develop compressive strength, and are remodeled slowly in vivo. The main purpose of the cement is to fill voids in metaphyseal bone, thereby reducing the need for bone graft. However, such cements may also improve the holding strength around metal devices in osteoporotic bone. This paper presents the optimum mechanical behavior of calcium phosphate cement/hydroxyl group functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes/bovine serum albumin (CPC/MWCNT-OH/BSA) composites in terms of compressive strength using well-known metaheuristic optimizers. The process parameters studied were wt% of MWCNT-OH (0.2-0.5 wt%) and wt% of BSA (5-15 wt%). The obtained results from metaheuristic algorithms were compared with the results from the response surface methodology (RSM) in the literature. The results obtained from metaheuristic algorithms outperformed the results given by the RSM in terms of less error percentage and high compressive strength.

The adhesive has a hierarchical structure with HA particles at the nanoscale level and pores at the micro-scale level. This adhesive was tested mechanically in the three principal loading modes anticipated: shear, tension, and compression. Standard testing procedures were used when available. Tensile strength of primed adhesive showed a four-fold increase in adhesion on unmodified bone and a nearly two-fold increase in adhesion to primed bone as compared with the conventional bone cement. Biocompatibility was initially assessed in vitro using cell culture tests, which showed positive interaction with the adhesive. Then, a second biocompatibility test was performed using Xenopus laevis limbs to assess an in vivo response. The results indicated that the adhesive material produces a normal response consistent with control specimens. However, long-term observations and tests with additional species are needed to demonstrate full biocompatibility. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the management of pertrochanteric fractures of the femur using gamma nail [Asia pacific (AP)]. Materials and Methods: Sixty patients of pertrochanteric fractures were treated by closed reduction internal fixation by gamma nail from 1 January 1993 to 31 December 2000. Four patients were lost to follow-up. The remaining 56 patients were followed for a mean period of 3.2 years (range 2-4 years).The results were evaluated by assessing the patients regarding their clinical and functional outcome at follow-up as per Kyles criteria. Results: Peroperative jamming of nail ( n = 1), failed distal locking ( n = 1), superior cut out of lag screw ( n = 1) and postoperative varus malreduction ( n = 1) were the complications observed. End results were excellent in 46.34, good in 36.58, fair in 14.64, poor in 2.43. Conclusion: Gamma nail in expert hands is a suitable implant for management of pertrochanteric fractures of the femur.

Material and method We describe the plating after lengthening (PAL) as a new technique on five patients with limb length discrepancy (1 femoral, 4 tibial) who had lengthening procedure with Ilizarov technique. The mean amount of lengthening was 50 mm. The mean lengthening period was 100 days (5-135 days). When the lengthening period ended, the locking compression plate was applied percutaneously by using the technique of minimal invasive plate osteosynthesis, and the Ilizarov external fixator was removed. Results The fixator-free period was achieved at the beginning of the consolidation phase, except in two patients, which were delayed for plating because of pin-tract infection. No complication was encountered except in one patient who had limited flexion of knee joint. There was no need for blood transfusion. Discussion The PAL, which shortened the period of time for the external fixator, was an easy and safe method for the fixation of the bone after limb lengthening.

Optical and scanning electron microscopes were utilized to investigate the fracture surface characteristics. Striations presented on the surface indicated mechanical fatigue. A qualitative material conformity test was conducted using available resources and found to be inconclusive, requiring more advanced testing of Ti-15Mo per ASTM standards in a third-party laboratory. In addition, the investigation showed that there is evidence of overloading failure once the fatigue-propagated crack reached a critical size. Based on the observed features, it is possible that nail and self-tapping helical screw interference may have occurred. The interior wall of the nail exhibited damage, allowing a surface crack to form. This surface crack was propagated due to cyclic loading occurring as a result of activities of daily living. The propagation of cracks formed the striations seen on the failed device. This continued for a period of time up until the crack grew to the point where the structure of the nail could no longer withstand the load and catastrophically failed by overloading.

Structure of first- and second-stage mineralized elements in teeth of the sea urchin <i>Lytechinus variegatus</i>	JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Sea urchin; Tooth; Biomineralization; Calcite; SIMS; SEM	ABSORPTION MICROTOMOGRAPHY MICROCT; TRANSMISSION ELECTRON-MICROSCOPY; SYNCHROTRON X-RAY; STRONGYLOCENTROTUS-PURPURATUS; CALCITE CRYSTALS; MATRIX PROTEINS; SILICON-CARBIDE; GROWTH; MORPHOLOGIES; TOOTH	Microstructure of the teeth of the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus was investigated using optical microscopy, SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and SIMS (secondary ion mass spectroscopy). The study focused on the internal structure of the first-stage mineral structures of high Mg calcite (primary, secondary and carinar process plates, prisms) and on morphology of the columns of second-stage mineral (very high Mg calcite) that cement the first-stage material together. Optical micrographs under polarized light revealed contrast in the centers (midlines) of carinar process plates and in prisms in polished sections; staining of primary and carinar process plates revealed significant dye uptake at the plate centers. Demineralization with and without fixation revealed that the midlines of primary and carinar process plates (but not secondary plates) and the centers of prisms differed from the rest of the plate or prism, and SIMS showed proteins concentrated in these plate centers. SEM was used to study the morphology of columns, the fracture surfaces of mature teeth and the 3D morphology of prisms. These observations of internal structures in plates and prisms offer new insight into the mineralization process and suggest an important role for protein inclusions within the first-stage mineral. Some of the 3D structures not reported previously, such as twisted prisms and stacks of carinar process plates with nested wrinkles, may represent structural strengthening strategies.

The main objective of this work was to compare the functional outcomes and mortality rate in patients who suffered a periprosthetic hip fracture with femoral stem loosening and who were treated either by internal fixation with locking plate only, or in combination with revision of the existing femoral stem with a cemented stem. The secondary objective was to compare the blood loss, procedure duration, length of hospital stay, living arrangements, time to weight bearing and major complications between these two treatment strategies. The starting hypothesis was that there is no difference in the functional outcomes between these two groups. Materials and methods: This was a single center, retrospective study of patients treated between 2013 and 2019. Thirty-six patients (54%) underwent femoral stem revision (FSR group) and 31 patients (46%) were treated by locking plate fixation only (ORIF group). In this population, 19 of the patients had been residing at a nursing home before the surgical treatment: 12 (33%) in the FSR group and 7 (23%) in the ORIF group (p = 0.33). The mean preoperative Parker score was 7.03 (+/- 1.48) in the FSR group versus 5.19 (+/- 1.92) in the ORIF group. The functional outcomes at the final review were evaluated using the Parker score, HHS (Harris Hip score), WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Arthritis Index) and Oxford score. Fracture healing was determined on radiographs centered over the hip joint with the entire femur visible on AP and lateral views. All patients were reviewed at a minimum of 1 year for clinical and radiological assessments. Results: At a mean follow-up of 28 months [12-85], the Oxford score was 40.4 (+/- 10.6) in the FSR group versus 37.1 (+/- 13.5) in the ORIF group (p = 0.34), WOMAC of 45.5 (+/- 26.9) versus 50.5 (+/- 32.4) (p = 0.56), and HHS of 62.7 (+/- 25.5) versus 60.3 (+/- 28.6) (p = 0.79). The Parker score at the final assessment was 5.14 (+/- 1.96) in the FSR group versus 4.64 (+/- 2.17) in the ORIF group (p = 0.33). In the FSR group, 10 patients were at a nursing home (34%), 6 of whom were not there initially, versus 6 in the ORIF group (43%), 5 of whom were not there initially (p = 0.59). The mean operating time was 152 +/- 41.4 minutes (minimum: 85; maximum: 254) in the FSR group versus 89.2 (+/- 44.1) minutes (minimum: 39; maximum: 280) in the ORIF group (p < 0.001). Resumption of full weight bearing occurred at 6 weeks in 21 patients (58%) in the FSR group versus 14 patients (47%) in the ORIF group (p = 0.023). There were 5 major complications (14%) in the FSR group versus 7 (23%) in the ORIF group (p = 0.35). Among the reviewed patients, the union rate was 86% on the latest radiographs in the FSR group versus 78% in the ORIF group. Discussion: There was no statistically significant difference between groups in the various functional scores, confirming our study hypothesis. Internal fixation with a locking plate appears to be an acceptable solution for treating periprosthetic hip fractures in which the femoral stem has loosened. (C) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.

J	Simeonov, L				Simeonov, L.			Which is the Best Solution for Achieving Maximal Interfragmentary Compression of the Scaphoid Fractures - One or Two Herbert Screws?	ACTA CHIRURGIAE ORTHOPAEDICAE ET TRAUMATOLOGIAE CECHOSLOVACA			English	Article						scaphoid fractures; Herbert screw; two screws fixation	FIXATION; WAIST; MANAGEMENT; STABILITY	PURPOSE OF THE STUDY To compare the treatment outcome of scaphoid facture fixation with one versus two Herbert screws (HBS). MATERIAL AND METHODS 72 patients underwent open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) following acute scaphoid fracture, and were followed prospectively by one surgeon. All fractures were Herbert & Fisher classification type B, the most common fracture lines being oblique (n=38) and transverse (n=34). Fractures with similar fracture lines were randomly assigned into two groups; fractures stabilized with one HBS (n=42) and fractures stabilized with two HBS (n= 30). A specific methodology was developed for placement of two HBS; in the case of transverse fractures, screws were introduced perpendicular to the fracture line, for oblique fractures the first screw was placed perpendicular to the fracture line and the second screw was placed along the longitudinal axis of the scaphoid. RESULTS Patients were followed for a total 24 months, no patients were lost to follow-up. Outcome measures included bone healing, duration to bone healing, carpal geometry, range of motion (ROM), grip strength, and the Mayo Wrist Score. Patient rated outcomes were measured using DASH. Bone healing was radiographically and clinically confirmed in 70 patients. There were two non-unions after fixation with one HBS. Radiographic angles in both groups did not differ significantly from the physiological values. The mean duration to bone union was 1.8 months for one HBS and 1.5 months for two HBS. Mean grip strength was 47 kg in the group with one HBS (16-70 kg), 94 % of the unaffected hand, and 49 kg in the group with two HBS, 97% unaffected hand. The average Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score for the group with one HBS was 2.5, while for the group with two HBS was 2.0. Both groups had excellent and good results. For the group with two HBS, they are more. (100% for those fixed with two HBS and for those fixed with one HBS = 95% excellent and good and 5% bad results). DISCUSSION A review of the literature confirms that the addition of the second screw increases the stability in the scaphoid fractures by offering added resistance to torque forces. Most authors propose the parallel placing of both screws in all cases. In our study we offer an algorithm for the placement of screws depending of the type of fracture line. For transverse fractures screws are placed parallel and perpendicular to the fracture line, for oblique fractures the first screw is placed perpendicular to the fracture line, and the second screw is placed along the longitudinal axis of the scaphoid. This algorithm covers the main laboratory requirements for maximal fracture compression depending of the fracture line. CONCLUSIONS This study of 72 patients in whom patients with similar fracture geometry were separated into two groups fixed by one HBS and fixed by two HBS. Analysis of the results demonstrate that osteosynthesis with two HBS creates greater fracture stability. The proposed algorithm for fixation of acute scaphoid fractures using two HBS is achieved by simultaneously placing the screw along the axial axis and perpendicular to the fracture line. The stability is improved by the equal distribution of the compression force on the entire fracture surface.

Seasonal dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus budgets for two sub-tropical estuaries in south Florida, USA	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							NET ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM; ST-LUCIE-ESTUARY; FRESH-WATER; NUTRIENT BUDGETS; CONTROLLING EUTROPHICATION; CALOOSAHATCHEE-ESTUARY; RIVER ESTUARY; MORETON BAY; PHYTOPLANKTON; DENITRIFICATION	Interactions among geomorphology, circulation, and biogeochemical cycling determine estuary responses to external nutrient loading. In order to better manage watershed nutrient inputs, the goal of this study was to develop seasonal dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and phosphorus (DIP) budgets for the two estuaries in south Florida, the Caloosahatchee River estuary (CRE) and the St. Lucie Estuary (SLE), from 2002 to 2008. The Land-Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone (LOICZ) approach was used to generate water, salt, and DIN and DIP budgets. Results suggested that internal DIN production increases with increased DIN loading to the CRE in the wet season. There were hydrodynamic effects as water column concentrations and ecosystem nutrient processing stabilized in both estuaries as flushing time increased to > 10 d. The CRE demonstrated heterotrophy (net ecosystem metabolism or NEM < 0.0) across all wet and dry season budgets. While the SLE was sensitive to DIN loading, system autotrophy (NEM > 0.0) increased significantly with external DIP loading. This included DIP consumption and a bloom of a cyanobacterium (Microcystis aeruginosa) following hurricane-induced discharge to the SLE in 2005. Additionally, while denitrification provided a microbially-mediated N loss pathway for the CRE, this potential was not evident for the SLE where N-2 fixation was favored. Disparities between total and inorganic loading ratios suggested that the role of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) should be assessed for both estuaries. Nutrient budgets indicated that net internal production or consumption of DIN and DIP fluctuated with inter- and intra-annual variations in freshwater inflow, hydrodynamic flushing, and primary production. The results of this study should be included in watershed management plans in order to maintain favorable conditions of external loading relative to internal material cycling in both dry and wet seasons.

Summary of Background Data: The lumbar split fracture-dislocation is a rare but severe injury, which is type C1.2.1 fracture in the Association for the Study of Internal Fixation spine fracture classification. The axial compressive and torsional force shattered the vertebral body into 2 halves and displaced them rotationally. This kind of fracture is so highly unstable that the treatment is very challenging. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to report and compare on clinical outcome and complications of patients with lumbar split fracture-dislocation which had been treated either short-segment or long-segment posterior fixation and anterior fusion. Materials and Methods: A total of 16 patients with acute, split fracture-dislocation of the lumbar spine from March 2000 to May 2009 in our department were recruited. Seven patients (group I) treated by long-segment posterior fixation (2 levels above and 2 below the fracture) and anterior corpectomy and strut grafting. With the improvement of surgical technique and instrument, 9 patients after August 2004 were treated by short-segment posterior fixation (1 level above and 1 below, and included the fractured vertebrae itself) and anterior discectomy and strut grafting. The intraoperative blood loss, operation time, complications of operation, time to achieve bony fusion, Frankel scale, Oswestry Disability index, and Visual Analogue Pain Scale the Cobb angle were collected and compared. Results: The mean follow-up was 33.4 months for group I and 36.2 months for group II. The operation time was 457.1 minutes in group I which was significantly longer than 240.0 minutes in group II. The total blood loss was for group I was 2001.4mL (range, 1580-2500 mL) and for group II was 730.6mL (range, 430-950 mL). There was no neurological deterioration after surgery in both group and no difference in neurological outcome between the 2 groups. The loss of correction in Cobb angle averaged at the final evaluation was 2 and 5 degrees for groups I and II, respectively. There was no radiologically visible pseudarthrosis. The postoperative Visual Analogue Pain Scale score was 3.3 and 2.7 for groups I and II, respectively. In the SF-36 survey, after surgery the domains Role physical and Bodily pain improved significantly only in group B (P<0.05 and P=0.06, respectively). Time to achieve bony fusion in group I was 7.9 months which was significantly longer than 3.8 months in group II. Complications included 3 urinary infections, 1 decubitus ulcer, and 1 superficial infection that were cured by antibiotics. Screw breakage was found in 1 patient in the group II. Conclusions: The lumbar sagittal split fracture-dislocation is a rare but severe injury, which can be treated either with short-segment or long-segment posterior fixation and anterior fusion. The short construct with pedicle screws in the fractured vertebrae followed by the maneuver of rod derotation can obtain anatomic reduction, restoration of 3-column alignment, and decompress the affected neural elements by restoration of the normal canal dimension. It may be a better therapeutic option for the highly unstable lumbar fracture of C1.2.1.

When required, closed fracture reduction can be performed in the emergency department without general anaesthesia but causes pain. The primary objective of this study was to assess an oral analgesia protocol for fracture reduction without general anaesthesia. The secondary objectives were to look for associations linking pain intensity to age, sex, and waiting time and to determine the frequency of secondary displacement requiring closed reduction or internal fixation under general anaesthesia at the 1-week follow-up visit. Hypothesis: An oral analgesia protocol combining a loading dose of morphine with other medications would provide sufficient pain control to obviate the need for general anaesthesia. Material and methods: A prospective observational single-centre study was conducted over a 15-month period (July 2017-October 2018) in consecutive patients younger than 16 years who required reduction of a displaced upper-limb fracture. All patients received the same oral combination of paracetamol (15 mg/kg), ibuprofen (7.5-10 mg/kg), and a loading morphine dose (0.5 mg/kg, up to 20 mg) 1 hour before the procedure. Patients given morphine more than 2 hours before the procedure and those with persistent pain were given an additional morphine dose (0.2 mg/kg, up to 10 mg). An equimolar mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide was administered during reduction. An appropriate scale was used to measure pain intensity before, during, and 15 minutes after the procedure. Cases of secondary displacement requiring further reduction or internal fixation under general anaesthesia at the 1-week follow-up visit were recorded. Results: The 101 study patients (73 male and 28 female) had a mean age of 9.4 years (range, 2-15 years). Mean pain scores were 5.0 +/- 2.6 at admission and 2.1 +/- 2.3, 2.6 +/- 3.3, and 1.3 +/- 2.2 before, during, and after reduction, respectively. Pain intensity during reduction was significantly associated with age. The analgesia was deemed satisfactory by 94 patients and 90 parents. General anaesthesia for further treatment was required in 10 (9.9%) patients, either on the day after the initial treatment, due to inadequate reduction (n = 8), or at the 1-week visit, due to secondary displacement (n = 2). Discussion: Oral morphine in a sufficient dosage given in combination with other medications was effective and well tolerated when used to control pain during upper-limb fracture reduction. Pain intensity was not significantly associated with sex. In contrast, pain was significantly more severe in the patients older than 10 years of age. The proportions of patients requiring further reduction or internal fixation were consistent with previously published data. Most patients and parents were satisfied with the analgesia protocol. Conclusion: A multimodal oral analgesia protocol provides sufficient pain relief to allow closed reduction of upper-limb fractures in children at the emergency department. This management strategy provided high satisfaction rates in both the patients and their parents. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Materials and methods: 100 patients aged 18 years and older undergoing volar plating for acute extra- or intra- articular distal radius fractures were prospectively enrolled. Intraoperative fluoroscopy views, including AP, elevated lateral and DTV were obtained. Intraoperative -screw- revision frequency for dorsal screw protrusion, screw position relative to volar plate and to dorsal compartment, and screw lengths were evaluated. Results: Additional DTV led to a change of intraoperative management in 31 of 100 (31%) of patients. A total of 35 out of 504 screws (6.9%) were changed. Screws in the two most radial screws in the plate were at the highest risk of being revised; 16 (46%) screws in most radial position and nine (26%) screws in the 2nd from radial position were revised. Furthermore, five (14%) screws in both the 2nd from ulnar and most ulnar screw holes were revised after DTV. No screws were revised in the central hole. The median length of revised protruding screws was 22 mm (range, 12-26 mm), and these were changed to a mean length of 20 mm (range, 10-22 mm). Conclusion: In this prospective series of 100 patients, obtaining additional DTV is found to be efficacious as it led to change in intraoperative strategy in one-third of patients. We concur with previous pilot studies that DTV, after obtaining conventional AP and elevated lateral views, is advised to avoid dorsally protruding screws, which could minimise the potential for iatrogenic extensor tendon rupture after volar plating for distal radius fractures. Diagnostic accuracy of DTV is subject of a subsequent prospective cohort study with post-operative CT to serve as the reference standard. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, plates made of alternative materials such as carbon fibre-reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFR-PEEK) have been introduced. This study presents the postoperative results of patients treated with a CFR-PEEK plate.MethodsPatients with proximal humerus fractures treated with a CFR-PEEK plate (PEEKPower (TM) Humeral Fracture Plate (HFP)) were included. In follow-up examination, age and gender adjusted Constant-Murley Score (ACS), Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV), Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Score (QDASH) and pain score (Visual Analog Scale (VAS)) were analyzed. General condition at follow-up was measured by European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 3 Level Version (EQ-5D-3L). Range of motion was recorded. In addition, radiographs at follow-up, unfavorable events and revision rate were analyzed.ResultsIn total, 98 patients (66.0 +/- 13.2 years, 74 females, 24 males) were reexamined. Mean follow-up was 27.6 +/- 13.2 months. There were 15 2-part, 28 3-part and 55 4-part fractures. The functional scores showed good results: SSV 83.3 +/- 15.6%, QDASH 13.1 +/- 17.0 and ACS 80.4 +/- 16.0. A 4-part-fracture, head split component, nonanatomic head shaft reposition and preoperative radiological signs of osteoarthritis were significant negative predictors for poorer clinical scores. Unfavourable events were observed in 27 patients (27.6%). Revision surgery was performed in 8 (8.2%) patients. Risk factors for an unfavourable event were female gender, age of 50 years and older, diabetes, affected dominant hand, 4-part fracture, head split and preoperative radiological signs of osteoarthritis.ConclusionThere are several advantages of the CFR-PEEK plate (PEEKPower (TM) Humeral Fracture Plate (HFP)) such as the polyaxial screw placement and higher stability of locking screws. In summary, the CFR-PEEK plate osteosynthesis is a good alternative with comparable clinical results and some biomechanical advantages. Proximal humerus fractures show good clinical results after treatment with a CFR-PEEK plate. The revision rate and the risk of unfavorable events are not increased compared to conventional titanium plate osteosynthesis.

J	Prasannavenkadesan, V; Pandithevan, P				Prasannavenkadesan, Varatharajan; Pandithevan, Ponnusamy			Mechanistic models to predict thrust force and torque in bone drilling: An <i>in-vitro</i> study validated with robot-assisted surgical drilling parameters	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART E-JOURNAL OF PROCESS MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Mechanistic model; calibration experiment; compression plate; self-tapping screw; cutting lips; indentation zone; chisel edge	TEMPERATURE; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM; EDGE	Compression plates are widely used in orthopaedic surgeries for internal fixation of fractured femurs. To fix the plate and thus to provide compression to a fracture, the self-tapping bone screws are tightened through predrilled pilot holes of smaller diameter. Preliminary investigation showed that the holes drilled with the inappropriate cutting parameters cause mechanical and thermal damages to the local host bone, which further lead to loosening of internal fixations. In this paper, the mechanistic models to predict the thrust forces and torques during bone drilling were developed, using a 3.20 mm diameter drill bit. As a procedure, the cutting action was investigated at three different regions of the drill point, namely cutting lips, secondary cutting edges and indentation zone. The models employed the analytical approach to account for the drill-bit geometry and cutting parameters, and an empirical approach to account for the material and friction properties. To complete the procedure, calibration experiments were conducted on bovine cortical femurs with two different spindle speeds (1000 and 3000 r/min) and feeds (0.03 and 0.06 mm/rev), and then the specific normal and friction coefficients were determined. The developed mechanistic models were validated with different ranges of parameters (500-3500 r/min speeds, and 0.02-0.07 mm/rev feeds) those commonly involved in manual and robot-assisted surgery. The validation study revealed that the thrust forces predicted using the mechanistic models showed a maximum error of only 5.80%. However, the torques predicted from the mechanistic model found with more error than the thrust forces. The predominant reasons for this under-prediction might because of the extrapolation used to determine the specific cutting pressures, slip-line field applied to the indentation zone instead of compressive fracture, and chip clogging involved during the bone drilling as demonstrated in earlier studies. Despite the deviations, the developed mechanistic models satisfactorily follow the trends of the thrust forces and torques experienced during bone drilling. The outcomes can be used to practice the bone drilling procedure and monitor the effect of process parameters on thrust forces and torques in the in-silico environment before performing actual surgery.

Good functional outcomes after open reduction and internal fixation for AO/OTA type 13-C2 and-C3 acute distal humeral fractures in patients aged over 45 years	JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY			English	Article						Elbow; Plating; ORIF; Humerus; Fracture; Outcome; Reoperation; Complication	TOTAL ELBOW ARTHROPLASTY; COMPLEX FRACTURES; HEMIARTHROPLASTY; MANAGEMENT; SCORE	Background: The purpose of this study was to report the functional outcomes and complications after open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for Arbeitsgemeinschaft fueuror Osteosynthesefragen (AO)/Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA) type 13-C2 and -C3 acute distal humeral fractures with minimum 2-year follow-up. Our hypothesis was that ORIF would provide functional outcomes that are comparable to those of total elbow arthroplasty and elbow hemiarthroplasty reported in the literature. Materials and methods: During a 6-year period, 23 patients aged > 45 years were treated with double plating for AO/OTA type 13-C2 or -C3 fractures. The mean age was 62 years (range, 46-80 years). The Oxford Elbow Score was used as the primary outcome; the Mayo Elbow Performance Score, pain severity score (on a visual analog scale), range of motion, reoperations, and complications were used as Results: The median Oxford Elbow Score was 42 (range, 25-48), where a score of 48 represents a normal elbow; 20 patients achieved good to excellent outcomes, and 3 achieved fair outcomes. The median Mayo Elbow Performance Score was 85 (range, 60-100), where a score of 100 represents a normal elbow; 18 patients achieved good to excellent outcomes, and 5 achieved fair outcomes. The median visual analog scale score was 2 (range, 0-5). The median flexion-extension and supination-pronation arcs were 120 degrees (range, 70 degrees-155 degrees) and 160 degrees (range, 75 degrees-170 degrees), respectively. Eight complications were recorded in 7 patients; 4 of them required reoperation because of fracture pseudarthrosis or elbow stiffness. Ten patients were working at the time of trauma, and nine of them returned to the same occupation. Our results are comparable to the results of previously published studies regarding the outcome of ORIF, elbow hemiarthroplasty, or total elbow arthroplasty for AO/OTA type 13-C fractures. Conclusion: ORIF is a reliable treatment option for AO/OTA type 13-C2 and -C3 acute distal humeral fractures in middle-aged and elderly patients, despite the considerable rate of complications. Good to excellent results can be obtained in most patients. (c) 2021 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees. All rights reserved.

The optimal pin configurations in the treatment of supracondylar humerus fractures with coronal lateral obliquity remain controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the stability of various pin configurations in the treatment of lateral oblique supracondylar humerus fractures to provide an acceptable pin placement. Methods: Nine third-generation synthetic composite humeri were osteotomized to simulate a humeral supracondylar fracture with coronal lateral obliquity. Each fracture was reduced and fixed using 2 or three 1.6-mm (0.062 in) Kirschner wires (K-wire) in 3 different configurations, and sequentially tested in extension, varus, valgus, and internal and external rotations using an MTS 858 Minibionix materials testing load frame (MTS Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN). Each fracture was fluoroscopically imaged and the distance between the pins at the fracture site was also recorded. Analysis of variance was carried out to compare construct stiffness for different pin configurations. A paired-samples t test was used to evaluate differences in the distance between the pins for 2 different pin configurations. A level of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: During extension and internal and external rotation loading conditions, the 2 lateral divergent pins had significantly greater stiffness values than 2 crossed pins. During the valgus loading condition, crossed pins were more stable than 2 lateral pins. During varus loading, there was no statistical difference between the 3 pin configurations (P > 0.05). During all the 5 loading conditions, there was a trend for 3 lateral pins to have greater stiffness values than the 2 lateral pins, but this was not statistically significant. The distance between the pins at the oblique fracture site for the 2 lateral divergent pins was statistically greater than the 2 crossed pins. Conclusions: Two and 3 lateral pin configurations had comparable construct stiffness and both were greater than crossed pins, except in the valgus, where crossed pins had greater stiffness. Clinical Relevance: Using these readily available landmarks, the treating surgeon can reproducibly provide appropriate pinning treatment for most of these fractures. In addition, this report represents a helpful reminder that the pinning configuration should be effective and if not, the pins are not positioned correctly.

To tackle this challenge, according to our previous work, carbon fiber (40 mm)-reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFPEEK) composites were developed by using 3D needle-punched CFPEEK preform molding technology. Because of the excellent mechanical properties, the CFPEEK needled felt matrix composites have a broad application prospect in orthopedic internal fixation and implant materials. In order to expand the application range of composite materials, it is very necessary to improve the surface bioactivity of composite materials. The surface modification of CFPEEK with 2D titanium carbide (MXene) nanosheets (sulfonated CFPEEK (SCFPEEK)-polydopamine (PDA)-Ti3C2Tx) for enhanced photothermal antibacterial activity and osteogenicity was explored in this study. Here, the new composites we constructed are composed of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, PDA, and biologically inert SCFPEEK, which gave the bio-inert composites bimodal therapeutic features: photothermal antibacterial activity and in vivo osseointegration. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a CFPEEK implant with a bioactive surface modified by Ti3C2Tx nanosheets was demonstrated. Due to the synergistic photothermal therapy (PTT) treatment of Ti3C2Tx /PDA, SCFPEEK-PDA-Ti3C2Tx (SCP-PDA-Ti) absorbed heat and the temperature increased to 40.8-59.6 degrees C-the high temperature led to bacterial apoptosis. The SCP-PDA-Ti materials could effectively kill bacteria after 10 min of near-infrared (NIR) irradiation at 808 nm. SCP-PDA-Ti (2.5) and SCP-PDA-Ti (3.0) achieved a 100% bacteriostasis rate. More importantly, the multifunctional implant SCP-PDA-Ti shows good cytocompatibility and an excellent ability to promote bone formation in terms of cytotoxicity, diffusion, alkaline phosphatase activity, alizarin red activity, real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, and in vivo bone defect osteogenesis experiments. This provides a more extendable development idea for the application of carbon fiber-reinforced composites as orthopedic implants.

Experimental study with different methods of fixation	HERNIA			English	Article						Hernia; Rats; Mesh; Experimental study; Adhesions; Insulation; Tachosil(&#174)	FIBRIN GLUE; PERITONEAL ADHESIONS; COLLAGEN PATCH; ANASTOMOSES; HERNIAS; REPAIR	Background Adhesion formation is a major problem when a mesh is exposed to intraabodminal viscera, with potential severe complications (bowel occlusion, fistulas or abscesses). New methods for preventing adhesions from a polypropylene mesh placed intra-abdominally or to solve difficult situations, such as when the peritoneum cannot be closed during a TAPP repair for an inguinal hernia, are still being seeked. This study mimics in an animal model a situation that can be found in clinical practice during laparoscopic inguinal hernioplasty. A polypropylene mesh could be exposed to the intra-abdominal cavity even when the peritoneum is closed due to different circumstances, with no options to guarantee the prosthetic material of being exposed to the intrabdominal viscera. Different options have been suggested to solve these situations, being proposed in this study to cover the visceral surface of the mesh with an absorbable sponge containing thrombin, fibrinogen, and clotting factors (Tachosil(R), Nycomed, Takeda, Osaka, Japan), to assess its use as a barrier to prevent postoperative adhesion formation. Material and methods Thirty Wistar white rats (300-450 mg) were included in this study as experimental animals, being randomized into three groups (A, B, and C). We performed a bilateral prosthetic repair with conventional polypropylene mesh (2 x 2 cm, 82 kD). Prosthesis fixation was performed as follows. Group A: absorbable suture; group B: metal staples; group C: metal tackers. A piece of insulating absorbable sponge (Tachosil(R) 5 x 5 cm) was placed to cover the visceral surface of mesh placed at the right side of each animal. After 10 days, we performed a gross examination (by laparoscopy and laparotomy), measuring the quantity and the quality of the adhesions. Samples were taken for histopathological analysis. Results Tachosil(R)-treated prostheses showed a statistically significant decrease in the quality of the adhesion found (p < 0.05). In addition, a smaller quantity of adhesions was identified in barrier-treated animals, although this lacked statistical significance. The histologic analysis showed no significant differences: more edema with the untreated mesh and increased angiogenesis and a lower degree of necrosis in mesh covered with Tachosil(R). Conclusions The use of Tachosil(R) as a barrier material led to the absence of strong adhesions as it prevented direct contact between the mesh and the internal organs, preventing major problems associated with strong adhesions.

The goal of this study was to identify radiological criteria that would make one technique a better choice than the other. Material and methods: This was a comparative, multicentre, retrospective study of 54 cases of antegrade nailing and 53 cases of plating performed between 1st January 2009 and 31 December 2011 for 4-part fractures of the proximal humerus. All patients had a minimum radiological and clinical follow-up of 18 months. The functional outcomes were evaluated using the weighted Constant score; a poor result was defined as a weighted Constant score <70%. The following radiological criteria were evaluated during the preoperative assessment and at the last follow-up: initial displacement and reduction of humeral head and tuberosities; morphology of the medial column (i.e. calcar comminution, posteromedial hinge, size of metaphyseal head extension); occurrence of avascular necrosis (AVN). Results: After an average follow-up of 42 months, the weighted Constant scores and rate of poor outcomes were 77% and 48% in the nail group and 81% and 38% in the plate group, respectively (ns). The humeral head was reduced into an anatomical position, valgus or varus in 57%, 30% and 13% of cases in the nail group, and 58%, 29% and 13% in the plate group, respectively. The tuberosities healed in an anatomical position in 72% of nail cases and 70% of plate cases (ns). Only the presence of a medial hinge preoperatively had an effect on the functional outcomes in the nail and plate groups: the weighted Constant scores (P = 0.05) and rate of poor outcomes (P = 0.02) were 82% and 52% in the nail group and 97% and 9% in the plate group, respectively. The complication rates were comparable: the rates of AVN and articular screw penetration were 17% and 11% in the nail group, and 15% and 11% in the plate group, respectively. The surgical revision rate was 18.5% in the nail group and 30% in the plate group. Conclusion: If the medial hinge is preserved, we recommend locking plate fixation. In other cases, either technique can be used as long as the general rules of internal fixation are applied: reduction of the tuberosities, varus correction and stabilization of the calcar area.

Mid-term outcomes after distally locked-to-standard primary stem exchange in 29 hip-prosthesis patients	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Revision; Arthroplasty; Hip; Locked stem	FEMORAL COMPONENTS; BONE LOSS; REVISION; ARTHROPLASTY; REPLACEMENT; FRACTURES	Background: Cementless locked femoral stems are used for revision surgery in patients with bone loss to induce spontaneous bone reconstruction, allowing subsequent replacement by a standard primary stem. The small number of patients and short follow-ups available to date preclude a valid assessment of this strategy. Hypothesis: After distally locked stem revision, replacement by a standard primary stem does not induce complications, and the quality of the bone reconstruction allows strong fixation of a regular primary stem. Materials and methods: We retrospectively evaluated 29 patients in whom a distally locked femoral stem was replaced by a standard primary stem between 1998 and 2010 (cemented in 27, cementless in 2 cases). The reason for the procedure was stem breakage, stem migration, or thigh pain. Mean patient age was 63 years (range, 39-78 years). Outcomes were evaluated based on the Postel-Merle d'Aubigne [PMA] score and Harris Hip Score [HHS]. In addition, radiographs were obtained to assess prosthesis fixation and the Hofmann cortical index measured the bone reconstruction. Results: The distally locked stem was removed via a postero-lateral approach without femoral osteotomy in all the 29 cases. In one patient, an intra-operative fracture occurred during femoral preparation. Mean follow-up after the exchange procedure was 75 months (range, 3-188 months). Postoperative ccomplications occurred in 9 (32%) patients and consisted of chronic infection in 2 patients (after 3 and 76 months), post-traumatic peri-prosthetic fractures treated with internal fixation in 3 patients (after 100, 138, and 182 months), aseptic loosening in 3 patients (after 13, 39, and 122 months), and recurrent instability in one patient (after 63 months). All cause revision stem survival after 75 months was 72% (95% confidence interval, 47%-87%). In the 19 patients who still had their revision stem at last follow-up, the mean PMA score was 16.7 (range, 13-18) and the mean HHS was 88.2 (range, 59-99). The Hofmann index remained unchanged [36.5% (range, 28%-58%) before the exchange and 32.9% (range, 20%-57%) after the exchange; P = 0.129]. Discussion: This study confirms the feasibility of substituting a distally locked stem with a standard primary stem. No specific complications occurred and no technical difficulties arose when extracting the long stems. However, the 32% complication rate and, more specifically, the occurrence of loosening in 10% (3/29) of patients mandates caution in the use of this technique, which should not be proposed routinely, and suggests a need for considering cementless fixation of the standard primary stem.

The benefit of testing is theorized to be through "active retrieval ", which is the effortful process of recalling stored knowledge. This dif-fers from "passive studying ", such as reading, which is a low effort process relying on recognition. The testing effect is commonly studied in random word list scenar-ios and is thought to disappear as complexity of material increases. Little is known about the testing effect in com-plex situations such as procedural learning. Therefore, we investigated if testing improves procedural learning of fracture fixation as compared to "passive studying ". DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Fifty partici-pants watched an instructional video of an open reduc-tion internal fixation of a SawbonesTM femur. Participants then performed the procedure under guided supervision (pretest). After randomization, they either read the steps (passive studying group), or wrote down the steps from memory (active retrieval group) for a period of 15 minutes. After a washout period, all participants per-formed the procedure without guidance (posttest) and then once more, 1 week after the initial testing (retention test). The participants were assessed using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill. Each perfor-mance was video recorded for data analysis purposes. RESULTS: Participants in the passive studying group had significantly higher Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill scores during immediate assessment com-pared to the active retrieval group (p = 0.001), especially with respect to remembering the correct order of the steps (p = 0.002). The percentage of information forgot-ten was significantly less in the active retrieval group (p = 0.02) at the retention test. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that, compared to pas-sive studying, testing with active retrieval through writ-ing resulted in better retention of fracture fixation knowledge (i.e., less forgetting). These findings can eas-ily be applied and incorporated in existing curricula. Future studies are needed to determine the effects of dif-ferent kinds of active retrieval methods such as verbal retrieval (e.g., dictating) in surgical practice. (J Surg Ed 79:1308-1314.

Materials and methods: The Henry approach was adopted to treat distal radius fractures with pronator quadratus (PQ) preservation on a trial basis. Between June 2015 and January 2017, 46 cases of distal radius fractures were considered according to the Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen (AO) classification. The PQ was preserved, the distal margin was exposed, and a fracture reset was completed by pulling the muscles toward the near side. The K-wires were temporarily fixed, and the plate was placed by a plate channel. The mean operation duration was 52 min and the average blood loss was approximately 30 mL. There were no implant failures, adhesions requiring tenolysis, and tendon rupture. No patient developed carpal tunnel syndrome. All fractures healed without infection, radial artery injury, nerve damage, tendon rupture, and nonunion. A guider was applied to implant a screw under the muscle. Results: In total, 46 patients with PQ preservation between ages 29 to 52 were performed distal radius fracture surgery. AO classification revealed that there were four cases of type A, seven cases of type B3, 10 cases of type C1, 13 cases of type C2, and 12 cases of type C3. For most fractures, such as Types A, B3, C1, C2, and C3, the fracture sites were located around the muscle distal margin. Thus, slight pulling of the muscles to the near side can reveal the fracture, and surgery with PQ preservation can be implemented. The postoperative muscle structures found during hardware removal procedures were similar to the muscle structures before the first operation. The radiographic outcome of fracture fixation was satisfactory. Conclusion: Surgery with PQ preservation is suitable for most distal radius fractures other than Types B1 and B2. For a small part of fractures involving the shaft of the radius, the PQ needed to be partially cut off to complete the operation. The postoperative muscle structures were close to normal.

Materials and methods Out of 85 patients 53 could be contacted, 36 were followed up clinically and radiologically, 17 patients could be interviewed by phone. All fractures have been treated by osteosynthesis with DHS and one additional anti-rotation screw. Functional outcome and quality of life were measured with use of Harris Hip Score (HHS) and Short Form 12 Health Survey (SF 12). The mean values were compared to two random sample t tests and ANOVA for independent random samples. The connection between an aim variable and selected variables of influence was examined by regression analysis. Results The mean HHS showed good functional results with 88 points (median 95.6). Good or excellent results were achieved in 80.4% of cases. The current investigation also delivers promising results with regard to the complication rate: avascular femoral head necrosis (AVN) in 11.3% of cases (n = 6), 9.4% showed non-union (n = 5) and cut out (n = 3) occurred in 5.7%. A secondary conversion to hip arthroplasty (n = 7) had a strong negative impact on everyday life (HHS = 63.3 points, Physical Health Summary Score SF-12 = 34.9 points). Conclusions The results of this study are promising showing uncomplicated fracture healing in 84.9% of intracapsular femoral neck fractures and a low incidence of complications after osteosynthesis with DHS in patients aged up to 69 years. The quality of the fracture reduction achieved in the axial view and a small tip apex index after an osteosynthetically treated femoral neck fracture with DHS are significant predictive indicators for complications. Diabetes, age > 65 years, osteoporosis, ASA III may also be significant factors for worse results, but showed no statistical significance in our analysis.

Early Complications Following the Operative Treatment of Pilon Fractures With and Without Diabetes	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Diabetes; Pilon Fracture; Plafond; Complications	ANKLE FRACTURES; OPEN REDUCTION; EXTERNAL FIXATION; INTERNAL-FIXATION; MANAGEMENT	Background: An increased rate of complications has been clearly shown in diabetic patients undergoing operative treatment for displaced ankle fractures. To date, no studies have specifically looked at the complication rates following the operative management of pilon fractures in this difficult patient population. We performed a retrospective review to determine the rates of complications in diabetic patients undergoing operative fixation of tibial pilon fractures compared with a control group of patients without diabetes. Materials and Methods: The trauma registry was utilized to identify all patients who underwent primary treatment for a tibial pilon fracture between January 2005 and June of 2007 at a single Level 1 trauma center. A minimum of 6-month followup was required for inclusion. A chart and radiographic review was completed to identify the complications seen in each patient population. Specifically, we looked at the rate of infection (superficial and deep), the rate of nonunion or delayed union, and the rate of surgical wound complications. Results: A total of 14 fractures in 13 diabetic patients, and 69 fractures in 68 non-diabetic patients met inclusion criteria. In the diabetic patient group, the average age was 48 years, the average BMI was 35, and 36% of the fractures were open. In the non-diabetic group, the average age was 47 years, the average BMI was 29, and 35% of the fractures were open. Only the difference in BMI was statistically significant. The infection rate was 71% for diabetic patients (43% deep infection), and 19% for non-diabetic patients (9% deep infection) [p < 0.001, odds ratio 10.719 (95% confidence interval 2.914 to 39.798)]. Overall, the rate of non-union/delayed union was 43% in the diabetic group versus 16% in the nondiabetic group [p = 0.02, odds ratio 3.955 (95% confidence interval 1.145 to 13.656)]. The rate of surgical wound complications was 7% in both the non-diabetic and diabetic patient groups. Conclusion: The management of tibial pilon fractures in diabetic patients is difficult, with a high rate of complications compared to non-diabetic patients. These results mirror those previously reported for ankle fractures in diabetic patients.

This may cause implant failure requiring revision surgery. Cement augmentation has, in principle, been shown to improve stability. The aim of this study was to investigate whether augmentation of particular screws of a locking plate aimed at a region of low bone quality is effective in improving stability in a proximal humerus fracture model. Materials and methods: Twelve paired human humerus specimens were included. Quantitative computed tomography was performed to determine bone mineral density (BMD). Local bone quality in the direction of the six proximal screws of a standard locking plate (PHILOS, Synthes) was assessed using mechanical means (DensiProbe (TM)). A three-part fracture model with a metaphyseal defect was simulated and fixed with the plate. Within each pair of humeri the two screws aimed at the region of the lowest bone quality according to the DensiProbe (TM) were augmented in a randomised manner. For augmentation, 0.5 ml of bone cement was injected in a screw with multiple outlets at its tip under fluoroscopic control. A cyclic varus-bending test with increasing upper load magnitude was performed until failure of the screw-bone fixation. Results: The augmented group withstood significantly more load cycles. The correlation of BMD with load cycles until failure and BMD with paired difference in load cycles to failure showed that augmentation could compensate for a low BMD. Discussion and conclusion: The results demonstrate that augmentation of screws in locked plating in a proximal humerus fracture model is effective in improving primary stability in a cyclic varus-bending test. The augmentation of two particular screws aimed at a region of low bone quality within the humeral head was almost as effective as four screws with twice the amount of bone cement. Screw augmentation combined with a knowledge of the local bone quality could be more effective in enhancing the primary stability of a proximal humerus locking plate because the effect of augmentation can be exploited more effectively limiting it to the degree required.

This study sought to quantitatively determine differences in kneeling ability and self-reported knee function in patients managed with either intramedullary nailing (IMN) or open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) with compression plating following distal tibia fracture to assist in the preoperative consent process.Hypothesis: There is no difference in kneeling tolerance following either tibial nailing or plate fixation of distal tibia fractures.Material and methods: Retrospective sampling of public hospital data with outpatient prospective functional testing were completed. The primary outcome measure was the Kneeling Test (KT). Secondary outcome measures were The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and the Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) for the knee joint. There were 28 patients recruited (18 IMN and 10 ORIF) with a mean age of 44 years. Mean overall follow-up was 13.3 months (range 8-25, SD 3.6). All fractures had completely healed without postoperative complication.Results: The IMN affected limb had a significantly worse overall kneeling function than their non-affected limb (mean KT: 70.4 vs. 94.9 respectively, p < 0.005) Additionally, the IMN group performed significantly worse when compared to the ORIF group (mean KT 70.4 vs. 92.5 respectively, p < 0.005). No significant differences (p > 0.05) in kneeling function existed for the ORIF group when comparing affected to non-affected limbs. Secondary outcome analysis showed significantly worse overall WOMAC and FJS in the IMN group compared to the ORIF group (mean WOMAC 19.3 vs. 6.9 respectively, p = 0.040; mean FJS 38.3 vs. 75.9 respectively, p = 0.005).Discussion: The use of intramedullary nailing for the treatment of distal tibia fracture results in a mean reduction of 20% in kneeling tolerance in comparison to ORIF. The resulting kneeling tolerance is comparable to that of patients post-total knee arthroplasty. The present findings should assist in the consent process for patients with high kneeling demands in sportive, professional or cultural pastimes.Level of evidence: IV; retrospective cohort study with quantitative outcome measurement.Crown Copyright (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Classification of complications after progressive long bone lengthening: Proposal for a new classification	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Bone lengthening; Long bone; External fixation; Intramedullary lengthening nail; Complications	TAYLOR SPATIAL FRAME; LOWER-LIMB DEFORMITY; INTRAMEDULLARY NAIL; CHILDREN	Introduction: Long bone lengthening surgery using progressive surgical methods has been the source of frequent complications. Some authors have classified these complications either descriptively, according to the date of onset after the operation, or based on their severity. The Caton classification (1985) has had the virtue of contributing the notion of the treatment contract stipulating the objective to reach in treatment. Within the context of the preoperative information delivered to patients and their family, this contract can be improved by adding a notion of maximum treatment duration. The objective of this study was therefore to propose a classification that includes honoring a triple contract associating the planned gain in bone length, the duration of treatment, and the occurrence of sequelae. Materials and methods: The classification of complications proposed includes four grades: grade I: triple contract honored, including a few treatments without general anesthesia; grade II: triple contract fulfilled, but with unplanned interventions under general anesthesia; grade III: the time stipulated was not honored because the time to obtain bone union was too long or because the program was interrupted; grade IV: sequelae are present. This classification was assessed based on a consecutive series of 34 surgical procedures in 32 patients (two patients underwent two lengthening procedures during this period) at 43 bone segments associating progressive lengthening with external fixation or with nail lengthening. The grade of each complication was determined by each of the authors according to the classification proposed and other classifications reported in the literature (Caton, Paley, Popkov, and Donnan). Results: Approximately one-third (10) of the 34 lengthening procedures did not present any complications. Two-thirds (24) presented 30 complications. Consensus was obtained between all the authors on the grades proposed for our classification and the Caton classification, but consensus was not reached with the other classifications in which part of the interpretation was subjective (Paley, Popkov, and Donnan). Discussion: The classification proposed required respecting predetermined objectives during limb lengthening surgery based on a triple contract: gain, duration, and function. It is reliable and reproducible by different operators because the criteria are objective. It can also be applied to diverse surgical techniques, whether with external fixation and/or internal osteosynthesis.

Recently, a new type of non-cemented fixation of the femoral component, featured with the locking screw hip (LSH) stem, was developed by Scyon Orthopaedics AG (Au-Waedenswil, Switzerland). The idea to rigidly fix the femoral component of a prosthesis for total hip replacement in this fashion evolved from the very good results achieved with the internal point-contact fixator PC-Fix. The purpose of this study was to investigate the unique characteristics of the LSH-stem and to assess its biomechanical performance in comparison to a conventional cemented prosthesis (Mueller straight stem). Material and Methods: Six paired human cadaveric femora were preserved with the method of Thiel, split in two study groups, implanted with either cemented Mueller straight stem or LSH-stem prostheses and biomechanically tested under progressively increasing axial loading until catastrophic failure. Bone mineral density (BMD) of all femora was evaluated in the femoral head prior to implantation. Axial construct stiffness, failure load and cycles to failure were calculated from the machine data and statistically evaluated at a level of significance p = 0.05. Results: No statistically significant difference between the LSH-stem and the Mueller straight stem was found in terms of axial construct stiffness (2031.5 N/mm +/- 483.1 N/mm and 2403.6 N/mm +/- 705.2 N/mm, p = 0.115), failure load (4958.8 N +/- 1094.1 N and 5907.2 N +/- 1562.8 N, p = 0.138) and cycles to failure (7917.7 +/- 2188.1 and 9814.3 +/- 3125.6, p = 0.138). BMD showed no significant difference between the two study groups, p = 0.616. Conclusion: The LSH-stem seems to be stable enough to carry loads experienced during the rehabilitation period of a patient after THR. Its stability, which is similar to that of the Mueller straight stem, may justify the clinical application of the LSH-stem under thorough investigation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods The ATPWF model was constructed using the three-dimensional finite element model of the half pelvis via the Mimics software and three internal devices were used to fix this model: the posterior-column locking plate with anterior-column screws (PCLP), double-column locking plates (DCLP), and NALGP. Next, mesh division was conducted by solid 187 tetrahedral elements in the workbench software. After defining the boundary condition and material properties, each assembly model was loaded in an increasing manner with a downward vertical force of 200, 400, and 600 N, respectively. The loading force was directed at 45 degrees upward in the coronal plane and 25 degrees backward in the sagittal plane. Finally, the stress distribution and stress peak of plates and screws were measured and evaluated, and the displacement of fracture fragments under different loading force was assessed among the three groups. Results For stress distribution, it was found that the stress mainly acted on the posterior-column plate, especially concentrated at the middle and lower section of the plate in all three groups after fixation on the ATPWF. In addition, most stresses of screws appeared on the lag screws instead of the common screws. The common screws in the NALGP group experienced larger stresses under all loading force, while those in the DCLP group withstood less stresses compared to those in the PCLP group. For the displacement of fracture fragments, the NALGP group were found to have less fracture fragment displacements than the PCLP group, but had comparable results to DCLP at both the transverse fracture and the posterior wall fracture sites. Conclusion The newly-designed fixation device showed superiorities on fracture stabilization over PCLP, but had comparable stability to DCLP. This suggests that the DCLP might be unnecessary for treating ATPWF in some instances because it might cause bigger surgical trauma and blood loss.

Materials and Methods: Of 315 cases that underwent internal fixation using PFNA-II between September 2010 and June 2018 among intertrochanteric fracture patients aged over 65 years, a total of 86 patients with an ability to communicate clearly and a minimum follow-up of 6 months were retrospectively reviewed. We classified the subjects according to PFNA-II protrusion over the greater trochanter area on anteroposterior radiographs. Differences between the two groups were examined by comparing demographic characteristics including gender, age, height, weight and BMI, instrumental characteristics including PFNA nail size, nail diameter, blade length and blade position, radiologic characteristics including reduction quality, Dorr type and bone union, and clinical characteristics including GT pain,VAS score and Harris Hip Score (HHS). Results: A total of 86 cases were divided into 30 (34.9%) in the protrusion group (group A) and 56 (65.1%) in the non-protrusion group (group B). No significant difference was found in demographic characteristics such as gender, age, height, weight and BMI between the two groups. Two groups had no statistically significant difference in PFNA nail length, nail diameter and blade length, but showed a statistically significant difference in blade position. At the latest follow-up, the mean HHS shows no statistically significant difference between the two groups. On the contrary, the number of patients complaining of GT pain and VAS score were statistically significantly higher in group A. Removal of metal implants was performed in two patients in the protrusion group due to a complaint of persistent GT pain. Conclusion: Nail protrusion over the greater trochanter area occurs frequently after the surgical treatment of intertrochanteric fracture using PFNA-II. When the nail protruded into the greater trochanter, the number of patients who clinically complained of pain was statistically significantly high. We recommend a modification to the PFNA-II that would further shorten the proximal nail end suitable for the Asian population to achieve better clinical results in the fixation of intertrochanteric fractures.

The most significant OTF complication leading to morbidity is commonly considered to be fracture-related infection (FRI). In September 2016, Tampere University Hospital (TAUH) introduced a treatment protocol for OTFs based on the BOAST 4 guideline. The aim of this study is to investigate the outcomes before and after implementation of the OTF treatment protocol. Materials and methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using handpicked data from the patient record databases of TAUH from May 1, 2007, to May 10, 2021. For patients with OTF, we collected descriptive information, known risk factors for FRI and nonunion, bony fixation method, possible soft tissue reconstruction method, information about the timing of internal fixation and soft tissue coverage, and timing of primary operation. As outcome measures, we collected information on FRI, reoperation due to non-union, flap failure, and secondary amputation. We then compared the incidence of complications before and after the implementation of the OTF treatment protocol at TAUH. Results: After predefined exclusions, a total of 203 patients with OTF were included. Of these, 141 were treated before and 62 after the implementation of the OTF treatment protocol. The FRI rate in the pre-protocol group was significantly higher compared to the protocol group (20.6% vs 1.6%, p = 0.0015). The incidence of reoperation due to nonunion was also significantly higher in the pre-protocol group (27.7% vs 9.7%, p = 0.0054). According to multivariable analysis, definitive fixation and soft tissue coverage performed in separate operations was an independent risk factor for both FRI and reoperation due to nonunion. Conclusions: After implementation, the BOAST 4 based OTF treatment protocol reduced the rate of FRI and reoperation due to nonunion in patients with OTF treated at TAUH during the study period. We, therefore, recommend the implementation of such a treatment protocol in all major trauma centers treating patients with OTF. Furthermore, we also recommend the immediate referral of patients with complex OTF from hospitals lacking the preconditions to provide BOAST 4 based treatment to specialized centers.

The purpose of this study was to examine if hydroxyapatite-coated screw thread on a sliding hip screw (SHS) could reduce screw migration within the femoral head in patients with stable pertrochanteric fractures. Materials and methods In a double-blinded randomized controlled study, 37 patients at mean age 78 (range 56-96), with pertrochanteric fracture (Evans I, II, IV) received surgery with a SHS with a hydroxyapatite-coated or a non-coated lag screw thread. Radiostereometry and standard radiographs were obtained 1 day, 6 weeks, 3- and 6 months post-operatively to evaluate screw and fracture migration and fracture reposition. The two groups were combined to describe fracture migration. Results There was similar and small screw migration in the femoral head between the two groups at 6 weeks, 3- and 6 months (p > 0.12). Fracture migration occurred predominantly in the first 6 weeks, where fracture impaction was 5.95 mm (CI 95% 2.87 to 9.04) and anterior rotation of the femoral head was -2.94 degrees (CI 95% - 5.22 to - 0.66). Migration of the fracture (total translation) correlated to the post-operative fracture reposition (p = 0.002), but not significantly to screw migration (p = 0.09). Neither screw total translation (rho 0.06, p = 0.79) nor fracture total translation (rho 0.04, p = 0.77) correlated with bone mineral density. Conclusion There was no clinical benefit of hydroxyapatite coating on lag screw migration in this patient cohort.

J	Kumar, C; Gupta, AK; Nath, R; Ahmad, J				Kumar, Chandan; Gupta, Anil Kumar; Nath, Rohit; Ahmad, Javed			Open reduction and locking plate fixation of displaced proximal humerus fractures	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Proximal humerus locking plate; proximal humerus fracture; unstable fracture	SURGICAL-TREATMENT; 4-PART FRACTURES; PHILOS PLATE; 3-PART; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; SHOULDER; SYSTEM	Background: Treatment of proximal humerus fractures is controversial and various operative modalities have been tried in the literature. The aim of the present study was to evaluate functional outcome and complication rate after open reduction and internal fixation of displaced proximal humerus fractures by proximal humerus locking plate. Materials and Methods: 52 patients with displaced proximal humerus fractures treated with proximal humerus locking plate between May 2008 and October 2010 were included in the study. Fractures were classified according to Neer's classification into displaced 2-part, 3-part, and 4-part fractures. Patients were followed for a minimum period of 1 year. 11 patients had less than 1 year of followup and were not considered in the evaluation of final results. Forty one patients were considered for final evaluation. Functional evaluation was done according to the Constant-Murley scoring system. Constant score was compared between 2-part, 3-part, and 4-part fractures at final up and also between young (<= 60 yrs) and old (>60 yrs). Results: 11 patients had 2-part fractures, 22 patients had 3-part fractures, and 19 patients had 4-part fractures. The mean followup period was 15.21 +/- 2.59 months. 65.8% (n = 27) patients had good to excellent result, 19.5% (n = 8) had fair, and 14.7% (n = 6) had poor result. Constant scores for 2-part (79.83 +/- 6.95) and 3-part fractures (74.22 +/- 12.53) were significantly superior to those of 4-part fractures (61.09 +/- 14.29) (P value = 0.002 and 0.018, respectively). Difference between 2-part and 3-part fractures was not significant (P value = 0.623). There was no significant difference between younger (<= 60) and older patients (>60). Complications encountered in this series were varus malreduction in 17% (n = 7), screw perforation in 10% (n = 4), plate impingement in 12% (n = 5), infection in 2% (n = 1), and nonunion in 2% (n = 1) of cases. Conclusion: Proximal humerus locking plate gives reliable fixation for 2-part and 3-part fractures. Its use in more complicated fracture patterns of 4-part fractures is associated with poor clinical outcome.

J	Hesse, B; Gächter, A				Hesse, B; Gächter, A			Complications following the treatment of trochanteric fractures with the gamma nail	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						trochanteric fracture; gamma nailing; intramedullary fracture fixation; geriatric surgery; complications	PROXIMAL FEMORAL NAIL; DYNAMIC HIP SCREW; PERITROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; INTERTROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; NECK FRACTURE; GLIDING NAIL; FEMUR; EXPERIENCE; FAILURE	Introduction The treatment of trochanteric fractures with the use of gamma nails has become an established method. Despite the good and reliable results, some typical failures and complications may occur. It was our purpose to analyse the most common complications and their treatment options. Materials and methods A total of 498 patients were treated with a gamma nail from January 1992 until December 2001. There were 77% pertrochanteric, 10% subtrochanteric, 11% reversed pertrochanteric and 2% lateral femoral neck fractures. The patients' mean age was 78.6 years ( ranging from 29 to 98 years). Results There were a total of 78 general complications ( 16%) and implant-related complications in 8% (n = 42). The most common complication was trochanteric pain necessitating removal of the gamma nail (n = 30). Four patients fell after removal of the nail and sustained a neck fracture on the same side. Cut-out of the screw occurred in 19 patients. Sixteen of them had to be converted to a total hip replacement. Another 5 patients were converted to a total hip replacement because of pseudoarthrosis. During conversion to total hip replacements, the trochanter major refixation and length adjustment were the most problematic steps (intra- or postoperative dislocations necessitating anti-dislocation rings in three cases). Furthermore, cement extrusion at the femur and acetabulum occurred in 13 cases. Infections occurred in 3 patients. Five patients with a short gamma nail needed a conversion to a long gamma nail due to pseudoarthrosis (n = 2) or femur fracture at the distal interlocking bolt (n = 3). In addition, 7 patients sustained a distal femur fracture through the distal bolt, necessitating a plate osteosynthesis. Conclusion Most complications after gamma nail fixation can be prevented by following certain rules. The other inevitable problems can be dealt with either through a conversion to a total hip replacement, a re-osteosynthesis with a long gamma nail or an additional condylar plate. Conversion to total hip replacement may be a demanding operation with a higher than normal complication rate. Removal of the gamma nail should be performed cautiously as re-fractures can occur.

Since the recognition of the importance of syndesmotic injury in ankle fractures, much of the scientific work has been focused on concomitant syndesmotic injury. Despite the invention of novel devices for restoration and maintenance of the congruent syndesmosis following syndesmotic injury, the metallic syndesmotic screw is still considered to be the "gold standard''. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical results in patients who retained the syndesmosis screw with those in whom the screw was removed following open reduction and internal fixation of the malleolar fracture associated with syndesmosis disruption. Materials and methods: This was a retrospective study of 82 patients. Minimum follow-up was 12 months. Clinical evaluation included American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for patient general satisfaction. The condition of the screw (removed, intact or broken), presence of radiolucency around the syndesmotic screw and the tibiofibular clear space were recorded using final follow-up radiographs. Results: Three cortices were engaged in 66 patients (80%) and quadricortical fixation was performed in the remaining 16 patients (20%). The number of engaged cortices did not correlate with the clinical outcome and screw fracture. A single syndesmotic screw was used in 71 patients (86%. The mean AOFAS score in the group with intact screw (I) was 83; the scores in the group with broken screw (B) and removed screw (R) were 92.5 and 85.5, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the three groups: this was due to the difference between groups I and B; the difference between groups I and R and groups B and R were not statistically significant. There were no statistically significant differences in VAS results. Conclusion: There were no statistically significant differences in clinical outcome between the group with the screw retained and the group in which the screw was removed; however, the group with broken screws had the best clinical outcome based on AOFAS score. Widening of the syndesmosis after screw removal was not evident. We do not recommend routine syndesmosis screw removal. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Gupta, RK; Gupta, V; Gupta, N				Gupta, Rakesh Kumar; Gupta, Vinay; Gupta, Navdeep			Outcomes of osteoporotic trochanteric fractures treated with cement-augmented dynamic hip screw	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Dynamic hip screw; fractures; osteoporosis; polymethylmethacrylate; trochanteric	UNSTABLE INTERTROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; FEMORAL FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; FEMUR; NAIL; METHYLMETHACRYLATE; TRIAL	Background: Dynamic hip screw (DHS) has been the standard treatment for stable trochanteric fracture patterns, but complications of lag screw cut out from a superior aspect, due to inadequate bone anchorage, occur frequently in elderly osteoporotic patients. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) has been used as an augmentation tool to facilitate fixation stability in cadaveric femora for biomechanical studies and in pathological fractures. However, there are very few reports on the utilization of PMMA cement to prevent these complications in fresh intertrochanteric fractures. A prospective study was conducted to evaluate the outcome and efficacy of PMMA augmented DHS in elderly osteoporotic patients with intertrochanteric fractures. Materials and Methods: The study included 64 patients (AO type31-A2.1 in eight, A2.2 in 29, A2.3 in 17 patients, and 31-A3.1 in five, A3.2 in three, and A3.3 in two patients) with an average age of 72 years (60 - 4 years) of which 60 were available for final followup. PMMA augmentation of DHS was performed in all cases by injecting PMMA cement into the femoral head with a custommade gun designed by the authors. The clinical outcome was rated as per the Salvati and Wilson scoring system at the time of final followup of one year. Results were graded as excellent (score > 31), good (score 24 - 31), fair (score 16 - 23), and poor (score < 16). Results: Fracture united in all patients and the average time to union was 13.8 weeks (range 12 - 16 weeks). At an average followup of 18 months (range 12 - 24 months), no incidence of varus collapse or superior screw cut out was observed in any of the patients in spite of weightbearing ambulation from the early postoperative period. There was no incidence of avascular necrosis (AVN) or cement penetration into the joint in our series. Most of the patients were able to regain their prefracture mobility status with a mean hip pain score of 8.6. Conclusion: Cement augmentation of DHS appears to be an effective method of preventing osteoporosis related complications of fracture fixation in the trochanteric fractures. The technique used for cement augmentation in the present study is less likely to cause possible complications of cement augmentation like thermal necrosis, cement penetration into the joint, and AVN hip.

There are 2 different surgical approaches for the therapy of these fractures: closed reduction and open reduction. In the open reduction 2 or 3 fixation points with related incisions are usually necessary in dislocated fractures: osteosynthesis must be performed starting from zygomaticofrontal suture when dislocated at this site, followed by zygomatic body fixation on the anterior sinus wall, anterior orbital floor margin fixation, and finally orbital floor reconstruction in case of eye globe dislocation with diplopia.Aim:This study evaluated the combination of the transconjunctival (TC) approach without canthotomy in association with the transoral maxillary approach and lateral rim skin incision (SI) without canthotomy for frontozygomatic dislocated fractures to achieve proper reduction and stabilization without any aesthetic decay in young patients. A less invasive and more aesthetic technique is shown for treating dislocated zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures with 2 or 3 fixation points and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) use to promote tissue healing.Materials and methods:Ten patients (mean age: 32) were referred for dislocated zygomaticomaxillary complex fracture. Five patients were treated by TC approach without canthotomy in association with the transoral maxillary approach and, when needed, eyebrow SI without canthotomy for frontozygomatic dislocated fractures (group 1). Five more patients were treated by traditional subciliar incision at lower eyelid and vertical lateral incision at lateral margin of the orbit (group 2). Autologous PRF for orbital floor reconstruction was used. The follow-up period was 6 months long. Follow-up radiographs (TC) and photos were routinely used to evaluate the adequacy of reduction and lower eyelid right position or retraction.Results:All cases were successful; there were no problems at surgery and postoperative time. During the 6-month follow-up, all 5 patients of group 1 showed satisfactory facial symmetry, no noticeable scarring, no ectropion or lower eyelid significant droop, and no functional impairment. Mean difference for lower eyelid droop between the 2 groups of patients was 1.4mm at T1 and 1.2mm at T2.Discussion:Aesthetic result is a priority in the treatment planning of orbitozygomatic fractures because of the fundamental role of the eye and lid area in the aesthetic of the face. In our experience best aesthetic results were achieved through a latero cantal horizontal SI combined to a vertical periosteal incision at the frontozygomatic rim without canthotomy, thus performing a different double-layer incision. In the patients with large orbital floor dislocation, reconstructive titanium mesh was covered by autologous PRF membranes, which can improve the vascularization of the surgical site, by promoting neoangiogenesis.Conclusions:In young patients these techniques are indicated because of the need of better aesthetic results that can be achieved by preventing postoperative functional impairment with lower eyelid droop and unnatural aesthetic asymmetry of the 2 lower lids. This more conservative technique resulted in better aesthetic results, avoiding most common complications.

Bioresorptive poly-L-lactide (PLLA) as a polymer biomaterial has been also used extensively in medicine for its non-toxicity and biocompatibility. To combine the advantages exhibited by each of these materials, a HAp/PLLA composite biomaterial has been synthesized and used for reconstruction and repair of bone defects. Hydroxyapatite/poly-L-lactide (HAp/PLLA) composite biomaterial with PLLA of 50,000 and 430,000 g/mole molecular weight was studied in vivo. The biocomposite with PLLA of both molecular weights was implanted into mice, then removed from their organisms and analyzed by the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and histopathologic analysis. Characteristic absorption bands, registered and defined by FT-IR spectroscopy, confirm the formation of new functional groups and compounds during the bone repair process using HAp/PLLA biocomposite with PLLA of 50,000 and 430,000 molecular weights. Analysis of the microstructures of the sample surfaces by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) before and after implantation revealed bioresorption of the PLLA polymer phase in the system with PLLA of lower molecular weight and generation of collagen fibers at the sites of implanted bioresorptive PLLA. As the studied synthetic materials behave as the natural bone, i.e., they are phagocytosed and resorpable, they can be considered as biocompatible.

However, low electron transfer rates at microorganism-cathode interfaces can limit CO2 conversion efficiency. A nanoarrays/bacteria hybrid system was proposed for bioelectrochemical reduction of CO2 to CH4. The hierarchical nanoarrays derived from metal-organic frameworks enhanced the CO2 conversion rate with the optimization of both a local electric field and Ni/Co dual metal active sites. Optimizing the electric field intensity (similar to 1.25-fold compared to bare CF) and introducing a heterojunction on the cathode material boosted the electron transfer and achieved a higher current density (maximum 10 A/m(2)) at -0.9 V (vs Ag/AgCl) for 9.6-fold CH4 production (697.9 mmol.day(-1).m(-2)) compared to the control. The dual metal active sites provided extra electron shuttles from a cathode to a microorganism to boost the electron transfer for methane production with a thicker (similar to 1.3-fold) and enhanced conductive EPS production (similar to 1.68-fold). A decreased internal resistance, a reconstituted microbial community, and an enhanced methane production rate indicated an increase in the microbial electron transfer between Methanobacterium and Clostridia, resulting in a selective bioelectroreduction (84%) of CO2 to CH4. This study suggests that nanointerface engineering in electromethanogenesis systems can effectively regulate selective CO2 reduction for new generation biogas projects.

In clinical studies, the efficiency of the technique could be successfully proven by using a transducer coil. The advantage of the traditional technique was the variety of its applications in connection with various osteosynthesis systems; the disadvantage was a possible failure of the contacting leads and the resulting functional breakdown. Materials and methods: A newly developed BISS screw (bipolar induction screw system) with integrated coil and electrodes was compared to a standard cannulated screw used in the traditional technique. The strength of BISS screws (n=6) and of cannulated screws (n=6) was evaluated in comparative biomechanical tests. Examinations consisted of torsional and static and dynamic cantilever tests. All screws were made of the same material (TiAl6V4) and had identical outer dimensions. Results: No significantly lower strengths could be observed when we compared BISS screws with cannulated screws. The BISS screws even showed significantly higher mechanical values due to a reinforcing effect by the attached electrode. Conclusion: In the modified concept of the new BISS screw, both coil and electrodes are housed in only one cannulated screw. No negative effects concerning mechanical strength and durability were associated with the new screw concept. This provides for a simpler implantation and makes removal easier, while the risk of a cable tear is avoided.

In 2012, we discovered a unique microorganism with a cell structure intermediate between those of prokaryotes and eukaryotes from the deep sea off the coast of Japan and named it Parakaryon myojinensis. We also reported another unique bacterium found in the same place that we named as Myojin spiral bacteria. Here, we report the third unique bacteria we discovered by structome analysis and 3D reconstruction using serial ultrathin sectioning of freeze-substituted specimens from the same place. The bacteria showed elongated flattened cell bodies with uneven surfaces. The cells consisted of outer amorphous materials, cell wall, cytoplasmic membrane, ribosomes, fibrous materials, and vacuoles. They had a total length of 1.82 +/- 0.40 mu m, a total volume of 0.37 +/- 0.09 mu m(3), and had 1150 +/- 370 ribosomes within a cell; the density of the ribosomes in the cytoplasm was 312 +/- 41 per 0.1fL. Each bacterium showed different shapes but appears to belong to a single species because they have similar size and volume, have similar internal structure, inhabit a confined area, and have similar ribosome density in the cytoplasm. We named it the 'Myojin amorphous bacteria' after the location of discovery and its morphology. This is the first report on the existence of amorphous bacteria.

Materials and Methods: Le Fort III osteotomies were performed on 3 juvenile minipigs, followed by implantation of the bioabsorbable distractors. After a 5-day latency period, the distraction progressed at a rate of 1 mm/day in 2 equal increments for 12 days. This was followed by a 6-week consolidation phase. Cephalometric radiographs were taken postoperatively, on completion of distraction and after the consolidation phase, to evaluate the amount of distraction that was obtained. Necropsy was performed at the completion of each experiment. Results: The first minipig was sacrificed at the end of the distraction period because of device failure. On necropsy, it was noted that the anterior footplate on either side had failed. The second minipig was sacrificed during the latency period because of severe pneumonia. On necropsy, it was noted that none of the footplates had failed but that the distraction barrels on either side had become dislodged from the anterior bioabsorbable footplates. The third minipig was sacrificed at the end of the distraction period because of device failure. On necropsy, it was noted that the posterior bioabsorbable footplates on either side were fractured across the posterior screw lines. Conclusions: The bioabsorbable devices evaluated in this study could not withstand the forces generated during distraction osteogenesis in the minipig model. Experience with the prototypes may help in designing internal bioresorbable Le Fort III distraction devices.

The purposes of this study were: (1) to measure the proper length of periarticular screws of the PHILOS plate in the humeral head, and (2) to determine what factors influence the screw length and implantation of the inferomedial support screw. Material/Methods: Computed tomography (CT) images of the normal proximal humerus in 134 cases were retrospectively reviewed. The length of periarticular screws was measured using three-dimensional (3D) techniques. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability of measurement were evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Sex and body height influences on screw length and implantation of the inferomedial screw were analyzed. Results: All measurements had excellent agreement (ICC>0.75). The screw length and implantation rate of the inferomedial screw were greater in males than in females. Positive correlations were observed between body height and screw length and implantation of the inferomedial screw (all P<0.001). Conclusions: The screws were longer and the implantation rate was higher for inferomedial screws in males than in females, and were positively correlated with body height. Our data can be used as a reference for surgeons to reduce the number of times screws are changed intraoperatively and to reduce operation duration and minimize use of intraoperative fluoroscopy for proximal humerus fractures treated with the PHILOS plate.

The hypotheses tested were that the finish line type would not influence the MD or ID of the crowns, and ID would not change in different regions. Materials and Methods: Three aluminum master dies (height: 5.5 mm, O: 7.5 mm, conicity: 6.) with different finish lines (TC: tilted chamfer; LC: large chamfer; RS: rounded shoulder) were manufactured. Ten impressions were made from each master die using a modified parallelometer. Impressions were poured in type IV dental stone, and 30 ceramic crowns (IPS Empress CAD, Ivoclar) were subsequently milled. The crowns were fixed on their respective metallic die using a metallic fixation device. The distance between the external edges of the crown to the edge of the cervical preparation was performed at 50 points on the respective metallic die (MD analysis). With the replica technique, the ID values of each crown were further evaluated at 12 points equidistant to each other in three regions: radius (R), axial (A), and occlusal (Occl). The measurements were performed using an optical microscope (250x). The data (mu m) were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's test (5%). Results: The RS group (28.24 +/- 11.42 mu m) showed significantly lower MD values (p = 0.001) than those of TC (99.92 +/- 18.32 mu m) and LC (64.71 +/- 25.64 mu m) groups, both of which also differed statistically from one another. The ID results demonstrated significantly lower values in the LC group (183.01 +/- 62.82 mu m) (p = 0.0014) than those of TC (216.26 +/- 83.23 mu m) and RS (219.12 +/- 87.24 mu m) groups. ID results of TC and RS were not significantly different. Additionally, the ID results showed significant differences among the regions (p = 0.0001). The null hypotheses were rejected. Conclusion: The RS finish line produced MD values significantly lower than tilted and large chamfer, but large chamfer presented the lowest internal discrepancy values. Independent of the finish line type, internal discrepancy was the lowest in the axial region followed by radius and occlusal regions.

An unstable fracture gap model with two standardized polyoxymethylene (POM) cylinders was used for this study. With this model 5 LOQTEQ(A (R)) HTO plates and 5 TomoFix (TM) were cyclically loaded. The start load was 100 N and increased by 50 N after each successful completed cycle. Each load step included 250,000 cycles. All tests were performed in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard Specification and Test Method for Metallic Bone Plates F382-99(2003)e1. The mean fatigue strength of the LOQTEQ(A (R)) HTO Plate was 155 % of the value gained by the TomoFix (TM) implant. This difference was statistically significant (t test < 0.001). There was also a significant difference in the cycles but both implants survived. The LOQTEQ(A (R)) HTO Plate system survived 1,520,336.8 (+/- 121,687.7) cycles, whereas the TomoFix (TM) group passed on average 847,802,600 (+/- 134,660.7) cycles. In both groups, the only failure mode was plate breakage in a shaft hole. The results of the present study showed that fatigue strength of the LOQTEQ(A (R)) HTO plate was significantly higher in comparison to TomoFix (TM). These results justify the clinical use of the LOQTEQ(A (R)) HTO plate.

Material and methods: From January 2014 to December 2017, 56 Weber type C unstable lateral malleolar fractures with syndesmosis injury were identified. The fibular fracture patterns were simple oblique or transverse in 20, comminuted in 25, and Maisonneuve injury with fibular neck fractures in 11 cases. 47 cases were operated with ORIF, and 9 cases of Maisonneuve fractures were operated with CRIF. The mortise view of the contralateral uninjured ankle was used for intraoperative comparison. Two indexes were applied for fluoroscopic detection of distal fibula malrotation, i.e. the contour profile change in lateral malleolar shape, and the intrinsic structure appearance of lateral malleolar fossa cortex. Postoperative talofibular joint congruency was measured on axial CT scan to confirm the reduction quality. Results: Using the two radiographic parameters for intraoperative fluoroscopic evaluation, we finally achieved satisfying reduction and fixation of the lateral malleolus in all 56 cases. A more spoon-shaped fibula profile and disappearance of the lateral fossa cortex shadow indicates an internal rotation, while a more pointed blade-shaped fibula profile and disappearance of lateral fossa cortex shadow indicates an external rotation. Postoperative CT scanning identified distal fibular no rotation in 44 cases (78.6%), mild rotation less than 5 degrees in 12 cases (21.4%), with 7 cases internal rotation (mean 3.1 degrees) and 5 cases external rotation (mean 2.8 degrees). Conclusion: Using conventional intraoperative fluoroscopy on mortise view, new radiographic parameters can provide reliable method to detect rotational malreduction of the lateral malleolus.

BIOPOLYMER AUGMENTATION OF THE LAG SCREW IN THE TREATMENT OF FEMORAL NECK FRACTURES - A BIOMECHANICAL IN-VITRO STUDY	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article							DYNAMIC HIP SCREW; UNSTABLE INTERTROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; GAMMA LOCKING NAIL; BONE-MINERAL DENSITY; TROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; SLIDING CHARACTERISTICS; CANCELLOUS BONE; HOLDING POWER; STRENGTH	The cut-out of the sliding screw is one of the most common complications in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures. The reasons for the cut-out are: a suboptimal position of the hip-screw in the femoral head, the type of fracture and poor bone quality. The aim of this study was to reproduce the cut-out event biomechanically and to evaluate the possible prevention of this event by the use of a biopolymer augmentation of the hip screw. Concerning the density and compression force of osteoporotic femoral bone polyurethane foam according to the terms of the Association for Standard Testing Material (ASTMF 1839-97) was used as test material. The polyurethane foam Lumoltan 200 with a compression force of 3.3 Mpa and a density of 0.192 g/cm(3) was used to reproduce the osteoporotic bone of the femoral fragment (density 12 lbm/ft(3)). A cylinder of 50 mm of length and 50 mm of width was produced by a rotary splint raising procedure with planar contact. The axial load of the system was performed by a hydraulic force cylinder of a universal test machine type Zwick 1455, Ulm, Germany The CCD-angle of the used TGN-System was preset at 130 degrees. The migration pattern of the hip screw in the polyurethane foam was measured and expressed as a curve of the distance in millimeter [mm] against the applied load in Newton [N] up to the cut-out point. During the tests the implants reached a critical changing point from stable to unstable with an increased load progression of steps of 50 Newton. This unstable point was characterized by an increased migration speed in millimeters and higher descending gradient in the migration curve. This peak of the migration curve served as an indicator for the change of the hip screw position in the simulated bone material. The applied load in the non-augmented implant showed that in this group for a density degree of 12 (0,192 g/cm(3)) the mean force at the failure point was 1431 Newton (+/- 52Newton). In the augmented implant we found that the mean force at the failure point was 1987 Newton (+/- 84 Newton). This difference was statistically significant. In conclusion, the bone density is a significant factor for the stability of the hip screw implant. The osteosynthesis with screws in material with low density increases the chance for cut-out. A biopolymer augmented hip screw could significantly improve the stability of the fixation. The use of augmentation with a fast hardening bone replacement material containing polymer-ceramic changes the point of failure under axial load in the osteoporotic bone model and could significantly improve the failure point. Our study results indicate, that a decrease of failure in terms of cut-out can be achieved with polymer augmentation of hip screws in osteoporotic bones.	[Paech, A.; Wilde, E.; Schulz, A.

To be effective and not interfere with growth of the child's skull, the plates must biodegrade sufficiently to release the holding power of the plate and screw within 1 year. It is also essential that excessive foreign body reaction and cyst formation does not occur when the plates and screws biodegrade. The purpose of this experimental study was to evaluate the rate of biodegradation of Inion CPS Baby biodegradable plates and screws under different clinical circumstances in the rabbit craniofacial skeleton and evaluate their efficacy for use in pediatric craniofacial surgery. Foreign body reaction would be evaluated. Inion baby plates and screws were tested in a rabbit model. Plates were applied to-the frontal bone, over a bony defect of the parietal bone, to a nasal bone fracture, and inserted in the subcutaneous space over the occipital bone in thirty 6-week-old rabbits. Six rabbits were euthanized at 9, 12, 15, and 18 months' postoperative time point and examined for residual plates and screws. Bone from each surgical site was excised, fixed by immersion in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, decalcified in Immunocal solution, and examined by 7-mu m paraffin sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. At 9 months, the plates and screws had effectively biodegraded and no longer had holding power on the bones. Fragmentation of the implant material was noted. Residual implant material was still present on gross and histologic examination in rabbits at 9, 12, 15, and 18 months. Residue of a screw was still palpable in 1 rabbit at 18 months. There was no evidence of cyst formation in any of the examined specimens. Macrophages and giant cells were present in most of the specimens at 9, 12, 15, and 18 months. Findings from the current study revealed a relative short resorption time (9 mo) and normal inflammatory sequelae in an adult rabbit model. These findings suggest that these plates may be used safely in fixing the pediatric craniofacial skeleton.	[Losken, H.

Direct electromagnetic coupling to determine diagnostic bone fracture stiffness	ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Fracture healing; fracture stiffness; bone; nonunion; diagnostic	INSTRUMENTED INTERNAL FIXATOR; COMPUTATIONAL SIMULATION; TISSUE DIFFERENTIATION; INTRAMEDULLARY NAIL; TIBIAL FRACTURE; PLATE FIXATION; RISK-FACTORS; GAP SIZE; STABILITY; NONUNION	Background: Rapid prediction of adverse bone fracture healing outcome (e.g., nonunion and/or delayed union) is essential to advise adjunct therapies to reduce patient suffering and improving healing outcome. Radiographic diagnostic methods remain ineffective during early healing, resulting in average nonunion diagnosis times surpassing six months. To address this clinical deficit, we developed a novel diagnostic device to predict fracture healing outcome by noninvasive telemetric measurements of fracture bending stiffness. This study evaluated the hypothesis that our diagnostic antenna system is capable of accurately measuring temporal fracture healing stiffness, and advises the utility of this data for expedited prediction of healing outcomes during early (<= 3 weeks) fracture recovery. Methods: Fracture repair was simulated, in reverse chronology, by progressively destabilizing cadaveric ovine metatarsals (n=8) stabilized via locking plate fixation. Bending stiffness of each fracture state were predicted using a novel direct electromagnetic coupling diagnostic system, and results were compared to values from material testing (MT) methods. While direct calculation of fracture stiffness in a simplistic cadaver model is possible, comparable analysis of the innumerable permutations of fracture and treatment type is not feasible. Thus, clinical feasibility of direct electromagnetic coupling was explored by parametric finite element (FE) analyses (n=1,632 simulations). Implant mechanics were simulated throughout the course of healing for cases with variations to fracture size, implant type, implant structure, and implant material. Results: For all fracture states, stiffness values predicted by the direct electromagnetic coupling system were not significantly different than those quantified by in vitro MT methods [P=0.587, P=0.985, P=0.975; for comparing intact, destabilized, and fully fractured (FF) states; respectively]. In comparable models, the total implant deflection reduction (from FF to intact states) was less than 10% different between direct electromagnetic coupling measurements (82.2 mu m) and FE predictions (74.7 mu m). For all treatment parameters, FE analyses predicted nonlinear reduction in bending induced implant midspan deflections for increasing callus stiffness. Conclusions: This technology demonstrates potential as a noninvasive clinical tool to accurately quantify healing fracture stiffness to augment and expedite healing outcome predictions made using radiographic imaging.

Since aberrant radiographic views might influence the assessment of fracture displacement, it was the goal of this study to investigate the impact of aberrant beam paths on radiographic assessment of PHF.Materials and methodsTen consecutive patients with a displaced PHF, bilateral computed tomography (CT) scan, and a true clinical AP radiograph were included. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) were generated and aberrant beam paths were simulated by rotation of +/- 30 degrees around the horizontal (flexion and extension) and vertical axis (internal and external rotation) by increments of 10 degrees. Measurement of the neck-shaft-angle (NSA) and eccentric head index (EHI) addressed humeral angulation and offset, respectively. Paired comparisons determined the influence of aberrant beam paths on both measurements between incremental altered views, and between clinical and digital true AP views. Descriptive statistics assessed the change in Neer classification and recommended treatment.ResultsTrue AP DRRs approximated the clinical true AP view by a mean difference of 2 degrees for NSA, and a mean difference of 0.12 for EHI. NSA in injured shoulders was most susceptible to malrotation around the vertical axis (p < 0.03), with largest differences seen for internal rotation. Aberrant projections in extension had no influence on NSA (p > 0.70), whereas flexion of >= 20 degrees and 30 degrees demonstrated differences in injured and uninjured shoulders, respectively (p < 0.05). EHI was only influenced by malrotation in internal rotation in uninjured shoulders (p < 0.03). Alterations in Neer type occurred at 30 degrees of malrotation in 5 cases, with a change in recommended treatment in 2.ConclusionsHumeral angulation and offset measurements on AP radiographs are more susceptible to aberrant beam paths in fractured humeri. Altered radiographic beam paths around the vertical axis showed the most substantial influence on the assessment of PHF, with angular measurements demonstrating larger differences then offset measurements. Beam path alterations of 30 degrees can influence the Neer classification, and might influence fracture displacement-based decisions.

The potential of achieving such reductions under light sedation and local anesthesia has many potential benefits over general anesthesia and should therefore not be overlooked. The goal of this study was to verify if closed reduction under local anesthesia is a feasible alternative to reduction under general anesthesia for selected cases of orbitozygomatic complex fractures. Furthermore, an attempt was made at identifying those who would benefit from such an option without compromising end results as opposed to those who would require open reduction with the use of internal fixation devices (ORIF) to ensure favorable outcomes. Materials and Methods: Over the period of July to October 2005, we attempted to reduce 8 consecutive orbitozygomatic complex fractures on an outpatient basis with the use of local anesthesia. Results: We have successfully reduced 6 of 8 such fractures. Conclusion: Closed hook reduction under light sedation and local anesthesia is a feasible and safe procedure in selected cases of noncomminuted zygomatic fractures. Coupling both physical examination and immediate postoperative radiographic evaluation ensures substantiation of accurate reduction and permits immediate final corrections if considered necessary.

Management of acetabular fractures is challenging, especially when a medial acetabular fracture is complicated by central hip dislocation. We retrospectively investigated the clinical outcome and risk factors of secondary hip osteoarthritis requiring total hip arthroplasty after the surgical treatment of acetabular fractures with central hip dislocation. Materials and Methods. The medical records of all patients who had acetabular medial wall fractures with central hip dislocation treated with open reduction and internal fixation by a single surgeon between January 2015 and June 2017 were reviewed. Surgical reduction was performed with the modified Stoppa with/without the Kocher-Langenbeck (KL) approach. Patients were followed for a minimum of three years, and the Majeed scoring system was used for functional evaluation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association of patients' characteristics with the likelihood of advanced posttraumatic arthritis developing with conversion to total hip arthroplasty. Results. Fifty patients were included in this study, with disease classified as AO/OTA 2018 62B/62C. Thirty-five patients (70%) had good or excellent Majeed pelvic scores. Eleven patients (22%) eventually received total hip arthroplasty because of end-stage posttraumatic arthritis. Three risk factors identified for total hip arthroplasty were male sex, initial marginal impaction, and sciatic nerve injury. Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis estimated that the cumulative probability of free-from-end-stage arthritis was 78% (95% confidence interval, 73%-90%) at the 5-year follow-up. Conclusion. Surgical fixation with the modified Stoppa and the KL approach for acetabular medial wall fractures with central hip dislocation is an effective approach with a satisfactory functional outcome. A prodromal factor was marginal impaction concomitant with articular damage. The trauma of high axial loading and the occupational distribution (males performing heavy manual labor and heavy lifting) with preoperative sciatic nerve injury increased the odds of developing end-stage arthritis.

Material/Methods: Thirty patients (age, 40-71 years) with ossification of the ligamentum flavum of the thoracic spine underwent SLPF (13 men, 17 women). Operative time, intraoperative blood loss, preoperative and postoperative change in thoracic kyphosis, and perioperative complications were recorded. The Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score for severity of myelopathy and the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor and sensory impairment scale were used before and after surgery. Results: Mean operative time for SLPF was 208.4 +/- 38.3 min and mean intraoperative blood loss was 689.3 +/- 171.7 ml. The mean JOA score significantly increased from 5.7 +/- 1.9 before surgery to 8.8 +/- 2.2 at one month after surgery and 9.3 +/- 2.7 at the last follow-up (P<0.01). Postoperative improvement in neurological function increased by 68.3 +/- 14.4%. The postoperative ASIA grades significantly improved compared with the preoperative grades (P<0.01). The mean local Cobb angle significantly decreased from 17.8 +/- 4.3 degrees before surgery to 15.4 +/- 3.6 degrees at one month after surgery and 15.8 +/- 3.8 degrees at the last follow-up (P<0.01). Three patients (10%) had operative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. Postoperatively, one patient had neurological deterioration, two patients had deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and one patient developed a wound infection. Conclusions: SLPF was an effective procedure for the treatment of ossification of the ligamentum flavum of the thoracic spine.

This young patient suffered from Noonan's Syndrome that is a complex hereditary malformation syndrome with clinical features often leading to spinal deformities and gibbus development. The defect originated from a former internal vertebral fixation that was necessary for erective correction of such a spinal deformity. After perforation of the introduced material and debridement the defect was 4 X 8 cm in size, which was successfully closed by the free latissimus dorsi transfer. However, two venous grafts were necessary because the extension of the pedicled muscle was not sufficient to reach the defect. This is the first case in literature where a free flap was used with two venous grafts to close a soft tissue defect of the spine in the special case of a vertebral deformity based on a Noonan's Syndrome.

Materials and methods We retrospective reviewed 12 consecutive patients with recalcitrant distal femoral nonunion undergoing our three-stage treatment protocol from January 2010 to December 2014 in our institute. The three-stage treatment protocol comprised debridement of the nonunion site, lengthening to eliminate leg length discrepancy, deformity correction, stabilization with a locked plate, filling of the defect with cement spacer for inducing membrane formation, and bone reconstruction using a cancellous bone autograft (Masquelet technique) or free vascularized fibular bone graft. The bone union time, wound complication, lower limbs alignment, amount of lengthening, knee range of motion, and functional outcomes were evaluated. Results Osseous union with angular deformity <5 degrees and leg length discrepancy <1 cm were achieved in all the patients. The average amount of lengthening was 5.88 cm (range 3.5-12 cm). Excellent or good outcomes were obtained in 9 patients. Conclusions Although the current study involved only a small number of patients and the intervention comprised three stages, we believe that such a protocol may be a valuable alternative for the treatment of recalcitrant distal femoral nonunion.

HAp was firstly prepared by a co-precipitation method using calcium hydroxide and phosphoric acid and then shaped as a rectangular porous template. PEA precursor was synthesized by bulk polymerization of dimethyl adipate and ethylene glycol in the presence of tetraisopropyl orthotitanate. C-OEA was obtained by cyclo-depolymerization of the PEA precursor under high dilution condition using dibutyl tinoxide as a catalyst. The HAp/PEA composites were prepared by immersing the porous HAp templates in the mixture solution of C-OEA and dibutyl tinoxide catalyst overnight and ring-opening polymerizing at 180, 200 and 220 degrees C for 24 h. The ning-opening polymerized PEA formed as a thin film coating on the surface of porous HAp template. The HAp/PEA composites contained PEA in the range of 20-26 wt%. The weight-average molecular weights of ring-opening polymerized PEA were in the range of 3800-4450 g/mol. Compressive strength of the HAp/PEA composite was significantly increased from 25 MPa in the porous HAp template to 140 MPa in the composite.

Relative deficiencies of different nutrients with respect to biological requirements, within both surface and internal water masses, can be both a key indicator and driver of the potential for these nutrients to become limiting for the production of new organic material in the upper ocean. The availability of high-quality, full-depth and global-scale datasets on the concentrations of a wide range of both macro-and micro-nutrients produced through the international GEOTRACES programme provides the potential for estimation of multi-element deficiencies at unprecedented scales. Resultant coherent large-scale patterns in diagnosed deficiency can be linked to the interacting physical-chemical-biological processes which drive upper ocean nutrient biogeochemistry. Calculations of ranked deficiencies across multiple elements further highlight important remaining uncertainties in the stoichiometric plasticity of nutrient ratios within oceanic microbial systems and caveats with regards to linkages to upper ocean nutrient limitation.

This study compares construct stiffness, cycles to failure and failure load between a retrograde slotted femur nail construct docked to a THA stem and a lateral locking plate in a human periprosthetic femur fracture model. Materials and methods: In seven pairs of fresh-frozen human anatomic femora with cemented THA, a transverse osteotomy was set simulating a Vancouver type B1 fracture. The femora were instrumented pairwise with either a retrograde slotted nail coupled to the prosthesis stem, or a locking plate plus a locking attachment plate. Four-point mediolateral bending, torsional and axial bending construct stiffness was investigated via non-destructive tests. Cyclic testing under progressively increasing physiologic loading was performed at 2 Hz until catastrophic construct failure. Results: Mediolateral bending stiffness did not differ significantly between the two groups (P=0.17) but exhibited a biphasic profile with significantly increased stiffness in both groups (P<0.01). Nail constructs provided a significantly lower torsional stiffness (0.49 +/- 0.66 Nm/degrees) than plate constructs (1.70 +/- 0.86 Nm/degrees), P=0.03. Axial bending stiffness did not differ significantly between the groups (Nail: 605 +/- 511 N/mm; Plate: 381 +/- 428 N/mm), P=0.61. Cycles to failure and failure load were significantly higher for the plate constructs (25'700 +/- 8'341; 3'070 +/- 1334 N) compared with the nail constructs (20'729 +/- 7'949; 2'573 +/- 1295 N), P=0.04. Conclusion: The docking nail construct provides an intramedullary fixation with connection to the prosthesis stem; however, it is biomechanically weaker in stable fractures compared to the plate construct.

Complications of implant removal after healed hip fractures	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Femoral neck fracture; Hardware removal; Implant; Internal fixation; Pertrochanteric fracture; Complication	FEMORAL-NECK FRACTURES; HARDWARE; FIXATION	Introduction Osteosynthesis of pertrochanteric fractures is one of the most frequently performed procedures in orthopaedic trauma care. Auto-dynamization during fracture healing can lead to lateralization of the screw or blade. This can cause debilitating complaints, which sometimes necessitate the removal of the screw or blade. After removal of the implant, we observed spontaneous femoral neck fractures in five patients. This article presents an evaluation of these cases with reference to literature. Materials and methods Five cases of spontaneous femoral neck fracture (SFNF) after cephalomedullary nail removal are described. A literature search was performed on the incidence of chronic pain and gait impairment associated with auto-dynamization, and on risk factors for dynamization and complications after implant removal. Based on these findings recommendations are made for the prevention of SFNF. Results Over a 2-year period, we observed five cases of SFNF after cephalomedullary nail removal. In literature, reduced mobility, gait impairment and chronic pain are associated with screw or blade dynamization. Pertrochanteric fractures with AO-type 2 classification were associated with more dynamization and screw lateralization and henceforth more trochanteric pain and gait disturbances. SFNF after cephalomedullary nail removal occurs with an incidence of at least 15%, affecting mostly elderly patients. This severe complication mostly occurs within 3 weeks after implant removal. Risk factors associated with SFNF are pre-existing systemic osteoporosis, stress-shielding, pre-loading of the implant and nail removal of the cephalomedullary implant. Conclusion The clinical indications for implant removal in healed pertrochanteric fractures are not well established and should be restricted to specific cases. After removal of these implants without replacement partial weight-bearing should be advised strictly. Based on our findings it is recommended to replace the cephalomedullary nail with a shorter one, ideally combined with implant augmentation.	[Driessen, M. L. S.; Goessens, M. L. M.

For prevention of this deformity, different techniques are used in combination with inferior pedicle. In this study, we aimed to prevent bottoming-out deformity by producing an internal bra effect through combination of inferior pedicle technique with 2 superior and 2 inferior dermal flaps that were raised from each side of the pedicle. Methods: Thirteen patients whose medical records became available during the follow-up period at Ankara Training and Research Hospital from January 2010 to January 2015 were included in this study. We retrospectively obtained patient medical records including demographic characteristics and clinical data. Superior dermal flaps were planned on both sides of the pedicle 2 cm inferior to the lower border of areola and inferior dermal flaps were planned 6 cm inferior to the superior dermal flaps. The superior and inferior dermal flaps were secured to the periosteum of the 2nd and 4th ribs respectively with permanent sutures. Results: Preoperatively, the average distance between the inframammary fold and areola was 13.9 cm (range, 11-18 cm). The average amount of breast parenchymal resection was 745 g (range, 612-1,496 g). The average distance between the inframammary fold and the lower border of the areola was 7.9 cm (range, 7.5-9,cm) on the postoperative first-year measurements. Conclusion: In conclusion, according to our study, suspension technique to prevent bottoming-out deformity is associated with an easier technique without the need for alloplastic or allogenic materials. Since fixation is performed to the ribs instead of soft tissues like the pectoral fascia or muscle, we believe that this fixation is more long lasting and can be an effective alternative to other suspension techniques.

Influence of plate-bone contact on cyclically loaded conically coupled locking plate failure	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Biomechanical; Cyclic; Locking plate; Fracture; Cadaver; Conical coupling; Plate-bone contact; Screw cutout	DYNAMIC COMPRESSION PLATE; CANINE CORTICAL BONE; BIOMECHANICAL PROPERTIES; INTERNAL FIXATORS; FIXATION; CORROSION; IMPLANTS; STABILITY; LCP	Introduction: The maintenance of friction between locking plates and bone is not essential, so that they can be applied with a gap between the plate and underlying bone. We hypothesised that the presence of a gap under a locking plate with a conical coupling mechanism would reduce fixation stability or allow uncoupling of the locking screws from the plate. Materials and methods: Locking plates with two conically coupled locking screws were applied to 6 pairs of adult canine femora. One of each pair had plate to bone contact and the contralateral construct had a 2 mm plate to bone gap. Constructs were cyclically loaded in cantilever bending with 10 percent incremental increases every 1000 cycles at 2 Hz, starting at 250 N. The constructs were fatigued to failure. To evaluate fatigue life of the conical coupling, testing was repeated with aluminium tubing replacing the bone, to eliminate screw-bone cutout failure. Results: The mean sustained loads and cycles to failure in the contact group (420.80, standard error [ SE] 14.97 N; 7612.00, SE 574.70 cycles) were significantly greater than in the gap group (337.50, SE 14.97 N; 4252.00, SE 574.70 cycles), (p < 0.001). Failure mode of all bone constructs was via screw cutout from the bone. Aluminium tubing constructs failed via screw or plate fatigue and breaking, with one construct having elevation of the plate over the screw head. Discussion and conclusions: Elevation of locking plates with a conical coupling system by 2 mm from the bone reduced construct fatigue life but did not result in screw head uncoupling from the plate.

AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE			English	Article						trauma; meniscus replacement; roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA); polymer	ALLOGRAFT; REPAIR; RECONSTRUCTION; MENISCECTOMY; DOG	Meniscus replacement by a polymer meniscus prosthesis in dogs resulted in generation of new meniscal tissue. Hypothesis: Optimal functioning of the prosthesis would involve realistic deformation and motion patterns of the prosthesis during knee joint motion. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: The movements of the meniscus were determined during knee joint flexion and extension with and without internal and external tibial torque by means of roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis. Subsequently, the meniscus in 6 human cadaveric knee joints was replaced by a meniscus prosthesis. Results: All different parts of the meniscus showed a posterior displacement during knee joint flexion. The anterior horn was more mobile than the posterior horn. The prosthesis mimicked the movements of the meniscus. However, the excursions of the prosthesis on the tibial plateau were less. The knee joint laxity was not significantly higher after replacement with the meniscus prosthesis. Conclusions: The prosthesis approximated the behavior of the native meniscus. Improvement in both the gliding characteristics of the prosthetic material and the fixation of the prosthesis may improve the function. Clinical Relevance: The meniscus prosthesis needs to be optimized to achieve a better initial function in the knee joint.

During stabilization and carbonization, however, the morphology of pristine PAN nanofibers is not retained if the as-spun nanofiber mats are treated without an external mechanical force, since internal stress tends to relax, causing the whole mats to shrink significantly, while the individual fibers thicken and curl. Stretching the nanofiber mats during thermal treatment, in contrast, can result in fractures due to inhomogeneous stress. Previous studies have shown that stabilization and carbonization of PAN nanofibers electrospun on an aluminum substrate are efficient methods to retain the fiber mat dimensions without macroscopic cracks during heat treatment. In this work, we studied different procedures of mechanical fixation via metallic substrates during thermal treatment. The influence of the metallic substrate material as well as different methods of double-sided covering of the fibers, i.e., sandwiching, were investigated. The results revealed that sandwich configurations with double-sided metallic supports not only facilitate optimal preservation of the original fiber morphology but also significantly accelerate the carbonization process. It was found that unlike regularly carbonized nanofibers, the metal supports allow complete deoxygenation at low treatment temperature and that the obtained carbon nanofibers exhibit increased crystallinity.

The change of intrinsic viscosity, thermal properties, inner structure, bending strength reduction, surface morphology and the surface deposit of n-HA/PLGA composite and pure PLGA with respect to the soaking time were investigated by means of UbbeloHde Viscometer, differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), scanning electron microscope(SEM), electromechanical universal tester, a conventional camera and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that n-HA played an important role in improving the degradation behavior of n-HA/PLGA composite, which can accelerate the degradation PLGA and endow it with bioactivity, after n-HA was detached from PLGA during the degradation, so that n-HA/PLGA composite may have a more promising prospect of the clinical application than pure PLGA as bone fracture internal fixation materials.

Hot processing is a necessary step for obtaining HAp/PLLA composite blocks with mechanical properties similar to those of bones. In this article, the changes in structure and physicochemical properties of HAp/PLLA composite, hot pressed for different pressing times (5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min), were studied. Because the morphology of HAp/PLLA composite biomaterial is very sensitive to this procedure, its surface microstructure was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector system. Structural changes occurring in the material, mostly changes in crystallinity of PLLA, were studied by wide-angle X-ray structural analyses (WAXS) and infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and gel permeation chromatography (GPC), the influence of hot pressing on the properties, crystallization kinetics, and decomposition of HAp/PLLA composite biomaterial was analyzed.

Factors affecting accurate drill sleeve insertion in locking compression plates	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Locking compression plate; Drill sleeve; Locking screw; Internal fixation; Osteosynthesis	LESS INVASIVE STABILIZATION; FRACTURES; REMOVAL; SCREW; LCP	Background: Accurate positioning of locking screws depends on accurate insertion of the drill sleeve into the locking compression plate (LCP). The purpose of the present study was to determine factors affecting accurate drill sleeve insertion. Hypothesis: Tilting and shallow locking screw holes and combination-type holes make it difficult to insert the drill sleeve in the LCP. Materials and methods: Twenty-seven 3.5 mm LCP metaphyseal insertion holes were selected (Philos (R), LPHP (R), DMTP (R), low-band DMTP (R) [Synthes, Solothurn, Switzerland]). Two orthopedic surgeons checked the time taken for accurate insertion of the drill sleeve into the plate. Variables relating to LCP drill sleeve insertion time were analyzed. Results: It took an average 6.6 seconds to insert the drill sleeve accurately in the holes. Insertion time increased with the tilt of the screw hole but not with shallowness. Insertion time in combination-type holes was longer (8.8 seconds) than in single locking holes (5.6 seconds). Discussion: Tilted screw holes and combination-type holes affect the insertion of the drill sleeve into 3.5 mm LCPs. Level of evidence: Level IV, experimental study. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Materials and methods: Between November 2010 and February 2012, six cases of elderly complex tibial plateau fractures were treated with primary TKA using the standard medial parapatellar approach. All six patients were available at follow up with mean duration of 32.3 months (range 25-41 months). There were 3 women and 3 men with an average age of 69.5 years (58-78 years) at the time of the arthroplasty. Results: The mean Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) knee score was 89.8 (range 85-94): 6/6 excellent. The mean knee flexion was 119.2 degrees (105-130 degrees). No significant postoperative complications were noted. None of these patients had significant postoperative knee pain required revision surgery, or had radiographic loosening of the components at the latest follow-up. Conclusions: TKA is a suitable solution for the treatment of elderly patients with complex tibial plateau fractures.

Hip arthroplasty is a good salvage procedure even though it involves technical issues such as implant removal, bone loss, poor bone quality, trochanteric nonunion and difficulty of surgical exposure. Materials and Methods: 30 patients of failed intertrochanteric fractures where hip arthroplasty was done between May 2008 and December 2011 were included in study. 13 were males and 17 were females with average age of 67.3 years. There were 2 cemented bipolar arthroplasties, 19 uncemented bipolar, 4 cemented total hip arthroplasty and 5 uncemented total hip arthroplasties. 16 patients had a trochanteric nonunion, which was treated by tension band principles. Total hip was considered where there was acetabular damage due to the penetration of implant. Results: The average followup was 20 months (range 6-48 months). Patients were followed up from 6 to 48 months with average followup of 20 months. None of the patients were lost to followup. There was no dislocation. All patients were ambulatory at the final followup. Conclusion: A predictable functional outcome can be achieved by hip arthroplasty in elderly patients with failed intertrochanteric fractures. Though technically demanding, properly performed hip arthroplasty can be a good salvage option for this patient group.

In the present paper, the formation of a hydroxyapatite/ chitosan ( HA/CS) hybrid nanocomposite is described and a general design strategy for immunosensing platforms is proposed on the basis of HA/CS nanocomposite and nanogold particle adsorption of antibodies. A quartz crystal microbalance used as a model transducer and the detection performances of the resulting immunosensor were investigated by using the immuno-system of CA125, an important indicator in the diagnosis of clinical cancers. The hybrid nanocomposite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy measurements. The frequency response characteristics for the processes of immobilization and immunoreaction of anchored anti-CA125 antibodies were studied in detail. It was found that the developed sensing interface has some advantages, such as activation-free immobilization and high antigen-binding activities of antibodies. The as-prepared immunosensor can allow the determination of CA125 in the concentration range 15.3-440.0 U mL(-1). Such an interface design with the hybrid nanocomposite could be tailored as a new alternative used for biosensor design.

An analytical classification of fractures of the distal radius:: The "MEU" classification	CHIRURGIE DE LA MAIN			English	Article						distal radius fracture; classification system	ARTICULAR FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; COLLES FRACTURES; OPEN REDUCTION; END; DISPLACEMENT; INSTABILITY; PREDICTION	Introduction. - Fractures of the distal radius are often complex injuries involving to a varying degree the radial metaphysis (M), radial epiphysis (E) and distal ulna (U). The association of these three parameters varies in a given injury and each fracture is a specific lesion which often defies inclusion in a well-defined group. An analytical classification is proposed. Materials and methods. - The classification system analysed the three components of the fracture, assigning to each an index of gravity increasing from 0 to 4 and taking into account the main prognostic factor. Interobserver and intraobserver evaluation was carried out. The system was a posteriori applied to a prospective series of 166 distal radius fractures. Results. - Mean interobserver reliability was 0.78 and mean intraobserver reproducibility 0.81.M and E were closely correlated with treatment, M with algodystrophy, E with pain and U with mobility and patient satisfaction at one year. Conclusions. - Inter- and intraobserver reproducibilities were good and the results validated our gravity indexes. This classification, describing all possible combinations of the three components of the fracture, is useful for both prognosis and treatment. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. Tons droits reserves.

Dual-mobility (DM) THA might reduce the dislocation risk. We aim to report the dislocation and revision rate of primary DM THA in patients with displaced FNF. Materials and methods Between 2005 and 2015, 966 consecutive patients (676 women) at mean age 80.5years (range 42-104) with displaced FNF were operated with DM articulation THA by posterolateral approach (PLA). Patient files and radiographs were evaluated for dislocations, revisions, and other complications until death of the patient or August 1st, 2017. Data were crosschecked with the National Patient Registry. Patient's mental state was tested upon admissions. Surgeon's educational level was noted and post-operative cup position was measured. Results At minimum 1.6-year follow-up, there were 45 (4.7%) dislocations and eight (0.8%) cup revisions. The 30-day mortality was 9.2% and 533 patients (55.2%) were dead at the time of last follow-up. We observed eight intraprosthetic dislocations (IPD); six occurred in relation to closed reduction. Cementless stem fixation was associated with higher dislocation risk (p = 0.04) and higher rate of stem complications (p = 0.002). There was no significant association between cognitive impairment and dislocation (OR 2.0, 95% CI 0.96-4.34, p = 0.06). Conclusion Overall, DM THA inserted via PLA results in an acceptable dislocation risk and low revision rate in fragile, old patients with acute FNF fracture, regardless of mental status. A unique complication in DM THA is IPD, which requires an immediate open reduction surgery.

Is there a role for intramedullary nails in the treatment of simple pilon fractures? Rationale and preliminary results	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Tibia; Plafond; Pilon; Fracture; Intramedullary nail; Articular; AO/OTA type 43C	DISTAL TIBIAL FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; METAPHYSEAL FRACTURES; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; SHAFT FRACTURES; PLATE	Introduction: Certain patients with pilon fractures present with significant soft-tissue swelling or with a poor soft-tissue envelope typically not amenable to definitive fixation in the early time period. The objective of this study was to review the treatment of simple intra-articular fractures of the tibial plafond (Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen/Orthopaedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA) type 43C1-C2) via intramedullary nailing (IMN) with the assessment of clinical and radiographic results and any associated complications. Materials and methods: Retrospective clinical and radiological reviews of 31 patients sustaining AO/OTA type 43C distal tibial fractures treated with IMN were evaluated. Our main outcome measurement included achievable alignment in the immediate postoperative period and at the time of union along with complications or need for secondary procedures within the first year of follow-up. Results: Seven patients were lost to follow-up. All the remaining patients achieved bony union at a mean union time of 14.1 +/- 4.9 weeks with no evidence of malunion or malrotation. All patients were at full-weight-bearing status at 1-year follow-up. Complications were notable for one delayed union, one nonunion, one patient with superficial wound drainage, two with deep infection, one with symptomatic hardware and one with deep vein thrombosis. Conclusion: Simple articular fractures of the tibial plafond (AO/OTA type 43C) treated via IMN can achieve excellent alignment and union rates with proper patient selection and surgical indication. One should not hesitate to use additional bone screws or plating options to help achieve better anatomic reduction. However, larger, prospective randomised trials comparing plating versus nailing, in experienced hands, are needed to completely delineate the utility of this treatment modality.

A Synthetic Bone Biomechanical Research in the Internal Fixation of Vertical Femoral Neck Fracture	BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							HIP SCREWS; PLATE	Purpose. The purpose of this study is to verify whether the headless cannulated compression screw (HCCS) has higher biomechanical stability than the ordinary cannulated compression screw (OCCS) in the treatment of vertical femoral neck fractures. Materials and Methods. 30 synthetic femur models were equally divided into 2 groups, with 50 degrees, 60 degrees, and 70 degrees Pauwels angle of femoral neck fracture, under 3D printed guiding plates and C-arm fluoroscopic guidance. The femur molds were fixed with three parallel OCCSs as OCCS group and three parallel HCCSs as HCCS group. All specimens were tested for compressive strength and maximum load to failure with a loading rate of 2 mm/min. Results. The result showed that there was no significant difference with the compressive strength in the Pauwels angle of 50 degrees and 60 degrees. However, we observed that the maximum load to failure with the Pauwels angle of 50 degrees, 60 degrees, and 70 degrees and the compressive strength with 70 degrees of HCCS group showed better performance than the OCCS group. Conclusion. HCCS performs with better biomechanical stability than OCCS in the treatment of vertical femoral neck fracture, especially with the Pauwels angle of 70 degrees.

METHODS: Thirty-two male Wistar rats were divided into control and experimental groups. In the control group the rats were submitted to a mandibular fracture, which was reduced, and the soft tissues were sutured. In the experimental group the rats had the mandibular fracture reduced and maintained with the Portland cement. The animals were euthanized 7 and 21 days after surgery by injecting a lethal dose of anesthetic. The following variables were studied: weight of the animals, radiographic images, histopathological features and time of surgery. RESULTS: A weight loss was observed in the specimens of both groups at the different times of evaluation, a greater difference in weight before and after surgery being found in the experimental group, which was statistically significant (p <0.05, p = 0.041). From the histological point of view, with a margin of error (5.0%) the only two significant differences (p <0.05) recorded in the variables were "Material deployed" and "Bone resorption" during the evaluations at 7 and 21 days, respectively. CONCLUSION: The Portland cement served to promote bone healing.

Despite its prevalence, clinicians know little about the extent of its impact on orofacial manifestations. Materials and Methods: All patients with diagnoses of mandible fracture and sickle cell anemia admitted from 2004 through 2014 were identified using the National Inpatient Sample. Patient demographics, fracture regions, and complications were characterized by descriptive statistics. Results: Fifty-one of 48,464 patients admitted for mandible fracture had sickle cell anemia. The mean age of the identified patients was 25 years (range, 4 to 58 yr). Of all admitted patients, mandible angle fracture was the most common (19%), followed by fracture of the body of the mandible. Seventy-five percent of cases reviewed were treated with open reduction and internal fixation. Conclusions: Most mandible fractures in patients with sickle cell anemia were located in the angle of the mandible. Complications were minimal and outcomes were satisfactory Aseptic necrosis of the jaw was a frequent complication of mandible fracture in patients with sickle cell anemia. These results provide clinicians with a better understanding of the distribution and hospital course of patients with sickle cell anemia and facial fractures.

The bamboo yarn has merits like air permeability, biodegradability, and excellent heat dissipation performance, but it has not been prepared for responsive materials and smart textiles. In this paper, the moisture-responsive twisted bamboo yarns were plied to form a self-balanced torsional actuator and wrapped around a mandrel to form a coil, followed by water immersion and evaporation to fix the shape and serve as a tensile actuator. A torsional actuation of 64.4 degrees. mm(-1) was realized for the twisted actuator in 4.2 s; a maximum elongation of 133% or contraction of 50% was achieved for a coiled tensile actuator with good cyclability. The porous structure of bamboo yarns helped improve the water absorbance speed and decrease the response time of moisture. The self-balanced two-ply physical structure and reversible generation of chemical phase after soaking in aqueous solution fixed internal stress and provided good cyclability. With the unique properties including aqueous water-induced shape fixation and moisture-induced actuation, the application of tensile actuation of bamboo yarns was demonstrated, showing promising prospects on smart textiles.

The various types of adult proximal femoral fractures require different treatment strategies that depend on a variety of considerations, including the location, morphologic features, injury mechanism, and stability of the fracture, as well as the patient's age and baseline functional status. The authors discuss femoral head, femoral neck, intertrochanteric, and subtrochanteric fractures in terms of injury mechanisms, specific anatomic and biomechanical features, and important diagnostic and management considerations, including the diagnostic utility of imaging modalities. The authors review clinically important classification systems, such as the Pipkin, Garden, Pauwels, and Evans-Jensen classification systems, with emphasis on differentiating subchondral insufficiency fractures from avascular necrosis of the femoral head and typical subtrochanteric fractures from atypical (often bisphosphonate-related) subtrochanteric fractures. In addition, the authors describe the potential complications and management strategies for each fracture type on the basis of the patient's age and physical condition. A clear understanding of these considerations allows the radiologist to better provide appropriate and relevant diagnostic information and management guidance to the orthopedic surgeon.

Tetracycline labeling as a measure of humeral head viability after 3-or 4-part proximal humerus fracture	JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY			English	Article						Proximal humerus fracturel; avascular necrosis; tetracycline labeling; hemiarthroplasty; three-part; four-part	INTERNAL-FIXATION; RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATION; BONE-HISTOLOGY; FEMORAL-HEAD; 3-PART; HEMIARTHROPLASTY; CLASSIFICATION; VASCULARITY; NECROSIS; BIOPSY	Hypothesis: Specifically located humeral head biopsies from three-part proximal humerus fractures taken at the time of hemiarthroplasty will show greater tetracycline labeling under fluorescent microscopy than those biopsies taken from four-part fractures. Additionally, biopsies from younger patients would show greater fluorescence than older patients. Material and methods: Nineteen consecutive adult patients (range 43-83 years) underwent hemiarthroplasty as definitive treatment for 20 displaced three- and four-part proximal humerus fractures after having received 500mg of tetracycline hydrochloride orally every six hours for the immediate five preoperative days. Humeral head biopsies were taken from four pre-determined locations intraoperatively. The biopsies were prepared and analyzed with fluorescent microscopy. Results: All specimens in each biopsy location demonstrated fluorescence. There was no difference between the mean rank gray values for the four biopsy locations (p = 0.78 with the Friedman test). There was no difference between the mean rank gray values for the four biopsy locations when analyzed according to three-part vs four-part fracture (p > 0.05 with the Mann-Whitney test). There was an inverse relationship between age and fluorescence for the anterosuperior biopsy location (p = 0.033 with Spearman correlation). Discussion: Vascular supply is preserved in displaced three- and four-part proximal humerus fractures. With intact vascularity to the humeral head, head-preserving techniques utilizing stable, site-specific fixation and minimal dissection should be considered in the treatment of displaced three- and four-part proximal humerus fractures Conclusion: Vascular supply is preserved in displaced three- and four-part proximal humerus fractures, especially in younger patients in the anterosuperior aspect of the humeral head.

Juxtaarticular giant cell tumours of the lower end radius are common and present a special problem of reconstruction after tumour excision. Out of the various reconstructive procedures described, non-vascularised fibular autograft has been widely used with satisfactory functional results. Materials and Methods: Ten patients with a mean age of 33.4 years, with either Campanacci grade II or III histologically proven giant cell tumours of lower end radius were treated with wide excision and reconstruction with ipsilateral non-vascularised proximal fibular autograft. Host graft junction was fixed with dynamic compression plate (DCP) in all cases. Wrist ligament reconstruction and fixation of the head of the fibula with carpal bones and distal end of the ulna using K-wires and primary cancellous iliac crest grafting at graft host junction was done in all cases. Results: The follow-up ranged from 30 to 60 months (mean, 46.8). At last follow-up, the average combined range of motion was 100.5 degrees with range varying from 60 degrees to 125 degrees. The average union time was 7 months (range, 4 to 12). Non-union occurred in 1 case. Graft resorption occurred in another case. Localised soft tissue recurrence occurred in another case after 3 years and was treated by excision. There was no case of graft fracture, metastasis, death, local recurrence or significant donor site morbidity. A total of 3 secondary procedures were required. Conclusions: Enbloc resection of giant cell tumours of the lower end radius is a widely accepted method. Reconstruction with non-vascularised fibular graft, internal fixation with DCP with primary corticocancellous bone grafting with transfixation of the fibular head and wrist ligament reconstruction minimises the problem and gives satisfactory functional results.

The feasibility of isolation method and characterization of Mesenchymal stem cell including growth kinetics, immunophenotypes and differentiation potency from small volume aspiration harvested from ulna and radius should be evaluated in order to utilize this cell in hand surgery. Materials and methods: Mesenchymal stem cells were isolated and characterized from bone marrow of 12 patients who underwent internal fixation of fractures at radius or ulna. Population doubling time & clonogenic ability, immunophenotypes and trilineage differentiation potential of Mesenchymal stem cells were evaluated. Results: Mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow were attached to plastic flasks and became homogenous monolayer of fibroblast-like cells. They exhibited clonogenic ability and demonstrated positive markers which were shown by CD 73, CD 90, and CD 105 and negative markers which were shown by CD 34, CD 45. Mesenchymal stem cells derived from this source were capable of osteogenesis, chondrogenesis and adipogenesis.

A pilot clinical trial	INTERNATIONAL ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article							PERIODONTAL OSSEOUS DEFECTS; CELL-BINDING; MATRIX; ABM	Treatment of non-unions and delayed unions often requires osteogenic material. Recently, a biomimetic bone matrix that simulates the cellular environment of hard tissue, identified as P-15, was introduced to the orthopaedic community. A total of 22 patients with mal-union or delayed union fractures was treated from June 2000 to October 2003 with P15- bone graft substitute (P15-BGS) in the site of fracture and mostly with internal fixation. Patients were examined by independent radiographic analysis. Assessment criteria included time elapsed until bone bridging and time to full consolidation. In addition, histological assessment of the callus was done at the time of recovery of metal implants in five patients. Full consolidation was achieved in 90% (20 out of 22) of the patients treated with P15-BGS. The average time for full consolidation was 4.2 months. Histological assessment of the fracture callus in five of the patients confirmed the positive clinical and radiographic results. P15-BGS appears to offer a safe, economical and clinically useful alternative to autograft in the repair of ununited fractures. These results compare favourably with those in the published literature as an alternative to autograft.

ACTA ODONTOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Article						Antibiotics; mandible; surgical site infection; trauma	INTERNAL-FIXATION; COMPLICATIONS; ANTIBIOTICS; MANAGEMENT; DIATHERMY; TEETH	Objective To evaluate the occurrence of surgical site infections and predisposing factors for these in simple mandibular fractures. Material and Methods A retrospective study of patients with fractures of the dentate part of the mandible included patients with intraorally treated simple fractures of the mandibular body, symphysis, and parasymphysis. The primary outcome variable was postoperative surgical site infection. Use of antibiotics, injury mechanism, fracture and surgery-related explanatory variables, patient-related variables and level of oral hygiene according to the modified Total Dental Index were evaluated. Results Of 254 patients with mandibular fractures, 107 were included in the final analysis. The infection group consisted of 18 patients (16.8%). Despite the high infection occurrence, significant differences were not found between antibiotic use or other studied variables and infection occurrence. Infections occurred mainly in patients without any specific explanatory factor for infection. Conclusion The notably high occurrence of surgical site infections despite antibiotic use after simple mandibular fracture surgery highlights the importance of perioperative tissue handling and local oral circumstances. It is also necessary to consider whether we generally accept the high risk of infection associated with the intraorally treated simple mandibular fractures.

The current treatment of choice is symphyseal plating, which requires extensive surgery and entirely limits physiological movement of the symphyseal joint, frequently resulting in implant failure. Therefore, we investigated the biomechanical properties of a semi-rigid implant (modified SpeedBridge((TM))) as a minimally invasive tape suture construct for the treatment of open book fractures and evaluated the superiority of two techniques of implementation: criss-cross vs. triangle technique. Materials and methods Nine synthetic symphyseal joints were dissected creating an open book fracture. The different osteosynthesis methods (plating, modified SpeedBridge((TM)) in criss-cross/triangle technique) were then applied. All constructs underwent horizontal and vertical loading, simulating biomechanical forces while sitting, standing and walking. For statistical analysis, dislocation (mm) and stiffness (N/mm) were calculated. Results Symphyseal plating for the treatment of open book fractures proved to be a rigid osteosynthesis significantly limiting the physiological mobility of the symphyseal joint (dislocation: 0.08 +/- 0.01 mm) compared to the tape sutures (dislocation: triangle technique 0.27 +/- 0.07 mm, criss-cross technique 0.23 +/- 0.05 mm) regarding horizontal tension (p < 0.01). Both modified SpeedBridge((TM)) techniques showed sufficient biomechanical stability without one being superior to the other (p > 0.05 in all directions). Considering vertical loading, no statistical difference was found between all osteosynthesis methods (caudal: p = 0.41; cranial: p = 0.61). Conclusions Symphyseal plating proved to be the osteosynthesis method with the highest rigidity. The modified SpeedBridge((TM)) as a semi-rigid suture construct provided statistically sufficient biomechanical stability while maintaining a minimum of symphyseal movement, consequently allowing ligamental healing of the injured joint without iatrogenic arthrodesis. Furthermore, both the criss-cross and the triangle technique displayed significant biomechanical stability without one method being superior.

Guidelines for removal, preservation, and CT imaging of the syrinx, the avian vocal organ	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY			English	Article						collections; diceCT; dissection; imaging; morphology; vocal communication	COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY DICECT; IODINE; MORPHOLOGY; SHRINKAGE; EVOLUTION; TRACT	While the state of the art has been described for recording bird songs and calls, there are no described best practices for collecting and preserving the avian vocal organ, the syrinx. In addition to skins and skeletal preparations, field collection of tissues for DNA sequencing has become a common practice. Protocols for such tissue collection often involve accessing internal organs. Here we argue that collecting syringes, which also involves accessing the chest cavity, adds only minimal time to field or skeletal preparation and can be done without damage to the skeleton. Collecting syringes will enable studies of structure-function relationships in the production of calls and song that have not been previously possible. Three-dimensional X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging techniques allow new insight into these relationships, but material of both male and female birds as well as juveniles is lacking for most avian taxa. Here, we present a guide to the removal and preservation of the avian syrinx and associated vocal anatomy in hopes of increasing their representation in biological collections. In this guide, we suggest that taking in situ measurements is ideal since dissection, fixation, and tissue staining can affect measurements of certain airway features such as tracheal diameter and bronchial length. Our guidelines demonstrate that removing a single wing, shoulder, and half of the pectoral girdle from the dorsal side of the thorax along with disarticulating the sternal and vertebral rib segments on one side of the body allows exposure of the complete airway without damaging the skeleton. We also provide recommendations for fixation, storage, and staining of specimens in preparation for diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed tomography (diceCT) scans that allow imaging of both soft tissue structures such as vocal folds and muscles as well as the cartilaginous rings that support these structures.

Aim of surgical treatment is to achieve painless stable plantigrade foot through arthrodesis. Achieving surgical arthrodesis in Charcots neuroarthropathy has a high failure rate. This is a retrospective nonrandomized comparative study assessing the outcomes of tibio-talar arthrodesis for Charcots neuroarthropathy treated by uniplanar external fixation assisted by external immobilization or retrograde intramedullary interlocked nailing. Materials and Methods: Records of the authors institution were reviewed to identify those patients who had undergone ankle fusion for diabetic neuroarthropathy from January 1998 to December 2008. A total of11 patients (six males and five females) with a mean age of 56 year and diabetes of a mean duration of 15.4 years with ankle tibio-talar arthrodesis using retrograde nailing or external fixator for Charcots neuroarthropathy were enrolled for the analysis. Neuropathy was clinically diagnosed, documented and substantiated using the monofilament test. All procedures were performed in Eichenholz stage II/III.Six patients were treated with uniplanar external fixator, while the remaining five underwent retrograde intramedullary interlocking nail. The outcomes were measured for union radiologically, development of complications and clinical follow-up, according to digital archiving systems and old case notes. Results: All five (100) patients treated by intramedullary nailing achieved radiological union on an average follow-up of 16 weeks. The external fixation group had significantly higher rate of complications with one amputation, four non unions (66.7) and a delayed union which went on to full osseous union. Retrograde intramedullary nailing for tibio talar arthrodesis in Charcots neuro arthropathy yielded significantly better outcomes as compared to uniplanar external fixator.

Incidence of secondary displacement after osteosynthesis of proximal humerus fractures: a retrospective study of 185 cases	ACTA ORTHOPAEDICA BELGICA			English	Article						proximal humeral fracture; complications; secondary displacement; osteosynthesis; risk factor.	TOTAL SHOULDER ARTHROPLASTY; INTERNAL-FIXATION; NONOPERATIVE TREATMENT; PLATE FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; LOCKING PLATE; LOCKED PLATE; HEMIARTHROPLASTY; COMPLICATIONS	Proximal humerus fractures are the third most common fracture in patients over 65 years of age. There is no clear consensus regarding their treatment. The objective of this retrospective observational study was to calculate the incidence of secondary displacement after osteosynthesis of these fractures and to identify possible risk factors. 185 cases were reviewed and all osteosynthesized fractures between January 2008 and December 2016 were included. Data collected included age, sex, body mass index, alcohol and tobacco use, bone mineral density of the proximal humerus, fracture type, initial displacement, management time, type of treatment, surgeon's experience and expertise, and postoperative reduction quality. A radiographic follow-up was done at least 3 months following the fracture (until consolidation). The definition of secondary displacement was: varus/valgus displacement >10(degrees), tuberosity translation >5 mm, articular effraction or material breakage. 53 secondary displacements were found, with an incidence of 28.6%. Seventy-two percent were diagnosed at the first follow-up visit, which occurred at an average of 29 days postoperatively. Among all factors studied, only two were statistically significant for secondary displacement: 1) low proximal humeral bone density (defined by a Tingart index <4) appears to be a risk factor, with a calculated relative risk of 2.71 (p = 0.04); and 2) the operator's specialization in the upper limb appears to be a protective factor, with a relative risk of 0.27 (p = 0.01). A similar high incidence of complications after osteosynthesis of the proximal humerus is found in the literature, confirming the difficulty in managing these fractures. More attention should be given to patients with low bone density.	[Djebara, A.; Boulnois, I.; Fatayri, B.

Methods: Intra-articular distal femur fractures with metaphyseal comminution (OTA/AO 33-C) were simulated with a standardized model in 28 synthetic femora and divided into 4 groups. Group I was instrumented with a 4.5-mm lateral locked distal femoral plate alone, group II with a lateral locked plate plus a low-profile precontoured 3.5-mm medial distal tibial plate, group III with a lateral locked plate plus a medial 3.5-mm reconstruction plate, and group IV with a lateral locked plate plus a retrograde IMN. Specimens were then axially loaded and cycled to failure or runout. Outcomes of interest were baseline stiffness, survivability, and cycles to failure. Results: Groups III and IV have a significantly higher baseline stiffness (P < 0.001) when compared with groups I and II. Furthermore, groups III and IV had a higher max load to failure (P < 0.01) when compared with groups I and II. The survivability in groups III and IV was 71% and 100%, respectively, while no specimens in group I or II survived maximum loading. There was no significant difference between group III and IV regarding stiffness, survivability, and cycles to failure. Conclusion: When considering fixation for intra-articular distal femur fractures with metaphyseal comminution (OTA/AO 33-C), we found that supplementation of a lateral locked plate with a medial plate or an IMN to be biomechanically superior to lateral locked plating alone regarding stiffness, survivability, and cycles to failure. A low-profile precontoured plate did not add significantly to the construct stiffness in this study.

Materials and Methods: The authors designed a retrospective cohort study and enrolled a sample derived from patients presenting to the Harborview Medical Center from 2009 through 2014 for the management of open mandibular fractures. Eligible patients were at least 18 years of age with open, isolated mandibular fractures treated by open reduction and internal fixation using transoral approaches or closed reduction and intermaxillary fixation. The primary predictor variable was antibiotic exposure. The study group received antibiotics administered within 1 hour before the incision, with possible intraoperative re-dosing, and the control group received antibiotics according to the study group plus preoperative or postoperative antibiotics. The primary outcome was SSI frequency. The secondary outcome was AAE frequency. Univariate, bivariate, and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. Statistical significance was set at a P value less than or equal to .05. Results: The sample was comprised of 510 patients (mean age, 29 +/- 11.4 yr; 86% men). The study group had 58 patients (11%) and the control group had 452 patients (89%). The SSI frequencies in the study and control groups were 9 and 17%, respectively (P = .13). There were 5 (1%) AAEs reported, all in the control group. In the multivariable logistic regression model, only tobacco use was associated with an increased risk for SSI (odds ratio = 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-5.5; P = .0015). Conclusion: Limiting antibiotic exposure to only intraoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing transoral operative treatment of isolated open mandibular fractures was not associated with an increased risk of SSIs.

Material/Methods: 37 patients with lumbar degenerative disease were treated with the Dynesys system plus transfacet decompression through the Wiltse approach. Results: Results showed that all patients healed from surgery without severe complications. The average follow-up time was 20 months (9-36 months). Visual Analogue Scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores decreased significantly after surgery and at the final follow-up. There was a significant difference in the height of the intervertebral space and intervertebral range of motion (ROM) at the stabilized segment, but no significant changes were seen at the adjacent segments. X-ray scans showed no instability, internal fixation loosening, breakage, or distortion in the follow-up. Conclusions: The Dynesys system plus transfacet decompression through the Wiltse approach is a therapeutic option for mild lumbar degenerative disease. This method can retain the structure of the lumbar posterior complex and the motion of the fixed segment, reduce the incidence of low back pain, and decompress the nerve root.

A comparison between ilioinguinal and modified Stoppa approach in anterior column acetabular fractures	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Modified Stoppa approach; Anterior pelvic approach; Ilioinguinal approach; Acetabular fracture; Pelvic fracture	PELVIC RING; FIXATION	Introduction: Pelvis fractures are among the most difficult fractures to manage and treat for Orthopedic surgeons. Anatomic reduction is the main goal to reach in the acetabular fractures' treatment. The following study compares clinical outcomes and complications of Ilioinguinal versus modified Stoppa approach in Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF) of anterior column acetabulum fractures. Materials and methods: A comparative analysis on 90 patients undergoing ORIF on acetabular fracture has been performed. Patients have been divided into two groups. The first group was treated by Ilioinguinal approach (n = 48), the second group by modified Stoppa approach (n = 42). The following parameters have been compareted: quality of fragment reduction; operative time; peri- and post-operative blood loss; complications; clinical and radiographic outcomes. Results: The modified Stoppa approach has shown a shorter mean operative time (146 min vs 175 min), fewer complications (14/48 vs 6/42), less blood loss both in the perio-operative phase (0.8 Hb pt vs 1.3 Hb pt) than in postoperative one (1.1 Hb pt vs 1.5 Hb pt), a lower rate of nerve, infections and critical complications. On the other hand, the ilioinguinal approach has showed better results in terms of quality of fracture reduction (43/48 patiens with anatomical or near anatomical reduction vs. 37/42). No significant differences concerning vascular lesions, clinical and functional outcomes have been found between the two groups. Conclusions: The modified Stoppa approach results in shorter operative time, less intra-operative blood loss and fewer complications than the ilioinguinal one. Greater anatomic reduction is achieved by Ilioinguinal approach; however, this does not necessarily translate into better clinical and functional outcomes which, overall, are comparable in the two analysed approaches. In conclusion, the modified Stoppa approach is deemed to be a better alternative in treating these fractures.

This study mainly discussed the application value of 3-dimensional (3D)-printed navigation template in C2 screw placement. Material/Methods: A retrospective study compared 3D-printed navigation template-assisted screw placement (group A, n=32) and the C-arm based navigation-assisted screw placement group (group B, n=32). Group A was divided into 2 subgroups: A1 (C2 pedicle screw placement) and A2 (C2 pars screw placement); group B was divided into B1 (C2 pedicle screw placement) and B2 (C2 pars screw placement). The accuracy and safety of screw placement and clinical outcomes were evaluated. Results: There were 64 C2 screws placed in group A, and 95.31% achieved a grade A accuracy rating, including 52 screws in group A1 (96.15% grade A) and 12 screws in group A2 (91.67% grade A). A total of 64 C2 screws were placed in group B, and 84.38% achieved a grade A accuracy rating, including 50 screws in group B1 (84.00% grade A) and 14 screws in group B2 (85.71% grade A). The accuracy of screw placement differed significantly between groups A and B (P=0.041) and between groups A1 and B1 (P=0.039) but not between groups A2 and B2 (P=0.636). The postoperative efficacy of the 2 groups was satisfactory. And there were no complications of blood vessels or nerves related to screw placement in either group. Conclusions: Although 3D-printed navigation template-assisted and C-arm based navigation-assisted C2 pedicle and pars screw placement provided similar safety and clinical efficacy, 3D-printed navigation template technology achieved more accurate C2 pedicle screw placement.

Under the same surgical procedures, the outcomes of CIA fractures are less desirable, compared to the outcomes of the traumatic calcaneal avulsion fractures. Here, the study suggests Achilles tenodesis technique using suture anchor after resection of the CIA fracture fragments could, provide satisfactory clinical results in the cases of surgically indicated CIA fractures. Materials and methods: This retrospective study included seven patients of calcaneal avulsion fracture who had. underlying diabetes mellitus (DM) and no specific traumatic event. The patients were treated with Achilles tenodesis techniques for their CIA fractures. Achilles tenodesis was performed using suture anchor with removal of the fracture fragments. The patients were evaluated with the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS), visual analogue scale (VAS), single-heel rise test, and X-ray images on their final follow-ups. Results: Initially, three of the CIA fracture cases treated with traditional open reduction and internal fixation reported pullout failure. Consequently, all patients received Achilles tenodesis using suture anchor after bone fragment resection and had good clinical outcomes. Only one subject with low compliance reported poor outcome. The FAOS of each patient were obtained at a mean of 16.3 months after surgery. The results are as follows: pain 80.6 (SD = 6.2), symptom 83.8 (SD = 4.9), activities of daily living 80.5 (SD = 8.0), sport and recreation function 75.6 (SD = 11.93), and foot- and ankle-related quality of life 77.9 (SD = 6.7). On their final follow-ups, the average VAS was 2.6 (range, 1 to 4). Conclusion: Achilles tenodesis using suture anchor after bone fragment resection achieved competent clinical results in the patients with CIA fractures. The study proposes that this surgical procedure could be an appropriate treatment option for patients with CIA fractures.

This single center study analyzes changes and optimizations of treatment over an observation period of 16 years and reports the results. Materials and Methods Retrospective analysis of all patients treated with a medial humeral epicondyle fracture between 2005 and 2020 at our institution. Results Ninety-six patients (mean 9.3 years, range 1 -15) were included in the study. In 25 cases (26 %), the fracture was associated with an elbow dislocation. Most patients received surgical treatment (83.3 %), whereas 17.7 % were treated nonoperatively. Surgical treatment consisted of open reduction and fixation with compression screw (n = 44 steel, n = 2 absorbable), K-wire (n = 30), a combination of screw/K-wire (n = 2), or a PDS suture (n = 1). Compression screws have been used significantly more often in the latter half of the study period (p = 0.006). Patients were immobilized in a long arm cast for 29 days (range 11 - 50). Eleven surgically treated patients were early mobilized in an elbow orthosis. After a mean follow up of 7.6 months [ 2 - 61), Mayo elbow performance index (MEPI) outcome was excellent in all 96 patients. Loss of elbow movement (LOM) was found to be mild in 30 and moderate in 15 patients. LOM was found to be associated with surgical treatment ( p = 0.001), and with concomitant elbow dislocations ( p = 0.29). One pseudarthrosis occurred after conservative treatment. A persistence of ulnar nerve palsy or recurrent joint instability has not been described. Conclusion Most children with medial humeral epicondyle fractures nowadays undergo surgery. Screw osteosynthesis represents the increasingly preferred method in order to prevent joint instability or nonunion, and to allow shorter immobilization duration. Overall results after medial epicondyle fractures are good. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Materials and methods Sixty-seven patients with displaced 3 and 4 part proximal humerus fractures were randomized into the control (n = 33) and TXA (n = 34) groups. Fifteen minutes before the skin incision, 15 mg/kg body weight of 0.9% sodium chloride solution or TXA was injected intravenously. Open reduction and internal fixation was conducted through a deltoid-pectoral approach with fixed angle locked plating (PHILOS) for all the patients. The patients were followed up 2 months after surgery. Total blood loss, blood test results, blood transfusion rate, and wound complications were analyzed between the two groups. Results Significant differences were observed in intraoperative blood loss and postoperative blood loss during the first 24 h between the two groups. There were no significant differences in postoperative blood loss during the second 24 h, wound complication rates, blood transfusion rate and adverse side effects. And thromboembolic events related with the application of TXA were not noted in the TXA group. Conclusion Preoperative administration of tranexamic acid could reduce intraoperative and postoperative blood loss in patients with complex proximal humeral fractures.

Early correction of paediatric malunited distal metaphyseal radius fractures using percutaneous callus osteoclasis ("Calloclasis")	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Callus osteoclasis; Radius fractures; Malunion; Child wrist fracture	FOREARM FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; CHILDREN; REDUCTION; OSTEOTOMY; PLATE	Introduction: Closed reduction of secondary displacements of distal metaphyseal radius fractures is an easy procedure only when performed within the first ten to fifteen days post-trauma, prior to the occurrence of malunion. When a hard bony callus prevents proper reduction, an open osteotomy is generally advocated. Hypothesis: We suggest the use of a less invasive technique which aims at correcting early malunion when closed reduction is made impossible: the percutaneous callus osteoclasis. Materials and methods: Callus osteoclasis consists in a series of multiple bone-drilling in a postage stamp pattern performed under image intensifier using a large diameter pin, at a distance from the growth plate. Once the bone has been weakened, reduction is obtained by using the pin as an intrafocal lever. The pin is then pushed through the opposite cortex to ensure postero-lateral stabilization. Results: Twenty-one patients were managed using this technique and reported good results with no complications. Discussion: This technique offers a low aggressive management of malunions and may be performed within two to six weeks after trauma. Level of evidence: Level IV. Multicenter retrospective study.

Materials and Methods: A total of 52 patients with type 7 humeral head fracture (in accordance with Hertel classification) were enrolled retrospectively: 24 patients [4 male, 20 female; mean age (standard deviation [SD]): 68.9 (5.8) years] were treated with Diphos H plate (Group A) and 28 patients [6 male, 22 female; mean age (SD): 61.0 (7.5) years] with Proximal Humeral Plate (PHP; Group B). The mean follow-up periods were 25.6 and 18.9 months, respectively. Functional outcomes were assessed using the Constant score and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score; X-ray evaluation was also performed and complications were recorded. Results: The mean Constant score in the Diphos and PHP groups at follow-up were 75.6 (SD 13.4) and 78.9 (SD 12.8), respectively (p > 0.05). The DASH score was similar in both groups (Diphos: 18.6, range 0-51.5; PHP: 16.8, range 0-47.8) (p > 0.05). In our series, 9.6% of patients had complications; these included a case of aseptic non-union and a case of avascular necrosis of the humeral head in each group, and a secondary screw perforation in a patient treated with Diphos. Conclusions: In patients with Hertel 7 proximal humeral fractures, Diphos and PHP lead to similar satisfactory functional outcomes and are associated with low complication rates; this confirms that both are useful implants for the treatment of this pattern of fracture.

Complex inter-relationships between these factors were also evaluated. Materials and methods: Data were collected from a prospective cohort study that included 3 operative groups repaired using nail or plate fixation and 1 nonoperative group. From the available information, various factors potentially having a direct influence on the functional Constant score were identified. The process of creating a hypothetical causal path diagram was undertaken to order the factors in a sequence of associations or cause-and-effect relationships. Results: Our final multivariable regression model for the 1-year Constant score included the 6 factors of age, sex, treatment, occurrence of intraoperative and local post-treatment complications, and anatomic restoration. Being a woman aged older than 40 years, treated with a locking proximal humeral plate (LPHP), having experienced intraoperative and local post-treatment complications, and varus deformity of more than 30 degrees were negative predictors of the Constant score (ie, poor shoulder function 1 year after treatment initiation). Three factors, the dominant side fractured and the Neer and AO fracture type, showed only significant association on intermediate factors. The presence of concomitant disease did not show any significant direct or indirect effect. A final pathway outlines these associations and inter-relationships. Conclusion: Prevention of local complications, in particular those leading to severe varus deviation, appears essential to improve shoulder function after a proximal humeral fracture.

In orthopedic surgery training, certain hip fractures are one of the most common operations performed by residents. It has been questioned, whether residents can provide as safe treatment and patient outcomes as those of more experienced surgeons. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of surgical experience on risk of complications by comparing the surgical performance and clinical outcomes in femoral neck osteosyntheses between surgical residents and orthopaedic surgeons.Methods All patients with femoral neck fracture admitted to Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District (HUS) Hyvinkaa Hospital from 2011 to 2016 were collected as research material. 88 hip fractures (87 patients) treated with DHS or MCS osteosyntheses were included in this study. The patients were divided into 2 groups, based on the surgeon's experience: an orthopedic surgeon group (n = 68) and a surgical resident group (n = 20). All data from complications, reoperations, and the duration of operations were collected.Results There was no significant difference in characteristics of operated patients between orthopaedics and residents group. There was no significant difference in complications or re-operations between groups (p = 0.4, p = 0.2). Surgical residents had statistically longer surgical time (mean 76 min, 95% CI 62.92 min, mean 46 min, 95% Cl 42.51 min; p-value < 0.001). Still surgical time was not a risk factor for complication (p-value 0.5).Conclusion Our results show that surgical residents ' outcomes in femoral neck fracture osteosynthesis seem to be as favorable as those of orthopedic surgeons; the operations just last slightly longer.

Materials and methods: This is a double-centre single-arm observational study. Retrospective review of electronic records identified all oncologic patients who had undergone femoral neck PIGSMO. Inclusion criteria were: non-displaced or mildly displaced PF/InF, and ImF (Mirels' score >= 8); life expectancy >= 1 month; unsuitability for surgical treatment due to sub-optimal clinical fitness, refusal of consent, or unacceptable delay to systemic therapy. Results: Eleven patients were treated (mean age 63.7 +/- 13.5 years) due to ImF (63.6%, mean Mirels' score 10.1), PF (27.3%) or post-radiation InF (9.1%) under CT/fluoroscopy-(36.4%) or CBCT-(63.6%) guidance. Thirty-two screws were implanted and cement injection was added in 36.4% cases. Technical success was 90.9%. No procedure related complications were noted. At 1-month clinical follow-up (pain/walking impairment), 63.6% and 27.3% patients reported significant and mild improvement, respectively. Imaging follow-up (available in 63.6% cases) showed no signs of secondary fractures, neither of screws loosening at mean 2.8 months. Five patients (45.5%) died after PIGSMO (mean time interval 3.6 months). Conclusions: PIGSMO is technically feasible and safe in cancer patients with limited life expectancy; it offers good short-term results. Further prospective studies are required to corroborate mid-and to prove long-term efficacy of the technique. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study compares the clinical and radiological outcome parameters between posterior atlantoaxial fusion (AAF) and occipitocervical fusion (OCF) constructs in the treatment of the unstable atlas fracture. Materials and Methods: 68 consecutive patients with unstable Jefferson fractures treated by AAF or OCF between October 2004 and March 2011 were included in this retrospective evaluation from institutional databases. The authors reviewed medical records and original images. The patients were divided into two surgical groups treated with either AAF (n = 48, F/M 30:18) and OCF ( n = 20, F/M 13:7) fusion. Blood loss, operative time, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, visual analog scale (VAS) score, atlanto-dens interval, lateral mass displacement, complications, and the bone fusion rates were recorded. Results: Five patients with incomplete paralysis (7.4%) demonstrated postoperative improvement by more than 1 grade on the American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale. The JOA score of the AAF group improved from 12.5 +/- 3.6 preoperatively to 15.7 +/- 2.3 postoperatively, while the JOA score of the OCF group improved from 11.2 +/- 3.3 preoperatively to 14.8 +/- 4.2 postoperatively. The VAS score of AAF group decreased from 4.8 +/- 1.5 preoperatively to 1.0 +/- 0.4 postoperatively, the VAS score of the OCF group decreased from 5.4 +/- 2.2 preoperatively to 1.3 +/- 0.9 postoperatively. Conclusions: The OCF or AAF combined with short-term external immobilization can establish the upper cervical stability and prevent further spinal cord injury and nerve function damage.

Percutaneous pinning for non-comminuted extra-articular fractures of distal radius	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Extraarticular distal radius fracture; immobilization with wrist in neutral position; percutaneous pinning	INTRAARTICULAR FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; EXTERNAL FIXATION; COLLES FRACTURES; END; ALGODYSTROPHY; MANAGEMENT; REDUCTION; OSTEOTOMY; ADULTS	Background: Various treatment modalities have been described for the treatment of extra-articular distal radius fractures each with its own merits and demerits. Most of the work done with percutaneous pinning has shown a significant residual stiffness of the hand and wrist. Our technique involves percutaneous pinning of the fracture and immobilization in neutral position of the wrist for three weeks. This study's aim was to examine the functional outcome of percutaneous K-wiring of these extra-articular distal radius fractures with immobilization in neutral position of the wrist. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective study of 32 patients aged between 18 and 70 years with extra-articular distal radius fracture. Patients were treated with closed reduction and percutaneous pinning using two or three K-wires. A below-elbow plaster of paris dorsoradial slab was applied in neutral position of the wrist for 3 weeks. At the end of 3 weeks, the slab was removed and wrist physiotherapy started. The radiographs were taken postoperatively, at 3 weeks, 6 weeks and 6 months. The functional evaluation of the patients was done at 6 months follow-up. We used Sarmiento's modification of Lindstrom criteria and Gartland and Werley's criteria for evaluation of results. Results: Excellent to good results were seen in 93.75% of the cases while 6.25% had fair results. The complications observed were pin loosening (n=13), pin tract infection (n=2), malunion (n=2), wrist joint stiffness (n=2), reduced grip strength (n=2) and injury to the superficial radial nerve (n=1). Conclusion: Percutaneous pinning followed by immobilization of the wrist in neutral position is a simple and effective method to maintain reduction and prevent stiffness of wrist and hand.

Complications prompting reoperation can occur, leading to additional quality of life and financial cost. One common event preceding reoperation is a broken implant (BI). The purpose of this study was to identify the rate of reoperation following surgical stabilization of MPHF with three techniques - photodynamic bone stabilization (PBS), intramedullary nail (IMN), and cemented plate fixation (CPF) - and estimate to what extent improved implant durability might prevent reoperation. Materials and methods: Retrospective data collection was performed, identifying 105 procedures (100 patients) who underwent non-articular MPHF surgery from 2010-2016: 19 PBS, 65 IMN, 21 CPF. All patients were followed for at least two years or until death. Results: Reoperation rates were similar at one year (10.5%,6.2%,4.8%, p = 737), two years (15.8%,6.2%,9.5%, p = 375), and final evaluation (15.8%,7.7%,14.3%, p = 248). The rate of 13I for PBS, IMN, and CPF was 10.5%,0%, and 4.8% (p = 049 PBS/IMN) at one year, 15.8%,0%, and 9.5% (p = 010 PBS/IMN) at two years, and 15.8%,0%, and 14.3% (p = 010 IMN/PBS, p = 013 IMN/CPF) at final evaluation. Conclusions: Reoperation rate was not significantly different at any time point. However, IMN surgery resulted in the lowest rate of broken implants (zero), statistically significant versus PBS at all time periods and versus CPF at final follow-up. PBS may eventually offer selected advantages for MPHF management, but current data suggests fragility must be thoughtfully considered. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) is favored by many authors, several percutaneous techniques have been introduced to reduce complications and to obtain satisfactory clinical and radiological results. Among these percutaneous treatments, balloon reduction and bone graft augmentation is gaining an increasing popularity. Materials and methods: We retrospectively examined a series of 42 patients treated operatively with a minimally invasive reduction technique using an inflatable bone tamp filled with tricalcium phosphate (calcaneoplasty) for Sander's type II, III and IV calcaneal fractures between 2010 and 2015. Conventional X-rays and CT scan were performed pre-operatively, at 3 and 12 months post-operatively and at the last-follow-up. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score and the Maryland Foot Score (MFS) were used for clinical evaluation. Bohler's angle and the Score Analysis of Verona (SAVE) were calculated to assess bone reduction. Results: All 42 patients were available for clinical and radiographic follow-up at an average of 665 months (range 38-92). At the last follow-up the mean AOFAS score was 82.1 (good) and the mean MFS was 80.8 (good). The mean Bohler's angle improved from 1.29 degrees pre-operatively to 27.8 degrees at the last follow-up. The SAVE highlighted good and excellent results in 30 (72%) patients. There were only 3 (7.1%) cases of superficial skin infection with only 6 (14.2%) patients complaining of residual pain. No cases of adverse reaction or deep infection were observed. Conclusions: Calcaneoplasty appears to be a valid option of treatment for calcaneal fractures and a reliable alternative to ORIF. This technique allows stable fracture reduction and early weight-bearing combined with good clinical and radiological results and few complications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Study Design: Retrospective case series. Animals: Dogs (n = 13). Materials and Methods: Medical records (September 1995-December 2005) of dogs with fracture/luxation of the cervical spine, or AA subluxations, were reviewed. Only dogs that had intraoperative linear distraction using the base of the skull as a purchase point for a self-retaining retractor were included. Signalment, presenting neurologic deficits, fracture location, and concurrent injury were recorded. Both short-term in-hospital follow-up, including healing and any complications, and long-term telephone follow-up were obtained. Results: Realignment of the spinal vertebrae, reestablishing the normal properties of the spinal canal, was achieved after distraction in all dogs. Screws and small pins incorporated into polymethylmethacrylate cement were used to span the fracture ventrally and achieve rigid internal fixation. Eight dogs had a complete neurologic recovery, 2 dogs had slight residual ataxia, 2 dogs died, and 1 dog was lost to follow-up. Healing was good (mean, 7.5 weeks) or excellent (mean, 5.1 months) based on in-hospital follow-up (mean, 5.1 months). On final telephone follow-up (mean, 7.7 years), no dogs were reported to have had any associated problems or additional surgery. Conclusions: This surgical distraction technique was a reliable, relatively simple method to obtain reduction of fracture/luxations of C1-2 to re-align the spinal canal. Mortality in this series appears lower than that previously reported and supports surgical management of these injuries.

Materials and Methods Antebrachial limb deformities in four small, and two large, breed dogs (seven limbs) were surgically corrected by a radial closing wedge ostectomy and ulnar osteotomy. The location and orientation of the wedge ostectomy were determined using CT data, computer-assisted planning and production of a saw guide in plastic using a 3D printer. At surgery, the guide was clamped to the surface of the radius and used to direct the oscillating saw blade. The resultant ostectomy was closed and stabilized with a bone plate. Results Five limbs healed without complications. One limb was re-operated due to a poorly resolved rotational component of the deformity. One limb required additional stabilisation with external fixation due to screw loosening. The owners of five dogs completed a Canine Orthopedic Index survey at a follow-up period of 37 to 81 months. The median preoperative score was 3.5 and the median postoperative score was 1, representing an overall positive effect of surgery. Radiographically, 5/7 limbs were corrected in the frontal plane (2/7 were under-corrected). Similarly, 5/7 limbs were corrected in the sagittal plane, and 2/7 were over-corrected in the sagittal place. Conclusions Computer-aided design and rapid prototyping technologies can be used to create saw guides to simplify one-stage corrective osteotomies of the antebrachium using internal fixation in dogs. Despite the encouraging results, accurate correction of rotational deformity was problematic and this aspect requires further development.

Surgical Options for the Treatment of Simple Bone Cyst in Children and Adolescents	ISRAEL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL			English	Article						simple bone cyst; surgical treatment; curettage; corticosteroids; elastic stable intramedullary nail	LONG BONES; FOLLOW-UP; INJECTION; MARROW	Background: There are several treatment options for simple bone cysts, with treatment depending mainly on the experience and preference of the surgeon and the extension and location of the cyst. Objectives: To assess our experience with the surgical treatment of bone cyst lesions in pediatric patients at one institution by the same group of surgeons. Methods: The study group comprised 60 patients (43 boys, 17 girls) treated surgically for monostatic lesions between January 2002 and July 2007. The mean age at surgery was 11.8 years (range 4-17 years). Mean follow-up was 4.2 years. Most of the lesions were located at the proximal humerus. Patients were divided into five groups according to treatment method: a) corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 40-80 mg) (n=26); b) curettage and bone grafting (fibula or iliac crest) (n=16); c) aspiration of the bone cavity and subsequent bone marrow transplantation (n=10); cl) internal preventive fixation using an elastic stable intramedullary nail (n=5); and e) curettage and implantation of a synthetic cancellous bone substitute (pure beta-tricalcium phosphate substitute, ChronOS (R), Synthes, Switzerland) (n=3). Results: Treatment success was evaluated by the Capanna criteria. Successful results were observed in 68% (18 complete healing, 23 healing with residual radiolucent areas), 30% recurrence rate, and no response to treatment in one patient (2%). We recorded recurrence in 50% of the children treated by corticosteroid injection, and one child did not respond to treatment. Conclusions: The best results were achieved in children treated by curettage and the subsequent use of an osteoconductive material, and in children treated with elastic intramedullary nail fixation. Despite our limited experience with calcium-triphosphate bone substitute, the treatment was mostly successful. Because of the short follow-up, further observation and evaluation are necessary.

We investigated the potential application of novel bioabsorbable plates and screws made of un-sintered hydroxyapatite/poly-L-lactide composite for the treatment of metacarpal fractures. We used this material for the fixation of four-corner fusions for SLAC or SNAC wrists commencing from April 2009. The purpose of this study was to clarify the controversy in the literature regarding the use of these plates. Methods The surgical procedures and clinical outcomes of four-corner fusions using a bioabsorbable (poly-L-lactic acid and hydroxyapatite) plate were reported. Ten patients (mean age, 59.2 years) with SLAC or SNAC wrists underwent fusions between April 2009 and June 2016. The primary diseases were scapholunate ligament injury, Preiser disease, and scaphoid pseudarthrosis. The mean postoperative follow-up period was 45.9 months (range, 12-86). Results In all patients, bone union was achieved without dislocation or pain. The mean wrist flexion and extension arc improved from 78.5 degrees before surgery to 90.5 degrees after surgery. Mean grip strength improved from 51 to 69% after surgery, and the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH) score improved from 53.5 to 14.3. No complications such as infection, avascular swelling, or tendon adhesion were observed. This implant requires no removal of internal fixation devices, produces stable outcomes, and is an effective fusion technique. Conclusions We summarized the outcomes of four-corner arthrodesis using bioabsorbable plates. Satisfactory clinical results were shown, with no obvious complications. This novel plate also serves as a good alternative for patients who are allergic to metals. Furthermore, bioabsorbable plates are advantageous as they do not require removal.

Radius Fracture Repair Using Volumetrically Expanding Polyurethane Bone Cement	JOURNAL OF HAND SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME			English	Article						Biomechanics; bone cement; fixation; fracture repair; radius	COLLES; INTERFACE; STRENGTH; DEFECT; SHEAR; AGE	Purpose New repair techniques for fragility fractures such as those of the distal radius require biomechanical justification. This study was conducted to investigate a technique using an expanding polymer bone cement to provide strength to a fracture repair. Methods Distal and proximal ends were isolated from 6 pairs of human radii (mean age 65). Transverse osteotomies were made near the head of each specimen. Paired specimens were repaired using 2 materials of differing polymer chemistries: polyurethane versus polymethylmethacrylate. Repaired specimens were subjected to failure tests in a cantilever beam configuration (distal, n = 6 per treatment) or pure tension (proximal, n = 5 per treatment). Cement penetration tests were conducted using a uniform open-cell model of cancellous bone. Baseline mechanical properties of the polyurethane cement were determined according to ASTM standards. Results Distal radii repaired with polyurethane bone cement withstood average shear stress 2.9 times as high as polymethylmethacrylate (0.91 vs 0.31 MPa). Peak tensile bending stress was 2.5 times as high in polyurethane (2.57 vs 1.02 MPa). Under pure tension, polyurethane-repaired samples failed at 0.83 MPa versus 0.74 MPa for polymethylmethacrylate. The polyurethane cement expanded to penetrate 49% farther into the trabeculae. The polyurethane cement had mean compressive yield stress of 20.3 MPa, compressive modulus of 754 MPa, ultimate tensile stress of 18.5 MPa, and tensile elastic modulus of 723 MPa. Conclusions The biomechanical strength data indicate the potential of an expanding bone cement as a candidate strategy for fracture repair. Further evaluation might provide evidence for such an alternative repair strategy for fragility fractures, including those of the distal radius. Clinical relevance An approach that couples the benefits of closed reduction and internal fixation might prove an attractive paradigm for treatment of distal radius fractures.

We report the outcome of a new technique for arthroscopic fusion of symptomatic os acromiale with absorbable screws. Materials and methods: The study included 8 shoulders in 8 patients with symptomatic meso-type os acromiale who were treated with the use of a new technique for arthroscopic fusion with absorbable screws. The mean age was 54 years (range, 38-67 years), and the mean time from onset of symptoms to surgery was 18 months (range, 9-25 months). No patients reported a specific traumatic event before the onset of symptoms, and all noted the insidious onset of pain with no precipitating event. Results: The average length of follow-up was 22 months (range, 12-36 month). The average Constant score improved from 49 points (range, 35-57 points) to 81 points (range, 75-86 points). The average satisfaction score improved from 4.5 of 10 (range, 2-6) to 8.5 of 10 (range 7-9). All patients made a good clinical recovery at 3 to 6 months after surgery. At the last follow-up, full radiographic union was observed in 6 patients, partial union in 1 patient, and persistent radiologic nonunion in 1 patient. Anterior bulging of the absorbable screws was noted in 2 patients, and the screws were trimmed 6 months after the first procedure. Conclusions: We have found that this new arthroscopic technique of fixation of os acromiale with absorbable screws provides promising clinical, cosmetic, and radiologic results with high patient satisfaction.

Osteosynthesis of the fracture fragment or correction of elbow deformity with osteotomies and ulnar nerve transposition or sometimes both procedures combined is a controversial topic. We retrospectively evaluated open reduction and fixation cases in late presentation of lateral humeral condyle fracture in pediatric cases with regards to union and functional results. Materials and Methods: Twenty two pediatric (<= 12 years) patients with fractures of lateral condyle presenting 4 weeks or more post injury between the study period of 2006 and 2010 were included. Multiple K-wires/with or without screws along with bone grafting were used. At final evaluation, union (radiologically) and elbow function (Liverpool Elbow Score, LES) was assessed. Results: There were 19 boys and 3 girls. Followup averaged 33 months. Pain (n=9), swelling (n=6), restriction of elbow motion (n=6), prominence of lateral condylar region (n=4), valgus deformity (n=4) were the main presenting symptoms. Ulnar nerve function was normal in all patients. There were nine Milch type I and 13 type II fractures. Union occurred in 20 cases. One case had malunion and in another case there was resorption of condyle following postoperative infection and avascular necrosis. Prominent lateral condyles (4/12), fish tail appearance (n=7), premature epiphyseal closure (n=2) were other observations. LES averaged 8.12 (range, 6.66-9.54) at final followup. Conclusions: There is high rate of union and satisfactory elbow function in late presenting lateral condyle fractures in children following osteosynthesis attempt. Our study showed poor correlation between patient's age, duration of late presentation or Milch type I or II and final elbow function as determined by LES.

The objective of this study was to compare the infection risk and functional outcomes between open and closed tibial plateau fractures. Materials and methods: In this multicenter cohort study the propensity score matching was used to pair participants according to age, sex, and Schatzker classification. 190 patients were followed for 1 year postoperatively. The Fracture-Related Infection (FRI) Consensus Group criteria was used to diagnose infection. Knee functionality was measured using the Oxford Knee Score scale (OKS). Results: The proportion of open fractures was 5.1%, and the overall incidence rate of FRI was 8% with 14% of them represented by open fractures and 4% for closed fractures (p = 0.014). Open fractures were found to be a risk factor associated with FRI, with a 5.48 times higher probability of FRI than closed fractures (odds ratio 5.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.55-18.85). Among the study population, 50% had satisfactory functional outcomes of the knee (median OKS 45, IQR = 3). The median OKS was 44 (IQR = 11) in open fractures and 46 (IQR = 7) in closed ones (p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis showed that the OKS was 3 points lower for open fractures (95% CI -5.530--0.478) than closed ones, and the score was 9.7 points lower for FRI. Conclusion: Open TPF is a risk factor that increases the probability of fracture related infections. Functional outcomes were excellent for both open and closed TPF, with a slight difference numerical that was under the minimal clinical difference (MCID). The presence of FRI significantly decreases the functional outcome.

The following clinical characteristics were recorded and analyzed: age, gender, fracture classification, body mass index (BMI), history of diabetes mellitus, history of stroke, preoperative albumin, preoperative hemoglobin (Hb), preoperative arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), time between admission and surgery, lower limb thrombosis, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, operative time, operative blood loss, and intraoperative blood transfusion. The prevalence of these clinical characteristics in delirium group was evaluated, and the scoring system was established using logistic regression analysis. The performance of the scoring system was also prospectively validated.ResultsThe predictive scoring system was based on five clinical characteristics confirmed as significant predictors of postoperative delirium, namely, age > 75 years, history of stroke, preoperative Hb <= 100 g/L, preoperative PaO2 <= 60 mmHg, and time between admission to surgery > 3 days. Delirium group showed a significant higher score than non-delirium (6.26 vs. 2.29, P < 0.001), and the optimal cut-off value for the scoring system was 4 points. The sensitivity and specificity of the scoring system for predicting postoperative delirium were 82.61% and 81.62% in derivation set, respectively, and 72.71% and 75.00% in validation set.ConclusionThe predictive scoring system confirmed with achieve satisfactory sensitivity and specificity in predicting postoperative delirium in the elderly with intertrochanteric fracture. The risk of postoperative delirium in patients with the score of 5 to 11 is high, while the score of 0 to 4 is low.

The literature on adult radial neck fracture management is limited; also, there is a lack of a detailed fracture classification system. In our study, we are evaluating the modified Metaizeau technique for the treatment of adult radial neck fractures. We also describe a modification to the existing fracture classification proposed by Broberg and Morrey to make it more inclusive of different fracture patterns. Materials and methods: This is a prospective case series in which we included all the patients who presented to us with adult radial neck fractures. We used a modified Metaizeau technique to treat these fractures. Postoperatively, patients were followed up for a minimum duration of 1 year with a visual analog scale score, the Mayo Elbow Performance Score, the Oxford Elbow Score, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score, and a subjective satisfaction questionnaire. Results: We included a total of 7 patients who had completed follow-up of 1 year. Of the total 7 cases, 3 cases had an associated radial head fracture (undisplaced), and 1 had an associated radial shaft fracture (segmental pattern). Elastic nails were removed at 6 weeks, and all fractures united. The subjects returned to their preinjury activity levels by the end of 3 months and had excellent outcomes as measured by various outcome scores. Conclusion: The modified Metaizeau technique for closed reduction and internal fixation of adult radial neck fractures is effective and simple and has no complications compared with other treatment methods. However, further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to arrive at a more meaningful conclusion. (c) 2017 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees. All rights reserved.

Methods: Twenty-one patients (16 men and 5 women) with a mean age of 34.1 years (range, 28 to 44 years) with coronal plane supracondylar and condylar fractures of the distal femur were included in this study. Each patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation using the ASC and PTCS. Active functional exercises with restricted weight bearing were initiated the first postoperative day. A gradual increase in weight bearing status and range of motion was permitted and subjects progressed to full weight bearing by 8 weeks. Surgical time, blood loss, postoperative knee range of motion, American Knee Society Scores (KSS), and postoperative complications were assessed. Results: The mean surgical time was 75 mins (range, 45 to 100 mins) and average blood loss was 105 ml (range, 35 to 130 ml). Mean follow-up was 65 months (range, 22 to 90 months). No subjects demonstrated evidence of osteonecrosis or arthritis at the final follow-up. The mean KSS was excellent (>= 85) in 8 subjects, good (70-84) in 11 subjects, and fair (60-69) in 2 subjects. The mean active range of motion of knee flexion at final follow-up was 100 degrees (range, 85 to 110 degrees). Conclusions: ASC combined with PTCS can serve as an effective means for managing comminuted femoral fractures that extend from the condyle to the supracondylar region. However, further prospective comparative studies and biomechanical analyses are needed to evaluate long-term outcomes using these materials.

Hypothesis: The anterior approach is an effective surgical technique for these fractures and can be used to correct the AS-induced cervical-thoracic kyphosis. Materials and methods: This continuous, retrospective series between 1990 and 2010 included 19 patients aged 33 to 84 years who presented with a lower cervical spine fracture in the context of AS. The average follow-up was 45 months. Sixteen of these patients were surgically treated using an anterior approach and anterior fixation. In five patients without any neurological deficit, their cervical-thoracic kyphosis was corrected during the same surgery. Regional kyphosis was measured before the surgery, immediately after the surgery and at the last follow-up. Results: Five deaths occurred; these were all patients with post-traumatic complete quadriplegia. Most the incomplete neurological problems improved (66%). In no cases did the neurological condition worsen. Among the 16 patients operated with the anterior approach, two patients also required an additional procedure with a posterior approach because of a persistent neurological deficit. The fractures in the operated patients who survived (14 patients) had healed within an average 4-month delay (range 3-7 months), without worsening of the kyphosis at final follow-up. In the five cases where the kyphosis was corrected, the correction averaged 26. (range 18-36 degrees); there were no neurological complications. Discussion: Based on these results, we suggest using the anterior approach to perform internal fixation as a treatment for cervical fractures secondary to AS and to correct the cervical-thoracic kyphosis in patients without neurological deficits. Level of evidence: Level IV - retrospective study. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Hypothesis.-Locked and minimally-invasive plating is a promising treatment option. Materials and methods.-The aim of this prospective, multicentric study is to describe a recently introduced surgical technique for proximal humeral fractures and to evaluate the radiographic and clinical outcomes of this operation. Closed and minimally-invasive reduction is first performed. A proximal humerus specific locking plate featuring multiple-angle screws is secondly implanted. Proper identification and protection of the axillary nerve with the index finger during plate insertion on the lateral humeral side is highly advisable. If it can't be palpated, a classic delto-pectoral approach should be preferred. Thirty-four patients were included in this study with a 1-year minimal postoperative follow-up. Twenty-two patients presented a two-part surgical neck fracture according to the Neer classification and 12 patients had a three part valgus-impacted fracture. DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) and Constant scoring systems were used for functional evaluation. Results.-Specifically, no axillary nerve injury and no loss of reduction were observed. The median Constant score and the mean DASH score were 82 and 26 respectively at 1-year follow-up. The age-adjusted functional scores values were satisfactory. Two of the patients (6%) required surgical revision for intra-articular screw penetration. Discussion.-Our study suggests that percutaneous plating with angular screw fixation of proximal humeral fractures is a safe and effective method, which produces good functional and radiologic outcomes. These minimally-invasive techniques allowing a better preservation of soft-tissues help promote early functional recovery. This more friendly approach combined to upgraded implants and instruments will also improve early and long-term outcomes of these fractures.

Despite the availability of plating systems for treating distal radius fractures, little is known about the mechanical properties of multidirectional fixed-angle plates. The aim of this study was to compare the primary fixation stability of three possible screw configurations in a distal extra-articular fracture model using a multidirectional fixed-angle plate with metaphyseal cancellous screws distally. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighteen Sawbones radii (Sawbones, Sweden, model# 1027) were used to simulate an extra-articular distal radius fracture according to AO/OTA 23 A3. Plates were fixed to the shaft with one non-locking screw in the oval hole and two locking screws as recommended by the manufacturer. Three groups (n = 6) were defined by screw configuration in the distal metaphyseal fragment: Group 1: distal row of screws only; Group 2: 2 rows of screws, parallel insertion; Group 3: 2 rows of screws, proximal screws inserted with 30A degrees of inclination. Specimens underwent mechanical testing under axial compression within the elastic range and load controlled between 20 N and 200 N at a rate of 40 N/s. Axial stiffness and type of construct failure were recorded. RESULTS: There was no difference regarding axial stiffness between the three groups. In every specimen, failure of the Sawbone-implant-construct occurred as plastic bending of the volar titanium plate when the dorsal wedge was closed. DISCUSSION: Considering the limitations of the study, the recommendation to use two rows of screws or to place screws in the proximal metaphyseal row with inclination cannot be supported by our mechanical data.

Aims: The various indications for CR in CVJ pathologies are discussed. Settings and Design: Retrospective analysis. Materials and Methods: Fifty-four patients (mean age: 31.02 +/- 13.44 years; male: female ratio=5.75:1) who underwent CR stabilization are included. The majority had congenital atlantoaxial dislocation (AAD; n=50); two had CVJ tuberculosis; one each had rheumatoid arthritis and C2-3 listhesis, respectively. The indications for CR fusion in congenital AAD were associated Chiari 1 malformation (C1M) (n=29); occipitalized C1 arch and/or malformed or deficient C1 or C2 posterior elements (n=9); hypermobile AAD (n=2); and, rotatory AAD (n=3). Contoured rod as a revision procedure was also performed in seven patients. Most patients were in poor grade (18 in Grade III [partial dependence for daily needs] and 15 in Grade IV [total dependence]); 15 patients were in Grade II [independent except for minor deficits] and six in Grade I [no weakness except hyperreflexia or neck pain]. Results: Twenty-four patients improved, 18 stabilized and six deteriorated at a mean follow-up (FU) of 17.78 +/- 19.75 (2-84) months. Six patients were lost to FU. In 37 patients with a FU of at least three months, stability and bony union could be assessed. Thirty-one of them achieved a bony fusion/stable construct. Conclusions: Contoured rod is especially useful for PF in cases of congenital AAD with coexisting CIM, cervical scoliosis, sub-axial instability and/or asymmetrical facet joints. In acquired pathologies with three-column instability, inclusion of joints one level above the affected one by using CR, especially enhances stability.

Retention of flexible intramedullary nails following treatment of pediatric femur fractures	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						pediatric; femur fracture; titanium; bone nail; treatment outcome	FEMORAL-SHAFT FRACTURES; TITANIUM ELASTIC NAILS; INTERNAL-FIXATION; METAL REMOVAL; CHILDREN; COMPLICATIONS	Introduction Flexible intramedullary nails are commonly used for the treatment of diaphyseal femur fractures in children. Although, their removal after fracture healing is advocated by some, there are no definitive studies to support the routine removal of these implants. The purpose of this study is to determine the natural history of children with diaphyseal fractures of the femur treated with flexible intramedullary nails and no scheduled nail removal. Material and Methods We performed a retrospective case series of 24 consecutive children treated at our tertiary pediatric referral center for closed diaphyseal femur fractures. All children had intramedullary fixation with flexible titanium nails. The main outcomes measured are fracture healing, incidence of hardware removal, and pain assessment with the use of a follow-up telephone questionnaire. Results All the patients healed their fractures. The average follow-up time was 3.6 years. A total of six patients had removal of nails for any reason at an average of 15 months post-injury. The survivorship free of revision due to persistent pain was 72% at 5 years of follow-up. Twenty-two patients were reached by phone for a final follow-up questionnaire. There was no difference in reports of residual symptoms of pain among those who did have nails removed and those who did not (P = 0.626). Conclusions Among children with femur fractures treated with flexible intramedullary nailing without scheduled implant removal, about a quarter may ultimately require a second procedure for nail removal due to persistent discomfort. Moreover, up to half of patients can have residual non-debilitating pain at 2-5 years post-injury regardless of presence or absence of the implant. Whether this is a previously unrecognized adverse outcome of this injury or treatment approach, or due to routinely leaving nails in will have to be assessed in future controlled trials.

Material and Methods: We retrospectively, analyzed the characteristics and treatment of maxillofacial injuries in the patients over the age of 60 to analyze the trends and clinical characteristics of maxillofacial trauma in elder patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University (from 2010 to 2013) in central China and to present recommendations on prevention and management. Results: Of the 932 patients with maxillofacial injuries, 126 aged over 60 years old accounting for 13.52% of all the patients (male:female. 1.74:1: mean age, 67.08 years old). Approximately 52% of the patients were injured by falls. The most frequently observed type of injuries was soft tissue injuries (100%), followed by facial fractures (83.05%). Of the patients with soft tissue injuries, the abrasions accounted the most followed by lacerations. The numbers of patients of midface fracture (60 patients) were almost similar to the number of lower face fractures (66 patients). Eighty two patients (65.08%%) demonstrated associated injuries, of which craniocerebral injuries were the most prevalent. One hundred and four patients (82.54%) had other systemic medical conditions, with cardiovascular diseases the most and followed by metabolic diseases and musculoskeletal conditions. Furthermore, the study indicated a relationship between maxillofacial fractures and musculoskeletal conditions. Only 13 patients (10.32%) sustained local infections. of whom had other medical conditions. Most of the facial injuries (85.71%) in older people were operated including debridement, fixing loose teeth, reduction, intermaxillary fixation and open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). Conclusions: Our analysis of the characteristics of maxillofacial injuries in the elder patents may help to promote clinical research to develop more effective treatment and possibly prevent such injuries.

A high percentage of revision surgery following the use of bone cement has become a significant universal problem. This study determined whether incorporation of the amino acid derivative N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) in bone cement reduces its cytotoxicity and adds osteoconductivity to the material. Biocompatibility and bioactivity of PMMA-based bone cement with or without 25 mm NAC incorporation was examined using rat bone marrow-derived osteoblastic cells. Osteoconductive potential of NAC-incorporated bone cement was determined by mu CT bone morphometry and implant biomechanical test in the rat model. Generation of free radicals within the polymerizing bone cement was examined using electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Severely compromised viability and completely suppressed phenotypes of osteoblasts on untreated bone cement were restored to the normal level by NAC incorporation. Bone volume formed around 25 mm NAC-incorporated bone cement was threefold greater than that around control bone cement. The strength of bone-bone cement integration was 2.2 times greater for NAC-incorporated bone cement. For NAC-incorporated bone cement, the spike of free radical generation ended within 12 h, whereas for control bone cement, a peak level lasted for 6 days and a level greater than half the level of the peak was sustained for 20 days. NAC also increased the level of antioxidant glutathione in osteoblasts. These results suggest that incorporation of NAC in PMMA bone cement detoxifies the material by immediate and effective in situ scavenging of free radicals and increasing intracellular antioxidant reserves, and consequently adds osteoconductivity to the material.

J	Chandra, G; Pandey, A				Chandra, Girish; Pandey, Ajay			Effectiveness of laddered embossed structure in a locking compression plate for biodegradable orthopaedic implants	JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Locking compression plate; embossed; biodegradable implant; magnesium; design	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; IN-VITRO; CORROSION BEHAVIOR; FINITE-ELEMENT; ALLOYS; MG; MICROSTRUCTURE; BIOCOMPATIBILITY; BIOMATERIALS; DEGRADATION	Locking compression plate (LCP) has conventionally been the most extensively employed plate in internal fixation bone implants used in orthopaedic applications. LCP is usually made up of non-biodegradable materials that have a higher mechanical capability. Biodegradable materials, by and large, have less mechanical strength at the point of implantation and lose strength even more after a few months of continuous degradation in the physiological environment. To attain the adequate mechanical capability of a biodegradable bone implant plate, LCP has been modified by adding laddered - type semicircular filleted embossed structure. This improved design may be named as laddered embossed locking compression plate (LELCP). It is likely to provide additional mechanical strength with the most eligible biodegradable material, namely, Mg-alloy, even after continuous degradation that results in diminished thickness. For mechanical validation and comparison of LELCP made up of Mg-alloy, four-point bending test (4PBT) and axial compressive test (ACT) have been performed on LELCP, LCP and continuously degraded LELCP (CD-LELCP) with the aid of finite element method (FEM) for the assembly of bone segments, plate and screw segments. LELCP, when subjected to the above mentioned two tests, has been observed to provide 26% and 10.4% lower equivalent stress, respectively, than LCP without degradation. It is also observed mechanically safe and capable of up to 2 and 6 months of continuous degradation (uniform reduction in thickness) for 4PBT and ACT, respectively. These results have also been found reasonably accurate through real-time surgical simulations by approaching the most optimal mesh. According to these improved mechanical performance parameters, LELCP may be used or considered as a viable biodegradable implant plate option in the future after real life or in vivo validation.

Despite "newly described intramedullary nails" with specific anatomical shapes there still remain major complications regarding this procedure. The following study presents a modified biomechanical test setup for investigations of the hindfoot. Methods: Nine fresh-frozen specimens from below the human knee were anaysed using the Hindfoot Arthrodesis Nail (Synthes) instrument. Quasi-static biomechanical testing was performed for internal/external rotation, varus/valgus and dorsal/plantar flexion using a modified established setup (physiological load entrance point, sledge at lever arm to apply pure moments). Additionally, a 3D optical measurement system was added to allow determination of interbony movements. Results: The mean torsional range of motion (ROM) calculated from the actuator data of a material testing machine was 10.12 degrees (SD 0.6) compared to 10 degrees (SD 2.83) as measured with the Optotrak (R) system (between tibia and calcaneus). The Optotrak showed 40 % more rotation in the talocrural joint. Mean varus/valgus ROM from the material testing flexion machine was seen to be 5.65 degrees (SD 1.84) in comparison to 2.82 degrees (SD 0.46) measured with the Optotrak. The subtalar joint showed a 70 % higher movement when compared to the talocrural joint. Mean ROM in the flexion test was 5.3 degrees (SD 1.45) for the material testing machine and 2.1 degrees (SD 0.39) for the Optotrak. The movement in the talocrural joint was 3 times higher compared to the subtalar joint. Conclusion: The modified test setup presented here for the hindfoot allows a physiological biomechanical loading. Moreover, a detailed characterisation of the bone-implant constructs is possible.

JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article						Bioresorbable plate; flat-type osteosynthesis device; zygomatic fracture	POLY-L-LACTIDE; UNSINTERED HYDROXYAPATITE; MANDIBULAR FRACTURES; PLATE REMOVAL; COMPOSITES; PARTICLES; PLLA/PGA; SURGERY	Introduction:In recent years, bioresorbable plates have undergone remarkable development. However, there has been no attendant improvement in their strength, because strength requires thickness, and complications such as palpability are related to the thickness of bioresorbable plate systems. In this clinical study, we compared the surgical management of zygomatic fractures using newly developed thinner bioresorbable materials or conventional titanium miniplates.Methods:Twelve patients with zygomatic fractures were randomly divided equally into 2 groups (6 with new bioresorbable osteosynthesis materials and 6 with standard titanium miniplates). Using computed tomography, we evaluated the thickness of the soft tissue and plate at the zygomaticofrontal sutures in each patient with the help of detailed radiographic computed tomography data at 6 months postoperatively. We compared the amount of soft-tissue volume increase between the uninjured healthy and injured operated sides in each patient.Results:Both groups eventually achieved satisfactory healing, with a favorable restoration of form and function and without any complications, including palpability. The amount of soft-tissue volume increase at the operated side relative to the uninjured healthy side using new thin bioresorbable plates was 131.1% (range: 101.5-165.8). On the other hand, that of titanium miniplates was 126.4% (range: 102.2-167.6). There was no statistically significant difference (P>0.05).Conclusion:This newly developed thinner flat-type bioresorbable plate system could be considered clinically useful in the treatment of zygomatic fractures even in easily palpated areas, such as the infraorbital rim or zygomaticofrontal sutures, without any healing differences in skeleton as compared with conventional titanium miniplates.

Engineering Silicone Rubbers for In Vitro Studies: Creating AAA Models and ILT Analogues With Physiological Properties	JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article						abdominal aortic aneurysm; mock artery models; realistic properties	ABDOMINAL AORTIC-ANEURYSM; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; STENT-GRAFT; BIOMECHANICAL BEHAVIOR; WALL; PRESSURE; REPAIR; THROMBUS; ENDOTENSION; FABRICATION	In vitro studies of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) have been widely reported. Frequently mock artery models with intraluminal thrombus (ILT) analogs ate used to mimic the in vivo AAA. While the models used may be physiological, their properties are frequently either not reported or investigated. This study is concerned with the testing and characterization of previously used vessel analog materials and the development of new materials for the manufacture of AAA models. These materials were used in conjunction with a previously validated injection molding technique to manufacture AAA models of ideal geometry. To determine the model properties (stiffness (8) and compliance), the diameter change of each AAA model was investigated under incrementally increasing internal pressures and compared with published in vivo studies to determine if the models behaved physiologically. A FEA study was implemented to determine if the pressure-diameter change behavior of the models could be predicted numerically. ILT analogs were also manufactured and characterized. Ideal models were manufactured with ILT analog internal to the aneurysm region, and the effect of the ILT analog on the model compliance and stiffness was investigated. The wall materials had similar properties (E-init 2.22 MPa and 1.57 MPa) to aortic tissue at physiological pressures (1.8 MPa (front literature)). ILT analogs had a similar Young's modulus (0.24 MPa and 0.33 MPa) to the medial layer of ILT (0.28 MPa (front literature)). All models had aneurysm sac compliance (2.62-8.01 x 10(-4)/mm Hg) in the physiological range (1.8-9.4 x 10(-4)/mm Hg (from literature)). The necks of the AAA models had similar stiffness (20.44-29.83) to healthy aortas (17.5 +/- 5.5 (from literature)). Good agreement was seen between the diameter changes due to pressurization in the experimental and FEA wall models with a maximum difference of 7.3% at 120 mm Hg. It was also determined that the inclusion of ILT analog in the sac of the models could have an effect on the compliance of the model neck. Ideal AAA models with physiological properties were manufactured. The behavior of these models due to pressurization was predicted using finite element analysis, validating this technique for the future design of realistic physiological AAA models. Addition of ILT analogs in the aneurysm sac was shown to affect neck behavior. This could have implications for endovascular AAA repair due to the importance of the neck for stent-graft fixation.

The u-HA/PLLA material has osteoconductive and osteosynthetic properties. However, quantitative, long-term outcome data after the use of u-HA/PLLA for orbital wall fractures are lacking. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 115 patients who underwent surgical repair of orbital wall fractures with a u-HA/PLLA sheet from 2011 to 2016. A chart review was performed, and the time-dependent changes at fracture sites were assessed by imaging. The immediate postoperative and the latest follow-up bony orbital volumes of the affected side were compared. Results: Seventy patients were eligible for this study (mean age, 44.6 +/- 22.1 years; 48 men and 22 women; mean follow-up period, 29.7 +/- 12.8 months). Except for one case of hematoma, there were no postoperative wound complications. Of the 70 patients, 10 had postoperative diplopia and 2 had enophthalmos; these conditions were presumably caused by the extension and severity of the fracture. Satisfactory reduction in the entire orbital wall, without pathological changes, was demonstrated. There were no significant differences in the mean bony orbital volumes of the affected side immediately after surgery (24.774 +/- 3.092 cm(3)) and at the latest follow-up (24.749 +/- 3.205 cm(3)) (p = 0.756). Conclusion: The u-HA/PLLA sheet is useful for orbital wall fracture reconstruction because of its desirable handling characteristics, initial mechanical strength, long-term maintenance of structural stability, radiopacity, and few associated complications. Future randomized controlled trials need to be performed to compare u-HA/PLLA with other conventional materials.

Close d re duction in the treatment of tibial tub ercle fractures	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Tibial tubercle fracture; Avulsion injury; Closed reduction; Open reduction; Adolescents; Obesity	AVULSION FRACTURE; TUBERCLE FRACTURES; TUBEROSITY; COMPLICATIONS; ADOLESCENTS; REDUCTION	Introduction: Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) is considered the standard care for displaced tibial tubercle fractures, but closed reduction and internal fixation (CRIF) can also be successful. Our aim was to compare outcomes between ORIF and CRIF for tibial tubercle fractures. Materials and methods: Children younger than 18 years presenting for a tibial tubercle fracture at a single institution. The main outcomes were operative details (blood loss, tourniquet time, operative time) and complications. Follow-up of at least one month was required. Results: 98 fractures from 95 patients were included. Follow-up averaged 8.7 months. 49% of the fractures had intraarticular involvement (type III). The most common associated injuries were patellar tendon tears and compartment syndrome, occurring in 10.2% and 3.1% of patients, respectively. No meniscal or ligamentous injuries were encountered. ORIF was performed for 81 fractures and CRIF for 17. Both groups were similar regarding sex, age, weight, and follow-up duration ( P > 0.4). No tourniquet was used for CRIF, while the majority of ORIF cases utilized a tourniquet for an average of 50.6 minutes. Operative blood loss was 31mL less in CRIF ( P < 0.0 0 01), and the procedure of CRIF was 23.3 minutes shorter than ORIF ( P = 0.0 0 03). All cases, except 1 fracture treated with ORIF, achieved union. The complication rate was similar in both groups ( P = 0.79). At final follow-up, patients from both groups had favorable outcomes, with normal knee range of motion and angulation, gait, and quadriceps strength on exam. Discussion: CRIF is often overlooked in the surgical treatment of displaced tibial tubercle fractures. It is a less invasive treatment option for such fractures and has advantages such as less bleeding, avoiding a tourniquet, and shorter operative duration. Patients treated with either ORIF and CRIF healed with similar rates of complications and had a satisfactory outcome. Given the rarity of associated meniscal or ligamentous injuries, open reduction to visualize the joint surface might not be needed for most patients. The two most common associated injuries, patellar tendon tears and compartment syndrome, can be preliminarily diagnosed pre-operatively. Conclusion: Closed reduction could be initially attempted for tibial tubercle fractures, even ones with intraarticular extension. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Outcomes of functional treatment versus open reduction and internal fixation of condylar mandibular fracture with articular impact: A retrospective study of 83 adults	JOURNAL OF STOMATOLOGY ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article						Condylar process fracture; Functional treatment; ORIF	CLOSED TREATMENT; FOLLOW-UP; DISLOCATED FRACTURES; SURGICAL-MANAGEMENT; HEAD FRACTURES; NECK FRACTURES; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; CHILDREN; COMPLICATIONS; MULTICENTER	Introduction: The treatment of fractures in the mandibular condylar process remains controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the outcomes of isolated functional treatment versus open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of mandibular condylar fracture with articular impact based on clinical and radiological criteria. Materials and methods: Eighty-three patients with a mandibular condylar fracture with articular impact were included in this retrospective study. They were divided according to Loukota, Spiessl and Schroll, Mercier and Rasse, Neff, and Hlawitschka classifications. Two groups were created: operated patients (operated) and non-operated patients (non-operated). Occlusal and functional features were evaluated using clinical measurements at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the treatment as well as radiological measurements performed preoperatively, 6 weeks later, and at the end of the follow-up. Results: A male predominance was observed in the data (69.9%, P < 0.0001). Isolated functional treatment was applied in 55 patients (66.26%). Twenty-eight patients (33.7%) were operated upon using a pre-auricular or modified Risdon's approach. Maximal mouth opening (MMO) was lesser in "operated'' group compared to "non-operated'' group until 6 months (25.75 mm vs 31.96 mm, 34.76 mm vs 37.95 mm, 38.06 mm vs 41.87 mm respectively 1, 3 and, 6 months, P < 0.05). Results were satisfactory 1 year after treatment (41.29 mm vs 45.22 mm, P > 0.05). There was no difference concerning temporo-mandibular joint dysfunctions between operated and non-operated patients. For unilateral fractures, the loss of height of the ramus was significantly higher in operated patients initially compared to "non-operated'' group (P = 0.0137). After surgical correction, there was no difference between the two sides of mandible. At the end of the follow-up, the there was no difference between operated and non-operated ramus (P = 0.1304 and 0.6420). Conclusion: The present study showed that a properly followed isolated functional treatment provided similar clinical results to ORIF for mandibular condylar fractures with articular impact. Surgical treatment should be preferred when the loss of height of the ramus is severe to restore the ramus height since adult condylar remodeling is less efficient than in children.

However, difficulty in removing LHSs is relatively common, and such cases can require long surgical procedures or use of special removal equipment. The purpose of this study was to report the incidence and risk factors for difficult removal of LHSs. During the 5-year-6-month period from April 2006 to September 2011, 83 locking plates containing a total of 482 LHSs were removed in 80 patients at our institution. Out of 482 LHSs, there were 118 LHSs with a 2.4-2.7 mm diameter, 308 LHSs with a 3.5 mm diameter and 56 LHSs with a 5.0 mm diameter. The incidence of removal difficulty was examined on the basis of screw diameter. In addition, the risk factors were assessed in only LHSs with a 3.5 mm diameter. LHSs with a 3.5 mm diameter were divided into 2 groups, the difficult removal group and the easy removal group, and the data were examined based on age, sex, time between insertion and removal, and screw position. The incidence of removal difficulty in LHSs with a 3.5 mm diameter was examined every 6 months between insertion and removal. Difficulty in removal was encountered in none (0 %) of 118 LHSs with a 2.4-2.7 mm diameter, 15 (4.9 %) of 308 LHSs with a 3.5 mm diameter, and none (0 %) of 56 LHSs with a 5.0 mm diameter. In only LHSs with a 3.5 mm diameter, the mean ages of the patients in the difficult removal group and the easy removal group were 32.1 and 45.6 years, respectively. The average time between insertion and removal in the difficult removal group and the easy removal group was 529.2 and 389.2 days, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in age and time between insertion and removal. Removal was difficult in 15 (9.1 %) of 165 LHSs with a 3.5 mm diameter in those with > 1 year between insertion and removal. This study suggests that (1) the use of LHSs with a 3.5 mm diameter is a necessary condition for difficulty in screw removal, and that (2) longer time from internal fixation to removal, and (3) younger age, are risk factors for it. When removing LHSs with a 3.5 mm diameter, appropriate instruments and sufficient training are necessary.

Mason type III radial head fractures treated by anatomic radial head arthroplasty: Is this a safe treatment option?	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Radial head fractures; Replacement; Arthroplasty; MEPS; Mason; Complications	POSTTRAUMATIC HETEROTOPIC OSSIFICATION; MEAN FOLLOW-UP; PROSTHETIC DESIGN; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; RISK-FACTORS; ELBOW; REPLACEMENT; RADIOCAPITELLAR; OUTCOMES	Background: Radial head fractures make up approximately 3% of all fractures and they are the most common elbow fracture in adults. Replacement through arthroplasty is the recommended treatment in the context of unstable elbow injury and comminuted radial head fracture. The midterm clinical, functional, and radiographic results in patients treated with anatomic radial head arthroplasty for a Mason type III radial head fracture are presented. Material and methods: We performed a retrospective search of our facility's prospective trauma database to identify all skeletally mature patients who were treated by primary radial head replacement or open reduction and internal fixation following an acute radial head fracture. Inclusion criteria were Mason type III fractures and anatomic radial head arthroplasty (RHA). All the patients included were evaluated using a standard postoperative protocol including clinical and radiographic evaluation at 1, 3 and 12 months of follow-up. All the patients were reviewed clinically at an average of 30 months' follow-up. Results: Forty-one subjects (32 Mason type III and 9 Mason IV fractures) were treated with anatomic RHA (Acumed, Hillsboro, OR, USA). Of these, two patients (1 Mason type III and 1 Mason type IV) were excluded from the analysis because severe cognitive impairment. Moreover, we decided to exclude the subjects with a Mason type IV fracture to obtain a more homogeneous sample. Therefore, 31 patients with a Mason type III fracture were included in this study. Based on the Mayo Elbow Performance Score, excellent results were obtained in 24 (77%) patients, good in 3 (10%) and fair in 4 (13%) patients. Heterotopic ossification was reported in 8 patients (26% of cases). The final elbow flexion-extension range of motion was of 112 degrees, with a mean flexion of 125 degrees. The final forearm rotational range of motion was 134 degrees with a mean pronation of 68 degrees and a mean supination of 66 degrees. Discussion: Anatomic radial head replacement leads to a good functional recovery, even in the presence of severe instability, such as coronoid fractures and LUCL injury. However, patients should be informed of the high number of adverse events (mainly heterotopic ossification) following this treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

This is different from the declining trend observed in the overall injury rate, and the reason for the increase is not known. Diaphyseal forearm fractures comprise 3-6% of all paediatric fractures, and they offer a challenge to their treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of diaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures in children during the last decade in Northern Finland. Another objective was to study the background factors, treatment, and re-displacement of these fractures. Materials and methods: All 168 children (<16 years) admitted to our paediatric trauma centre due to diaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures during 2000-2009 were included. The type of injury, background factors, radiographics, treatments and re-dislocations were reviewed. The age-related incidence rates were evaluated. Results: The incidence of diaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures increased 4.4-fold (95% CI 2.0-10.8; P < 0.001) between 2000 (8.2/100 000) and 2009 (35.9/100 000). The increase in the incidence was accelerating (P < 0.001) and the overall increase was 338%. The incidence of surgical treatment for diaphyseal fractures increased 4.2-fold (95% CI 1.9-10.4, P = 0.001), which is in relation to increasing number of fractures. However, internal fixation increased from 13.3% in 2000-2001 to 52.7% in 2008-2009 (P = 0.015), as an alternative to conservative treatment. The re-displacement rate was high (29.9%) amongst the patients with conservative treatment compared to those who were invasively operated (1.4%) (P < 0.001). The mean age of the patients increased by 2.4 years in the study period (P = 0.019). Trampoline was the most important and still increasing reason for the fractures. At the beginning of the study, there were no trampoline-related fracture, but towards the end of the study 30-41% of the fractures were caused by a trampoline injury (P = 0.004). Conclusions: There was an accelerating increase in the incidence of paediatric diaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures during the last decade. Trampoline was the most important and still increasing reason for these fractures. The mean age of the patients was increasing. Increasing proportion of diaphyseal both-bone forearm fractures was treated operatively. Re-displacement was unusual amongst operated cases. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study compared the risk of mechanical failure during the first year after PHILOS treatment of proximal humerus fractures (PHF) without (control group) and with (augmented group) screw augmentation. Secondary objectives were to report shoulder functions, quality of life (QoL), adverse events (AEs), and reoperation rates.Materials and methodsThis multicenter randomized trial enrolled patients aged65years with displaced/unstable PHF from eight European centers. Randomization was performed during surgery through sealed opaque envelopes. Mechanical failures were assessed by two independent reviewers via radiographs, shoulder function by Quick DASH, SPADI, and Constant Murley scores, and QoL by EQ-5D. Follow-ups were planned at postoperative 6weeks, 3, 6, and 12months.ResultsThe preliminary analysis of 6-week radiographs of the first 59 enrolled patients suggested a mechanical failure rate lower than expected and the difference between groups was too small to be detected by the planned sample size of 144. The trial was prematurely terminated after 67 patients had been enrolled: 34 (27 eligible) in the control group and 33 (29 eligible) in the augmented group. Follow-ups were performed as planned. Nine patients had mechanical failures and the failure rates (95% CI) were: augmented group, 16.1% (5.5; 33.7); control group, 14.8% (4.2; 33.7); the relative risk (95% CI) for the augmented group was 1.09 (0.32; 3.65) compared to the control group (p=1.000). No statistically significant differences in shoulder function, QoL, and AEs were observed between study groups at 1year. Nine patients (15.8%) underwent a revision.ConclusionsDue to premature termination, the study was underpowered. A larger study will be necessary to determine if cement augmentation lowers the risk of mechanical failure rate.

Head-shaft angle changes during internal and external shoulder rotations: 2-D angulation in 3-D space	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Proximal humerus fracture; Head-shaft angle; Proximal humerus; Humeral internal rotation; Humeral external rotation; CAD; 3D analysis	PROXIMAL HUMERAL FRACTURE; 3-DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; X-RAY; CLASSIFICATION; RELEVANCE; FIXATION; MALUNION; FAILURE; ANATOMY	Introduction: Restoration of native head-shaft angle (HSA) is critical for treatment of proximal humerus fracture. However, HSA has not been properly investigated according to the humeral rotation. This study was designed to analyze the relationship between the humeral rotation and the HSA at 1 increments, and clarify its serial changing pattern according to the humeral rotation. Hypothesis: The angulation of HSA would be undervalued when the humerus is being rotated externally and it would be overvalued when it is being rotated internally. Materials and methods: Eight dried cadaveric normal humeri were CT scanned. They were analyzed using computer-aided design with a standardized neutral position. HSA was the angle between the humeral shaft axis (SA) and the humeral head axis (HA). SA and HA were the best-fit lines through center of all the best-fitting circles in every cross section along the humeral shaft and within the humeral head, respectively. Each 3D model was rotated 30 degrees internally and 45 degrees externally relatives to the SA at 1 degrees increments with the camera was fixed at antero-posterior view of neutral position. Angulation of HSA in every rotational degree was documented as ratio relatives to the angulation of HSA in neutral position. Results: The average HSA at neutral position was 133 +/- 1.93 degrees HSA was underestimated by 8 +/- 1.9% and it was overestimated by 20 +/- 5.1% at the maximum external rotation (ER) and internal rotation (IR), respectively. HSA was underestimated by 1% in every 5.8 degrees of ER and overestimated by 1% in every 1.5 degrees of IR. Rotational misalignments within 10 degrees of IR and 18 degrees of ER could be tolerated (P >.05). Conclusions: HSA was underestimated at ER and was overestimated at IR. This information could be useful for surgeons in restoring the native HSA for treatment of proximal humerus fracture.

During soil development, bacteria and fungi can be differentially affected by changes in soil biogeochemistry. Since the chemistry of parent material affects soil pH, nutrient availability, and indirectly litter quality, we hypothesize that parent material has an important influence on microbial community patterns during long-term soil development. In this paper, we tested for the effect of parent material, as well as, soil and litter properties upon microbial community patterns in three c. 20000-year-old semi-arid chronosequences developed on sedimentary and volcanic (i.e. Andesitic and Dacitic) soils in the Dry Puna of Bolivia. We evaluated microbial patterns by analysing the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism from amplified bacterial 16S rRNA genes, and the fungal internal transcribed spacer region, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. 2. Soil and litter characteristics differed significantly between the Sedimentary and volcanic chronosequences. In particular, soil pH was alkaline in all stages of the Sedimentary chronosequence; whereas it changed from alkaline to near neutral across stages in both volcanic chronosequences. Composition of bacterial communities changed across volcanic chronosequences, and this change was associated with a reduction in soil pH and increases in litter quality, whereas no differences were found in the Sedimentary chronosequence. Fungal community composition, in contrast, did not change across any chronosequence. 4. Relative microbial abundance, expressed as the fungal:bacterial ratio, declined across stages of the Sedimentary chronosequence in association with decreases in TC and TP, whereas in the Andesitic chronosequence decreases in fungal:bacterial ratios were related with increases in litter quality and declines in soil pH. 5. Synthesis. Our results show the importance of parent material in affecting bacterial and fungal communities during soil development. Further, in semi-arid chronosequences, fungal:bacterial ratios tend to decline given that soil pH in young soils is rather alkaline. Our results also are consistent with the general framework that highlights the importance of above-ground (i.e. litter quality) and below-ground (i.e. soil properties) in affecting microbial relative abundance and community composition during soil development.

Fractures of the distal humerus operated on using the Lambda® plate: Report of 75 cases at 9.5 years follow-up	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Fracture; Distal humerus; Plate; Osteosynthesis	TOTAL ELBOW ARTHROPLASTY; INTERNAL-FIXATION; INTRAARTICULAR FRACTURES; OPEN REDUCTION; ULNAR NERVE; INTERCONDYLAR FRACTURES; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; OLECRANON OSTEOTOMY; COMPLEX FRACTURES; ELDERLY-PATIENTS	Introduction: The study sought to assess the functional results and complications of osteosynthesis using the Lambda (R) plate (Zimmer, Etupes, France) in treating fracture of the distal extremity of the humerus. Materials and methods: The initial series comprised 115 patients (116 fractures), treated between 1992 and 2008. Forty-one (mainly foreigners) were lost to follow-up. The final series thus comprised 74 patients (75 fractures): 44 female and 30 male, with a mean age of 46 +/- 23 years (range, 16-95 years), 22 (29%) being aged 65 years or over. According to AO classification, 22 of the fractures of the distal extremity of the humerus (29%) were diaphyseal-metaphyseal, corresponding to a particular grade of type A2, 12 (16%) were type A2 or A3, six (8%) type B, and 35 (47%) type C. Eight were open fractures: seven grade 1 and one grade IIa on Gustilo's classification. The Lambda (R) plate is an inverted Y shape, with a stem of up to ten holes and sectile arms that can be remodeled to adapt perfectly to the type of fracture and the shape of the distal end of the humerus. A posterior approach was used in all cases: in 26 cases, an extra-articular transolecranal approach and otherwise a transtricipital approach, either vertical for diaphyseal-metaphyseal fracture or inverted V for type-C fracture. Results: Mean follow-up was 115 +/- 64 months (range, 24-227 months). There were no cases of infection, non-union of olecranial osteotomy or disassembly of the internal fixation; there was, on the other hand, one case of non-union of the lateral condyle and one of the distal extremity of the humerus, two cases of dysesthesia in the ulnar nerve territory and one in the radial nerve territory (following preoperative paralysis), and four cases of stiffness requiring surgical arthrolysis between 6 and 12 months postoperatively. At follow-up, mean active elbow flexion was 133 degrees +/- 13 degrees (range, 90 degrees - 150 degrees) and active extension -12 degrees +/- 14 degrees (range, -45 degrees -0 degrees). Mean elbow flexion range of motion exceeded 100 degrees in 58 patients (77%), was between 50 degrees and 100 degrees in 16 (21%) and was less than 50 degrees in one. Mean Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) was 97 +/- 7 points (range, 40-100), and mean Quick DASH Score (converted as a score out of100) was 10 +/- 18 (range, 0-54). There were 67 excellent results (MEPS, 90-100 points), five good (75-89), two moderate and one poor. The 35 type-C fractures displayed no significantdifferences from the series as a whole (P = 1.24 for MEPS). Conclusion: Osteosynthesis using the Lambda (R) plate gave excellent medium-term results interms of both fixation stability and recovery of elbow function after fracture of the distal extremity of the humerus, even in elderly osteoporotic patients.

J	Liu, Z; Zheng, JH; Yuan, N; Miao, J				Liu, Zhen; Zheng, Ji-Hui; Yuan, Na; Miao, Jun			Comparison of the clinical effects of lamina replantation and screw fixation after laminectomy in the treatment of intraspinal tumours	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND RESEARCH			English	Article						Lamina replantation; Tumour resection; Intraspinal tumours; Internalfixation; Pedicle screw	BACK SURGERY SYNDROME; ADJACENT SEGMENT DEGENERATION; SPINAL-CORD STIMULATION; FUSION; HEMILAMINOPLASTY	Introduction Intraspinal tumours are common diseases in neurosurgery and spinal surgery. Due to the fact that most of them are benign tumours, surgical resection is usually effective, and it is also the main treatment for these tumours. To maintain the stability of the spine and to reduce the incidence of kyphosis, pedicle screw fixation is required after traditional laminectomy, but there are many complications. In recent years, tumour resection and laminectomy have become increasingly favoured by clinicians. However, the comparison of the clinical effects of lamina complex replantation and pedicle screw fixation after laminectomy in the treatment of intraspinal tumours is still unknown. This paper systematically compared the two methods from many aspects and discussed their advantages and disadvantages to obtain better clinical guidance. Materials and methods In this study, a retrospective analysis was conducted to select 58 patients who underwent posterior approach tumour resection in the spinal surgery department of our hospital from January 2017 to January 2020. Among them, 32 patients underwent tumour resection and laminoplasty, and 26 patients underwent tumour resection and screw internal fixation. The age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, duration of symptoms, operation time, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, amount of bleeding and other data were summarized, calculated and compared. Results 1. The age, sex, BMI, smoking status and symptom duration of the two groups were compared. The above-mentioned results were not statistically significant. 2. The operation time, hospital stay, postoperative complications, intraoperative bleeding and adjacent segment degeneration (ASD) were counted and compared between the two groups. There was no significant difference in hospital stay or intraoperative bleeding between the two groups; in addition, the operation time, postoperative complications and incidence of ASD were statistically significant. 3. The visual analog scale (VAS) score, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score of thoracic and lumbar spines and Neck Disability Index (NDI) score of cervical spine patients in the two groups were counted, and the preoperative and post-operative data, as well as their changes, were counted and compared between groups and within groups. There was no statistical significance between the two groups; moreover, the postoperative scores were all significantly lower than preoperative in the group. 4. According to the spinal cord function ASIA grade, the preoperative, final follow-up and change values of the two groups were counted, and intragroup and intergroup comparisons were made. There was no significant difference between the two groups; in addition, the scores of the final follow-up were significantly higher than preoperative in the group. 5. The spinal mobility was measured and recorded before the operation and at the final follow-up. There was no significant difference between preoperative and postoperative cervical mobility, and there was no statistical significance observed; furthermore, the range of flexion, extension, rotation and lateral bending of the thoracic and lumbar spines in the screw fixation group was significantly lower than that in the lamina replantation group. Conclusions Lamina replantation can be used as splendid methods for the treatment of Intraspinal tumour. Lamina replantation can reduce the operation time, as well as reduce the occurrence of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage, iatrogenic spinal stenosis, posterior soft tissue adhesion and ASD. These complications are reduced in comparison to the other mode of management and better preserve the mobility of the spine.

The nano-sized HAp powder was synthesised and Mg-2Mn-1.5Zn (MZ21) and Mg-2Mn-1.5Zn/1HAp (MZ21/HAp) metal matrix nanocomposites were developed using vacuum-assisted stir casting process in Ar-SF6 protected environment. The chemical conversion coatings of ZnP were prepared on fabricated composites using Teflon lined stainless steel with zinc phosphate-based reaction solution. X-ray diffraction was used to assess the interaction of Mn and Zn on Mg crystal lattice. Microstructural observations were made using optical and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Mechanical properties were determined using tensile, hardness and dynamic mechanical analysis. Tensile yield and ultimate strengths of the MZ21 (60.31 +/- 0.24 MPa, 142.83 +/- 18.40 MPa) and MZ21/HAp (73.41 +/- 2.24 MPa, 139.65 +/- 16.16 MPa) showed a two-fold increase compared to pure Mg (30.36 +/- 2.66 MPa, 73 +/- 5.74 MPa). In-vitro studies indicated 10 % and 59 % improvement in cell viability, and 60 % and 33 % reduction in hemolysis rate respectively for MZ21 and MZ21/HAp by employing ZnP, and its bioactivity resulted in increased cell attachment. The effectiveness of the material was biomechanically evaluated and analysed using finite element approach. The results indicated that the developed composites reduced the mechanically shielded region and could provide enhanced healing in transverse tibial shaft fracture.

Materials and methods: This study consists of two parts: a clinical retrospective study and a randomized controlled biomechanical test. For the clinical study, a retrospective analysis of posterior pelvic ring fractures was performed between June 2015 and May 2020. Eighteen patients underwent surgery using two TightRope (R) systems to fix a broken posterior pelvic ring because of unstable AO type C1 and C2 pelvic ring fractures. The patients were followed up for at least 2 years, and all patients were evaluated using the Majeed scoring system and vertical displacement. In the biomechanical tests, six embalmed adult pelvic specimens were used. The fractures were subjected to TightRope (R), IS screw, and TBP fixation in a randomized block design. The specimens were placed in a biomechanical testing machine in a standing neutral posture. A cyclic vertical load of up to 500 N was applied, and the displacement of the specimens was recorded by the testing machine. The ultimate load in each group of specimens was recorded. The displacement and ultimate load were compared and analyzed by statistical methods. Results: At a mean follow-up of 38.89 +/- 8.72 months, the functional Majeed score was excellent in 14 patients and good in four patients. The final radiological examinations showed that the outcome was excellent in 14 patients and good in four patients. In these patients, no serious clinical complications were found. Weight-bearing was delayed in four patients. In biomechanical tests, the displacement of the specimens fixed with TightRope (R) was significantly lower than that of the specimens fixed with TBP (P < 0.05) when the load ranged from 300 to 500 N. The displacement in the IS screw group was significantly lower than that in either the TBP or TightRope (R) group (P < 0.05) when the load ranged from 0 to 500 N. The ultimate load in the IS screw group (1798 +/- 83.53 N) was significantly greater than that in the TBP group (1352 +/- 74.41 N) (t = 9.78, P < 0.0001) and the TightRope (R) group (1347 +/- 54.28 N) (t = 11.11, P < 0.0001). However, no significant difference was observed between the TightRope (R) and TBP groups (t = 0.13, P = 0.90). Conclusion: Percutaneous posterior TightRope (R) system shows strong stability in mechanical experiments and shows good results in clinical follow-up while this system has certain advantages in lower surgical requirements and lower risk of related nerve and vascular structural damage.

Hydrocephalus shunt therapy: current titanium shunt valve implants obstructed by internal tissue proliferations identified as extracellular matrix membranes	CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM			English	Article						Hydrocephalus; Titanium shunt valve; Extracellular matrix; Astrocytes; Microglia	CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID	Purpose Shunt valves, required for treatment of hydrocephalus, demand for high performance rates and lifelong excellent function. To overcome problems with traditional silicone materials, adjustable and gravity-adapted titanium valves were developed. Even modern shunt valve systems are still subject to occlusion. The aim of the present study was to investigate dysfunctional silicone and titanium valves for presence of cellular and proteinous materials inside the housings by means of histopathology. Methods A total of 19 explanted shunt valves from children between 2 and 182 months of age were investigated following dysfunction. After fixation in formalin and embedding in hard resin, slices were ground to a thickness of 5-30 mu. Besides standard histology, immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies with markers for microglia, astrocytes, platelets, monocytes, and the proteins laminin, fibronectin, and collagen IV. Results Traces, layers, and plaques could be demonstrated in every investigated silicone or titanium valve with an implantation time of more than 6 days. Most of the tissue was found adjacent to silicone and titanium surfaces of the inner housing, the adjustment rotor, and ball-in-cone core. Markers for micro and astroglia stained positive in 40-60% of the specimen, mostly demonstrating a proteinous layer positive for laminin (80%), fibronectin (30%), and collagen IV (30%). Conclusions Tissue reactions with formation of cellular and proteinous matrix components are common in obstructed silicone and titanium shunt valves. The tissue mimics astrocytic repair mechanisms genuine for basilar membrane matrix. The knowledge of these typical arachnoid patterns of colonization is a prerequisite for developing future shunt devices.	[Ludwig, H. C.; Reitemeyer, M.; Bock, H.

Patients and Methods: Thirteen patients who suffered orbital blowout fractures, with >= 2 cm(2) bony defects in the inferior orbital wall, took part in the study. The inferior orbital wall was explored via subconjunctival approach. After repositioning of orbital content, each inferior orbital wall was reconstructed using a round plate of P(L/DL)LA 70/30. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging coronal sections were undertaken before the operation and 2 and 36 weeks postoperatively. Results: The magnetic resonance imaging Studies showed no abnormal tissue foreign body reactions in the orbital region. The material showed adequate strength to stabilize bone segments during the critical period of bone healing. The bone healing seems to take place along the bone fragments. The clinical outcome was excellent in 11 of the 13 cases (85%). At the end of the study, only one patient had mild enophthalmos. Conclusions: Bioresorbable P(L/DL)LA 70/30 implants are safe and reliable for the repair of large defects (>= 2 cm(2)) in the inferior orbital wall. It seems that this is the first reported biodegradable material, in the literature, to promote bone healing along the bone fragments of the inferior orbital wall.

The Use of Triphasic Bone Graft for the Treatment of Pediatric Bone Cysts: Experience at 2 Institutions	ORTHOPEDICS			English	Article							PERCUTANEOUS INJECTION; MARROW; METHYLPREDNISOLONE; MATRIX	Unicameral/aneurysmal bone cysts can lead to pain, fracture, and limb deformity. In this study, the authors evaluated the outcome of triphasic bone graft to treat unicameral/aneurysmal bone cysts. They retrospectively evaluated 41 immature patients from a prospectively enrolled cohort from 2 institutions treated from May 9, 2007, to November 1, 2014. Medical record review and evaluation of radiographs and computed tomography scans were performed. The authors characterized replacement of the material by normal bone or recurrent cyst at final follow-up. They recorded rates of fractures and complications after treatment. Twenty-nine patients were treated in Wisconsin, and 12 patients were treated in Florida. Average follow-up was 2.8 years. At follow-up, 13 of 41 patients had cyst recurrence. Three patients had fracture after initial treatment; 2 were treated surgically. Two of 9 patients with extraosseous bone graft had soft tissue swelling, and 1 required debridement. Complications did not differ by cyst type, location, sex, age, or use of internal fixation. For 27 patients with at least 2-year follow-up, percent fill of triphasic bone graft at initial surgery correlated with rate of recurrence at final follow-up: 15 of 27 patients with no cyst recurrence at final follow-up had a mean of 100% initial fill, and 12 of 27 with cyst recurrence at final follow-up had a mean of 90% initial fill (P=.048). Using triphasic bone graft for the treatment of unicameral/aneurysmal bone cysts, the authors observed a 7% rate of clinical recurrence (3 of 41 had fracture). Because this material has the potential to be locally inflammatory, efforts are needed to keep it within the bone.

Currently, there is limited citation analysis in oral and maxillofacial trauma surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine the 100 most cited articles in facial trauma surgery and their characteristics. Materials and Methods: Articles were identified from the Science Citation Index of the Institute for Scientific Information using the Thomson Reuters Web of Science search engine. All articles until 2015 were included. Then, the 100 most cited articles were assessed for title, author, journal, country of origin, and number of citations. A citation index (number of citations received per year) also was calculated. Results: The 100 most cited articles in facial trauma received 9,933 citations (range, 66 to 297). They were published from 1942 through 2008, with 1990 through 1999 being the commonest decade. Articles were cited on average 4.6 times per year. Articles were published in 28 different journals, with impact factors ranging from 0.94 to 35.3. Most articles were observational research studies. Conclusion: These findings reflect the attention that articles have received during the past half century in oral and maxillofacial trauma research, shedding light on often-read articles in this field. In addition to current bibliometric indices, it could provide a useful evidence base for facial surgeons, represent key educational material for aspiring trainees, and be used to help guide future research efforts.

In this study, we in situ developed the n-Bi2S3 nanorod/p-MnOS cubic composite catalyst for the first time using a one-step hydrothermal method, as MnOS, listed in the X-ray diffraction standard data file as an uncharacterized compound, has not been reported since 1965. Then, using a photodeposition technique, Ag nanoparticles (NPs) were added to the surface of the Bi2S3/MnOS to enhance PNRR via the surface plasmon resonance. After different characterization techniques for evaluation, Ag-Bi2S3/MnOS is found to be highly effective in the spatial separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs due to the charge transfer at the composite interface. Photodeposited Ag is applied as an electron trapper to enhance the spatial separation of charge carriers. Based on their ability to reduce nitrogen under simulated solar light irradiation, the PNRR activities of Bi2S3, MnOS, Bi2S3/MnOS, and 0.5 to 2 % Ag-Bi2S3/MnOS were evaluated. After two hours, the PNRR activity of 1 % Ag-Bi2S3/MnOS produced ammonia 5.9 mmol/g, double the amount of Bi2S3/MnOS composite and approximately 5 times the amounts of Bi2S3 and MnOS materials. PNRR enhancement involves the internal static electron field created at the n-type Bi2S3/p-type MnOS interface and the improved electron conductivity with the photodeposition of Ag NPs, to speed up the reaction of reactive species. The importance of solid solution engineering in material design is demonstrated in this work.

Three biodegradable alloys with different magnesium content have been studied, their production technology has been developed and the product properties have been determined. The technology includes casting, extrusion, hot and cold drawing of the wire, and the product surface finishing. The paper shows the most important stages of the process (i.e., extrusion and drawing) in detail. The technological parameters have been selected based on the results of the computer modeling. The flow stress-strain curves of extruded materials have been obtained at various strain rates and temperatures. Two drawing technologies have been compared. The first one is the room temperature conventional wire drawing. In the second one, the first few passes have been made at an elevated temperature and the rest at room temperature. This allowed avoiding the breaking of the wire during the first passes (a typical issue of the conventional technology for these alloys) and increasing the ductility of the final product. Mechanical properties, bio-corrosion, and crystallographic texture of the material were determined at different stages of the processing. A simultaneous increase in the wire strength, the number of repeated bending until the rupture of the wire, and in the bio-corrosion rate due to drawing has been registered. This phenomenon coincided with a change in the crystallographic texture. It has been shown that the product tensile strength of about 250-300 MPa can be reduced by about 30% due to surgical knots tied on it.

Methods: A finite element model of a mandible with a fracture in the body was subjected to bite loads. An analysis was run to determine the principal strain in the fracture callus and von Mises stress in a titanium plate. These values were then set as the limits within which the bioabsorbable bone plate must comply. The model then considered a bone plate made of the polymer poly(L-lactide-co-D,L-lactide) (P[L/DL] LA) 70/30. An optimization routine determined the smallest volume of bioabsorbable bone plate that can perform as well as a titanium bone plate when fixating mandibular fractures. Results: A P(L/DL) LA plate volume of 315 mm(2) with a thickness of 1.5 mm provided as much mechanical stability as a commonly used titanium strut structure of 172 mm2. The peak plate stress was well below the yield strength of the material. Conclusions: The P(L/DL) LA bioabsorbable bone plate design is as strong as a titanium plate when fixating fractures of the mandible body despite the polymer material having only 6% of the stiffness of the titanium. The P(L/DL) LA plate can be less than half the volume of its strut-style counterpart.

To address these issues, the black anti-stray light coating with enhanced conductivity on the chemical etching surface of high-silicon Al-70Si alloy were successfully fabricated by the combination of plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) technology and deposited aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO) transparent conductive film by magnetron sputtering technology. The microstructures, phase, elemental compositions, light absorption performance and electrical resistivity of coatings were tested and analyzed by SEM, EDS, XRD and XPS spectroscopy. The effects of process parameters including current density and AZO sputtering times on the structure, optical and electrical properties of the film layer were systematically studied. Convection through the fixation effect in the etched Al-70Si alloy porous layer promoted the internal heat and mass transfer during PEO process which is similar to previous reported mechanism of filling of cracks and pores by nanoparticles leading to the layer densification. The PEO coating had the highest absorptivity of 0.946 and it only decreased to 0.939 after AZO sputtering, at the same time the coating has the lowest resistivity of 1.04 x 10(7) ?/sq, indicating excellent anti-stray light and antistatic ability. This two-step route pave the way to improve the conductivity without compromising optical properties of PEO coating on the high silicon aluminum alloy (>50 wt% Si, Al-50Si) for space material.

Management of type 13C2 distal humerus fractures by olecranon osteotomy approach versus triceps sparing approach-our experience with sixty cases	INTERNATIONAL ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Intercondylar humerus fractures; Triceps sparing approach; Paratricipital approach; Olecranon osteotomy	INTERCONDYLAR FRACTURES; INTRAARTICULAR FRACTURES; ELBOW	Background Intercondylar humerus fractures (AO type 13C), though less common (less than 1%), are increasing over the last few years. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of these fractures are now well recognised and preferred management. These fractures are principally approached from posterior side and various posterior approaches have been mentioned. Triceps sparing is a relatively newer approach for fixation of these fractures. Here, we are ascertaining the outcomes of triceps sparing approach and olecranon osteotomy approach and also investigating the preferred approach in various age groups. Materials and methods A level III non-randomized retrospective comparative study was conducted with a total of 60 patients belonging to AO type 13C2 in the age group of 16-70 years, operated upon during the period of September 2013 to March 2019. They were analysed for various outcome measures and complications. MEPS and DASH were used to determine outcome. Results Out of a total of 60 patients (mean age 37.52 years), 28 were in olecranon osteotomy (OO) group and 32 were in the triceps sparing (TS) group. The mean operative time for group OO was 93.11 +/- 8.78 minutes compared with group TS where it was 77 +/- 4.64 minutes and the difference was statistically significant. Similarly, blood loss was 224 +/- 46 ml in group OO compared with 197 +/- 39 ml in group TS and it was also statistically significant. The average MEPS score was slightly better in the group TS (86.56 +/- 10.66) compared with group OO (83.57 +/- 10.96), though not statistically significant. Similarly, DASH score was 35.72 +/- 8.35 in group TS and 35.32 +/- 8.89 in group OO. The MEPS score was excellent (>= 90) in 12 patients of group OO and 16 patients of group TS, good (75-89) in 11 patients of each group and fair (60-74) in 5 patients of each group. The patients in the age group of >= 60 years tend to have inferior functional outcomes, though not statistically significant, when treated with triceps sparing approach compared with olecranon osteotomy approach.

TURKISH JOURNAL OF GERIATRICS-TURK GERIATRI DERGISI			English	Article						Hip Fractures; Geriatrics; Hemiarthroplasty, Bone Nails; Fracture Fixation, Intramedullary	HIP-FRACTURES; FIXATION; ARTHROPLASTY; MORTALITY	Introduction: The management of intertrochanteric fractures in elderly is challenging because of difficult anatomical reduction, poor bone quality and difficulty in weight bearing. Various internal fixation devices can be used for this type of fractures, and primary arthroplasty is also an option for treatment. This retrospective study compares bipolar hemiarthroplasty (BHA) with proximal femoral nail (PFN) in ambulatory elderly patients, focusing on functional results and return to premorbid level of activity. Materials and Method: The study included 136 patients who underwent operations to treat AO 31-A type intertrochanteric fractures. Patients who were not ambulatory before having fracture were excluded from the study. Of the 78 patients with 31-A1 fractures; 40 were treated with BHA, 33 were treated with PFN and 5 were treated with dynamic hip screw (DHS). Forty patients had 31-A2 type fractures; 24 were treated with BHA, 7 were treated with PFN, 5 were treated with DHS and 4 were treated with different plate-screw systems. Eighteen patients had 31-A3 type fractures; 2 were treated with BHA, 15 were treated with PFN, and 1 was treated with a plate-screw system. Patients with BHA (mean age 80.61 years; range 68-98 years) and PFN (mean age 77.59 years; range 58-94 years) were compared in the final evaluation if they had at least 1 year of follow up documented postoperatively. Results: Total perioperative blood loss was significantly lower in patients treated with PFN (590 to 390 ml). Time to surgery (4.1 vs 3.9 days), postoperative weight bearing time (2 vs 2 days), and mortality rates (16.66 % vs 18.18%) did not differ between patients treated with BHA and PFN, respectively. Total complication rate (22.4 % vs 28.2 %) was lower, and the duration of surgery (52.8 vs 82.5 min), the time to return to the premorbid daily activity (6.2 vs 8.5 weeks), Harris score (85.8 vs 81.3) and Postel Merle D'Aubigne (PMA) score (14.1 vs 12.2) were significantly better with BHA. Conclusion: Hemiarthroplasty is not associated with greater postoperative mortality compared with osteosynthesis, although the perioperative blood loss is significantly higher. However, the complication rates are lower and functional results are better; thus, hemiarthroplasty can safely be the first choice of treatment for the intertrochanteric fractures of ambulatory elderly patients.

J	Danda, AK				Danda, Anil Kumar			Comparison of a Single Noncompression Miniplate Versus 2 Noncompression Miniplates in the Treatment of Mandibular Angle Fractures: A Prospective, Randomized Clinical Trial	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							INTERNAL-FIXATION; IN-VITRO; MAXILLOMANDIBULAR FIXATION; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; COMPLICATIONS; STABILITY; SYSTEM; PLATES	Purpose: The aim of this study is to compare the postoperative complications after fixation of mandibular angle fractures with 2 noncompression miniplates, in which a single plate is fixed onto the superior border of the mandible and the other plate to the lateral aspect of the mandible, with the standard technique of a single noncompression miniplate fixed onto the superior border of the mandible. Materials and Methods: We randomly divided 54 patients with unilateral mandibular angle fractures into 2 groups, with 27 in each group. Randomization was done with lots in closed envelopes. Group I patients were treated with a single noncompression miniplate fixed at the superior border as suggested by Champy et al through an intraoral approach. Group II patients were treated with 2 noncompression miniplates in which 1 plate was fixed in a manner similar to that in group I and the other plate was fixed to the lateral aspect of the angle of the mandible with combined intraoral and transcutaneous access through a trocar and cannula. The patients were assessed for malocclusion, infection, wound dehiscence, and plate exposure. The data were analyzed statistically with the chi(2) test, and statistical analysis was performed with SPSS statistical software for Windows, version 8.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Results: Group I comprised 21 men and 6 women with a mean age of 32.4 years (range, 18-43 years). Group II comprised 23 men and 4 women with a mean age of 29.6 years (range, 21-49 years). No patients complained of malocclusion in either group. Wound dehiscence occurred in 3 patients (11.1%) in group I and 2 patients (7.4%) in group II, which was not statistically significant (chi(2) = 0.0, P > .99). Infection occurred in 1 patient (3.7%) in group I and 2 patients (7.4%) in group II, which was not statistically significant (chi(2) = 0.0, P > .99). One patient from both the groups required plate removal. Scar developed at the transcutaneous incision site in 5 patients (18.5%) in group II. Conclusion: The use of 2 noncompression miniplates for treating noncomminuted fractures of the mandibular angle does not seem to have any advantage over the use of a single plate.

This leads to significant limb shortening, fracture collapse in varus position and implant failure, which can be prevented by trochanteric wiring in addition to dynamic hip screw (DHS) fixation. The purpose of our study is to assess the outcomes of DHS augmented with trochanteric wiring in unstable type A2 intertrochanteric fractures. Materials and methods: One hundred and two retrospective cases of unstable intertrochanteric fractures treated with DHS between January 2010 and December 2015 with a minimum follow-up period of 12 months were reviewed. Out of 102 cases, 28 were treated with DHS and derotation screw alone (Group A), while in rest 74 cases trochanteric wiring was used as an augmentation to DHS and derotation screw (Group B). Patients were evaluated clinically for range of motion, Harris hip score and Oxford hip score. Radiologically, fracture reduction, change in neck shaft angle and neck length ratio in comparison to opposite hip and union status of greater trochanter were assessed. Results: The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery was 72 years (range 23-94 years) with 48 males and 54 females. The mean follow-up period was 20 months (range 12-48 months). The Harris hip score, Oxford hip score, shortening, attainment of weight bearing and change in neck shaft angle was not significantly different between the two groups (all p values > 0.05). Incidence of greater trochanter nonunion was greater in group A (17.85%) as compared to group B (6.75%). We found significant association between occurrence of limp with varus change in neck shaft angle, decrease in neck length ratio and greater trochanteric non-union (all p values < 0.05). We had 7 complications, one superficial infection, one deep vein thrombosis, 4 screw cut out and one deep infection treated with implant removal. Conclusion: DHS augmented with trochanteric wiring in unstable intertrochanteric fractures gives similar result to group without no wiring, although greater trochanter non-union rate was more in the latter group. Limp can be prevented by anatomical or valgus fixation, augmentation of DHS to support posteromedial and greater trochanteric fragments and delayed weight bearing. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Design: Retrospective review. Setting: Level I trauma center. Materials and Methods: All skeletally mature patients requiring an anterior approach for fixation of an acetabular fracture with minimum 1-year clinical and radiographic follow up were included. Charts and radiographs were reviewed for fracture pattern, time to surgery, operative time, blood loss, quality of reduction, and peri-operative complications. A consecutive group of 57 patients treated by a single surgeon using the AIP approach was identified as a subset of a larger series 536 acetabular fractures treated by the same surgeon between February 2004 and February 2008. Results: Of the 57 patients, average time to operation was 5 days and a supplemental lateral window was required in 34 patients (60%). Average blood loss was 750 mL, and average operative time was 263 minutes. One patient (1.8%) had a vascular injury requiring embolization. One patient (1.8%) had a wound infection in the lateral window, two patients (3.5%) developed a direct inguinal hernia requiring surgical repair, and one patient (1.8%) had atrophy of the ipsilateral rectus abdominus without hernia. Of the 50 patients with minimum 1-year follow up, there were 22 associated both column, 12 anterior column, seven anterior column posterior hemitransverse, six transverse, and three T-type fractures. Seventy percent of the reductions were graded excellent, 22% were graded good, and 8% poor. Clinical outcomes (Merle D'Aubigne) at 1 year were 36% excellent, 55% good, and 10% poor. Thirteen patients (26%) were noted to have significant weakness of the hip adductors (obturator nerve palsy) postoperatively; all but one resolved and improved within 6 months. Conclusion: Use of the AIP (modified Rives-Stoppa) approach for the treatment of acetabular fractures permits good to excellent reduction in the majority of cases while giving excellent visualization and access to the quadrilateral plate and posterior column. The AIP approach has a complication rate that is comparable to the ilioinguinal approach. We recommend the use of this technique as a potential alternative (but not replacement) to the classic ilioinguinal approach when anterior exposure of the acetabulum is required.	[Sagi, H.

In Vancouver type B1 there are several osteosynthesis options. The aim of this paper is to assess both the treatment and results of Vancouver type B1 PPF in patients operated at our centre. Material and Method: : An observational retrospective study of patients operated at Hospital Universi-tario Miguel Servet for type B1 PPF via osteosynthesis with plate between January 2014 and March 2017. Such details were documented and analysed as type of implant used for fixation, patient demographics, complications, time to union and function score using the Harris Hip Score. The minimum follow up was 2 years. Results: : Overall, 37 patients (21 women) were available for review with a mean age of 80.7 years (range 54-99). 8 of these patients died, with an average age of 85.6 (83-95). Out of these 8 dead pa-tients, 4 died in the first year, with an average age of 87 (83-95). 19 fractures had cemented stems whereas 18 were uncemented. According to prosthesis type, 8 had a cemented partial arthroplasty, 11 a cemented total hip arthroplasty (THA), 18 a non-cemented THA; with an average period until PPF of 2.5 years (0.2-5.6), 7 years (0.09-18.1) and 8.1 years (2.6-12.7) respectively. Devises used for stabilisa-tion of the fracture included 27 Cable-Ready (R) plates (Zimmer-Biomet), 5 Dall-Miles (R) plates (Stryker) and 5 femur NCB (R) plates (Zimmer-Biomet). Complications included 5 acute superficial infections of sur-gical wound, 1 chronic infection, 5 pressure ulcers (4 sacral, 1 heel), 7 patients required intra-operational blood transfusion. The mean time to union was 10.35 weeks (range 6-13). The mean Harris Hip Score postoperatively was 65 (4 4-95). Discussion: : Treatment via open reduction and internal fixation with locked lateral plate covering most of the femur in elderly patients or those with poor bone quality, or a plate with proximal cerclages and distal screws in patients with better bone quality are appropriate treatment methods. To achieve good results using these techniques, we consider minimisation of soft tissue dissection highly important likewise using a meticulous osteosynthesis technique with special attention to biology and biomechanics.

Changing the fixation stiffness through the course of healing might accelerate bone healing and prevent healing complications. Shape memory alloy (SMA) based implants were developed to allow for non-invasive stiffness alteration during the fracture healing process. To gain a deeper understanding of the implant functionality based on the alloy characteristics and geometric design, the mechanical properties of different shape memory alloys where mechanically characterized. SMA bone plates were manufactured and the structural bending stiffness of the implants was determined at different temperatures and configurations. The temperature required for complete recovery of shape after deformation increased continuously with increasing pseudo-plastic deformation in SMA probes. Full recovery was observed at temperatures ranging from 38 degrees C to 52 degrees C after pseudo-plastic deformations ranging from 0.2% to 1.0% outer fibre strain, respectively. The small fragment inverse-dynamisation implants revealed bending stiffnesses ranging from 0.09 N m(2) to 0.34 N m(2) in the initial state and from 0.16 N m(2) to 0.46 N m(2) after shape alteration. Dependent on the design, a relative gain of the implant stiffness ranging from 18.8% to 115.0% could be observed. The large inverse-dynamisation implants revealed bending stiffnesses from 3.7 N m(2) to 7.1 N m(2) before and 4.1 N m(2) to 12.6 N m(2) after triggering the shape memory effect. Dependent on the design a gain in stiffness from 11.8% to 117.2% was observed. Warming the SMA implant to 40 degrees C for a short period of time, leads to a moderate increase in implant stiffness of up to 64.5%, while triggering the implant with 50 degrees C leads to a maximum increase in stiffness of up to 127.3%. The Nitinol shape memory bone plates have a huge potential for improving the treatment of long shaft fractures by allowing for the increase, decrease or incremental change of implant stiffness in fracture stabilization. However, the interaction between design, material properties, and manufacturing processes need to be carefully considered for each specific application to achieve optimum function of SMA-based, stiffness altering, fracture-fixation implants.

Different methods have been described to determine the size of the femoral head fragment, as a small head has been said to be associated with poor outcome and nonunion due to inadequate implant purchase in the proximal fragment. These methods were two dimensional and were affected by radiography techniques, therefore did not determine true head size. Computed tomography (CT) is an important option to measure true head size as images can be obtained in three dimensions. Henceforth, we subjected patients to CT scan of hip in cases with displaced fracture neck of femur. The study aims to define the term "small head or inadequate size femoral head" objectively for its prognostic significance. Materials and Methods: 70 cases of displaced femoral neck fractures underwent CT scan preoperatively for proximal femoral geometric measurements of both hips. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scan was done in all cases. Patients were treated with either intertrochanteric osteotomy or lag screw osteosynthesis based on the size of the head fragment on plain radiographs. Results: The average femoral head fragment volume was 57 cu cm (range 28.3-84.91 cu cm; standard deviation 14 cu cm). Proximal fragment volume of > 43 cu cm was termed adequate size (type I) and of %43 cu cm as small femoral head (type II). Fractures which united (n = 54) had a relatively large average head size (59 cu cm) when compared to fractures that did not (n = 16), which had a small average head size (49 cu cm) and this difference was statistically significant. In type I fractures union rate was comparable in both osteotomy and lag screw groups (P > 0.05). Lag screw fixation failed invariably, while osteotomy showed good results in type II fractures (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Computed tomography scan of the proximal femur is advisable for measuring true size of head fragment. An objective classification based on the femoral head size (type I and type II) is proposed. Osteosynthesis should be the preferred method of treatment in type I and osteotomy or prosthetic replacement is the method of choice for type II femoral neck fractures.

We sought to develop a model that utilize the combination of both these techniques to improve current tools for anatomical research, teaching and preoperative surgical planning, particularly addressing the venous system of the brain.Materials and methodsSeven ethanol-fixed human cadaveric heads and one arm were injected with a latex-barium mixture into the internal jugular veins and the brachial artery. After the ethanol-based fixation, specimens were scanned by high-resolution cone-beam CT and images were post-processed on a 3D-workstation. Subsequent, microsurgical dissections were performed by an experienced neurosurgeon and venous anatomy was compared with relevant 3D venograms.ResultsLatex-barium mixtures resulted in a homogenous cast with filling of the cerebral venous structures down to 150 & mu;m in diameter. The ethanol-based preparation of the cadaveric brains allowed for near-realistic microsurgical maneuverability during dissection. The model improves assessment of the venous system for anatomical education and hands-on surgical training.ConclusionTo our knowledge we describe the first preparation method which combines near-realistic microsurgical dissection of human heads with high-resolution 3D imaging of the cerebral venous system in the same specimens.

Promising results of initial clinical trials with yttria-stabilized zirconia have led to more extensive use of zirconia in dental implant superstructures. The applications have extended to abutments and complex individually designed crownabutment one-piece structures. Little is known about their clinical success and the primary cause of failures. Purpose. The aim of this study was to identify the cause of fracture of retrieved implant retained one-piece prostheses that failed during clinical use. Methods. Nine fractured restorations were analyzed with fractographic methods and their fracture origins were identified. Results. All but two of the fractures originated in an area of tight contact between the implant or titanium screw and the abutment base. Results of the evaluation showed that zirconia-based implant restorations with very thin walls in the region connecting the prosthesis to the implant are vulnerable to damage from the screw retaining process and fracture from nonaxial loads. Two restorations failed due to veneer fractures. Significance. The findings suggest that large crowns on narrow implants or implants with internal fixation should preferably not be made with zirconia abutments, or that a new design approach should be considered.

Because of its extremely low incidence, little is known about its clinical features. In this retrospective study, we aim to analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with CPT. Materials and methodsThis is a retrospective study of children with CPT identified by the radiological review. Investigations of CPT included general conditions, the characteristics of CPT, treatment methods, and surgical complications. ResultsWe collected 514 CPT cases from March 1999 to March 2020 in our hospital, such as 317 (61.67%) boys, 197 (38.33%) girls; 330 (62.86%) in Crawford IV; 510 (97.14%) in mid and distal 1/3 tibia; 481 (93.58%) in less than 3 years at onset age; 297 (57.78%) in less than 3 years at the first outpatient visit. The most common post-operative complication was ankle valgus (101, 39.60%), followed by limb length discrepancy (91, 35.69%), refracture (38, 14.90%), osteomyelitis (15, 5.88%), and removal of internal fixation (10, 3.93%). ConclusionsCPT with a higher incidence of Crawford IV frequently occurs in boys and the middle or distal part of the tibia; most patients have the onset age and first outpatient visit before 3 years; the major surgical complications are ankle valgus and limb length discrepancy.

Anatomical structure classification of medial malleolus at home and abroad is reported rarely. Hence, this morphological study is mainly designed to investigate the anatomical morphological classification and clinical significance of medial malleolus based on computed tomography (CT) three--dimensionalreconstruction.Materials and methods: From October 2018 to January 2021, 373 patients who underwent CT examination of malleolus medialis joint in the Jiang'an Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine were observed. The medial malleolus was observed and classified; then, geometric parameters were measured according to different medial malleolus types.Results: According to the results of 373 cases, medial malleolus can be divided into four types: omega type (66%), radical sign type (16%), inverted triangle type (14%), and wave type (4%).Conclusions: There are four main shapes: omega, inverted triangle, radical sign, and wave in the medial malleolus of all normal ankles. The measurement of medial malleolus parameters according to medial malleolus in different shapes was of importance to guide smooth operation of medial malleolus fixation and deltoid lig-ament reconstruction and epidemiological.

Following the testing philosophy of ASTM F382 and ISO 9585, we have developed standardized quasi-static and dynamic testing methods for straight linear and anatomically shaped plates, including locked type and conventional systems. The test specification comprises torsion and bending tests along the implant axis and therefore modifies and extends the methods proposed by ASTM F382. We present specific test setups in order to determine product-specific characteristics of the mechanical construct, consisting of the bone plate with corresponding screws (such as construct stiffness, yield strength, ultimate strength and fatigue properties) under the condition that it is rigidly fixed to "healthy bone". We also address specific testing requirements that are important for the purpose of standardization, such as the positioning of the construct for testing or the number of screws in the diaphysis and metaphysis. Finally, we define the outcome parameters and associated failure criteria related to quasi-static and dynamic testing for comparative purposes. This paper does not intend to replace biomechanical testing of those devices under physiological loading conditions.

Acromial base fractures after reverse total shoulder arthroplasty: report of five cases	JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY			English	Article						Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty; acromial base fracture	PROXIMAL HUMERAL FRACTURES; ROTATOR CUFF DEFICIENCY; STRESS-FRACTURE; PROSTHESIS	Background: Most series of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) have reported acromial fractures, but they have not been shown to alter reported outcomes in most series. We present 5 patients with acromial base fractures where the entire deltoid origin was displaced from its anatomic location. Materials and methods: Five patients with acromial base fractures after rTSA were identified and evaluated for functional outcomes and pain relief as well as results of fracture treatment. Three were treated operatively and 3 were treated nonoperatively. One nonoperative treatment eventually required open reduction and internal fixation. Results: Function was limited after fracture, with average forward elevation of only 43 degrees but which improved to 84 degrees after fracture union. Pain was significant after the fracture (6.8 of 10) and improved with fracture healing (0.8 of 10). Neer Functional Outcome scores after fracture union averaged 62 of 100, consistent with unsatisfactory results. Conclusion: Acromial base fractures after rTSA are a painful and disabling complication. The outcomes appear different in this series than in other series describing acromial fractures. This may be a result of the different anatomic location of the fractures. Pain improves with fracture union, but functional returns are unpredictable.

To evaluate the effect of Co-60 irradiation on the properties of it, chitosan rod was irradiated at doses from 10 kGy to 200 kGy. FT-IR, Ubbelohde viscometer, conductometric titration, GPC, XRD, SEM and universal materials testing machine were used to monitor the changes in structure, morphology and mechanical performance. Results indicated that the chain scission effect obviously dominated in the radiation degradation of chitosan rod. With the increase of irradiation dose, the amount of CO groups clearly increased, the deacetylation degree (DD), intrinsic viscosity and weight-average molecular weight (M-w) kept decreasing, and the crystallization peak and bending strength reached their maxima at the dose 01 20 kGy. Chitosan rod irradiated at 20 kGy had a relatively higher and more stable bending strength of 132.3 +/- 1.6 MPa. So it was selected as the model to study the lysozyme degradation of irradiated chitosan rod, showing a weaker hydrophilicity than the unirradiated chitosan rod, and almost the same degradation rate.

Bio-resorbable versus metal implants in wrist fractures: a randomised trial	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Fracture; Bio-resorbable; Implant; DASH-scores; Distal radius	DISTAL RADIUS FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; INJURIES; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PLATE; HAND	Background Distal radius fractures are often surgically treated if insufficient reduction has been achieved or after conservative treatment has failed. Treatment using metal implants often demands a secondary operation to remove the implant. A bio-resorbable implant (in this study the Reunite osteosynthesis plate by Biomet Inc) should obviate the need for a secondary operation with equal functional results. Materials and methods Thirty-two patients with a distal radius fracture were assigned to treatment with either a bio-resorbable implant (N = 19) or a metal implant (N = 13). Both groups received the same postoperative care and were followed for 52 weeks in the outpatient clinic. The hypothesis of this study was a decrease in re-operation rate in the experimental group with equal functional results. Results Five out of 19 patients treated with the Reunite plate were re-operated and four out of 13 treated with metal implants needed a secondary operation. In both implants, equal functional results in Range of Motion and DASH scores were found. Conclusions There were no significant differences between the experimental and control group with respect to re-operations, DASH scores and Range of Motion. Because of the higher initial costs and equal results, the use of bio-resorbable implants must be considered carefully.	[van Manen, C. J.; Dekker, M.

Retron nails (Tantum AG, Neumunster, Germany), among others, have been designed to improve medial support of the calcar humeri. The aim of our biomechanical study was to examine whether Retron nails provide increased stiffness for axial loads and adequate stiffness for torsional loads when compared with Philos plates (Synthes AG, Umkirch, Germany). Materials and methods: Twenty-two fresh-frozen paired humeri were collected. After potting the specimens, intact bones were exposed to sinusoidal axial (10-120 N) and torsional (+/- 2.5 Nm) loading for 8 cycles to calculate the initial stiffness and exclude pairs with differences. Afterward, an unstable proximal humeral fracture (AO 11-A3) was created by means of an oscillating saw, and the respective osteosynthesis devices were implanted. After another 4 cycles, initial changes in stiffness were measured. Subsequently, all specimens were tested for 1,000 cycles of loading before final stiffness was assessed. Results: We found no statistically significant differences between Retron and Philos specimens after 4 or 1,000 cycles of loading. Conclusion: Our study suggests that retrograde nailing provides sufficient stability for axial and torsional loading in 2-part fractures of proximal humeri.

A new perspective towards failure of gamma nail systems	EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE			English	Article						trochanteric fractures; internal fixation; gamma nail system; nail failure; titanium fatigue; displaced implant	HIGH-CYCLE FATIGUE; FEMORAL STEMS; FRACTURES; TITANIUM; BEHAVIOR; SCREW	Uncommon causes of nail failures and surgical reinterventions were determined. The study included 23 osteoporotic patients, 13 of whom followed a fast recovery program with early walking (FWB group). The other 10 patients were not allowed full weight bearing until 6 weeks (NFWB group). The T-score was determined before surgery for all cases. A case with a nail breakage after a failed DCS implant fixed in another clinic was also analyzed. The nail was revised and the broken implant underwent a metallurgic and microscopic examination. The average T-score was 2.5 for the patients that followed the fast recovery program and 2.7 for the patients from non-full weight bearing. Four patients, 1 from the NFWB group and 3 from FWB group, presented a screw cut-out. It was found that the errors of the guiding instruments may create dents, scratches or micro-fractures on the titanium coating that lead to an early implant failure. Imperfect reduction leads to incorrect implant placement and a high incidence of failure. Damaging the titanium protective coating, in a low force, high cycles scenario can cause structural failure. Delays in fracture healing and material fatigue are the most common causes of nail failure and can lead to catastrophic complications.

Materials and Methods: Seventy-one patients who underwent fixed-angle locking plate osteosynthesis of a proximal humerus fracture were included. Thirty-three patients underwent device removal at a mean time of 10.4 months after index surgery (removal group). Thirty-eight patients who retained the device after index surgery (retention group) were included in the control group. Visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, and range of motion (ROM) were evaluated pre- and postoperatively. Results: At the final follow-up, mean UCLA score, ASES score, and all ROMs were significantly higher in the removal group compared to the retention group (p < 0.001). However, no significant difference in mean VAS pain score was observed between the two groups. Comparison of the clinical outcomes before and after device removal surgery showed significant improvement in all clinical scores and ROMs after device removal (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Device removal surgery in symptomatic patients following locking plate osteosynthesis of a proximal humerus fracture can result in significant improvement in functional outcomes.

Materials and methods: Medical records; and radiographs of dogs with fractures stabilized with the Fixin system in the period from May 2005 to September 2010 were reviewed. For each patient, data pertaining to signalment, the nature of the fracture, implants used, and evidence of fracture healing were recorded. The outcome and complications were determined from clinical and radiographic follow-up examinations. Limb function was evaluated between 40 days and 90 days postoperatively. Owners of pets with complications were contacted by phone for long-term follow-up. Results: Eighty-two fractures in seventy-five dogs met the inclusion criteria for the study. Radiographic re-examinations were carried out between eight days to two years (median 60 days) following surgery. Seventy-three out of 82 fractures (89%) reached union without complications. Major complications were seen in six dogs (7%). Limb function was graded as 'normal' in 73/75 (97%) dogs and 'mild lameness' in 2/75 (3%) cases. Clinical significance: Despite a modest complication rate, the Fixin locking bone plating system appears to be an acceptable choice of implant for the stabilization of appendicular fractures in dogs.

Gut bacterial assemblages of freshwater macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Gut microbial community; Freshwater insect; Functional feeding groups	NUTRITIONAL CONSTRAINTS; DIGESTIVE ENZYMES; NITROGEN-FIXATION; AMINO-ACIDS; STREAM; INSECTS; DIVERSITY; PLANT; COMMUNITIES; WOOD	Little is known about the impacts of diet and environment on the composition and stability of gut microbial assemblages among freshwater macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups, compared to terrestrial counterparts. In this study, we compared gut microbial assemblages among functional feeding groups and environmental/dietary materials (biofilm and bacterioplankton) within and across two Northeastern Ohio streams differing in environmental conditions, following partial 16S rRNA sequence data analyses. Four functional feeding groups (filter feeders, grazers/collectors, omnivores, and predators) were uncovered in both streams, with significant differences in gut microbial community compositions among functional feeding groups within streams, and significant similarities in gut microbial community compositions between the same functional feeding groups across streams. Observed differences and similarities among functional feeding groups may be attributed to group-specific internal sorting processes due to physical and chemical properties (such as pH and oxygen levels) of the gut, which impact successful bacterial colonization. Results from this study provide insights into the impacts of diet and environment on the composition and stability of freshwater macroinvertebrate gut microbial assemblages. Results also provide a basis for further studies investigating initial establishment and colonization of gut microbiota across developmental stages, and potential gut microbial functions of importance to freshwater macroinvertebrate hosts.

An in vitro experiment was conducted to study the colonization and association of Sb16 and Sb26 diazotrophic strain (previously isolated from rice rhizosphere) on two rice genotypes namely Mayang Segumpal and MR219. Root colonization was observed under scanning and transmission electron microscope. After 5 days of inoculation diazotrophs colonized on the surfaces and internals of lateral roots, root hairs and epidermal cells of the rice roots. Sb16 (Rhizobium sp.) formed aggregated cells and produced mucilaginous materials that may be involved in their attachment oil roots. Rice seedlings inoculated with diazotrophs produced significantly higher biomass compared to control and 35 kg ha(-1) of nitrogen treatments. The diazotrophs association increased rice seedlings root and shoot biomass. Mayang Segumpal rice colonized by Rhizobium sp. (SB16) content higher tissue nitrogen (4.47%) and increased plant biomass by 36% over the non-inoculated control and 22% over 35 kg ha(-1) of N fertilizer. While the MR219 rice inoculated with Corynebacterium sp. contained 4.30% tissue N and increased 32% of plant biomass over non-inoculated control and 21% over 35 kg N ha(-1) The study showed that inoculation with diazotrophic strains (Sb16 & Sb26) improve plant growth including tissue nitrogen content of rice and differences in the association between diazotrophs and rice genotypes.

Tissue engineering technology for such large-scale damaged layered tissue may be developed by using layered scaffold with stem cells. In this study, therefore, a novel multi-layer scaffold consisting of a porous poly (epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) layer for cartilage regeneration and a porous composite layer of poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) and hydroxyapatite (HAp) for bone regeneration was developed. The microstructure of the scaffold was characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). Compression tests were also performed to understand the stress-strain behavior. FE-SEM observation clearly showed that an interlayer exists between the PCL and the composite layers. The compressive stress-strain relation is characterized by a stepwise behavior including the first and the second steps. The first modulus corresponding to the first step is mainly related to the deformation of the PCL layer; on the other hand, the second modulus is related to both solidified PCL layer and the composite layer and increases with increase of HAp content of the composite layer. It is also found that the classical mechanics theory and three-dimensional finite element model can predict the first modulus reasonably well.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment methods applied to patients with midfacial fractures, in a representative group of patients. Material and methods: A 10-year retrospective evaluation and statistical analysis of the observation charts of patients admitted and treated for midfacial fractures in the study's host clinic were performed. Results: The majority of the fractures were zygomatic complex fractures n=242 (43.06%). The most frequent treatment method applied was the orthopedic/closed method n=222 (58.58%), followed by combined orthopedic-surgical treatment n=124 (32.72%). Fourteen patients developed complications (3.69%). Combined treatment resulted in the greatest number of complications n=12 (1.0.000). The most common complication was malunion n=10, which most frequently occurred in the case of patients with Le Fort I, II and III fractures (p=0.000). Conclusions: The two methods: orthopedic/closed and surgical (open reduction with internal fixation) were statistically equally effective for the treatment of midfacial fractures, both having overall good results in terms of evolution or postoperative complications.

J	Lanmüller, H; Wernisch, J; Alesch, F				Lanmueller, Hermann; Wernisch, Johann; Alesch, Francois			Technical analysis of dual channel pulse generators used in deep brain stimulation; a safety evaluation	ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Deep brain stimulation; Pulse generator; Hardware failure; Quality control	SUDDEN FAILURE	A sudden failure of implantable pulse generators (IPG) occurred in 15 out of 143 units during the last 4 years in our patients. This corresponds to a failure rate of 10.5%. In all cases, the connection between the causes of battery and electronic circuit was found defective in the destructive analysis. In order to better understand the failure causes we proceeded to an analysis of explanted IPGs which had reached their normal life span due to depletion of the battery. A functional test and an intensive destructive analysis were carried out in 14 units. The internal parts of the IPG were inspected by light and electron microscopy. Deformations of the connection between battery and electronic circuit could be found in 12 out of 14 IPGs. The epoxy bonds, which achieve the mechanical fixation between the two contact areas of the bond wires, were found separated in 86%. Additionally, in six out of 14 devices the bond wires were either found lifted or with cracks as a sign of material fatigue.

Biological capacitance, defined as the apparent capacitance attributed to biological activity including biofilm production, plays a role in this phenomenon. In this research, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was employed to study anode capacitance and resistance during the start-up period of MFCs so that the role of biological capacitance was revealed in electricity generation by MFCs. It was observed that the anode capacitance ranged from 3.29 to 120 mF which increased by 16.8 % to 18-20 times over 10-12 days. Notably, lowering the temperature and arresting biological activity via fixation by 4 % para formaldehyde resulted in the decrease of biological capacitance by 16.9 and 62.6 %, indicating a negative correlation between anode capacitance and anode resistance of MFCs. Thus, biological capacitance of anode should play an important role in power generation by MFCs. We suggest that MFCs are not only biological reactors and/or electrochemical cells, but also biological capacitors, extending the vision on mechanism exploration of electron transfer, reactor structure design and electrode materials development of MFCs.

Small and Large Titanium Plates Are Equally Effective for Treating Mandible Fractures	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							ANGLE FRACTURES; NONCOMPRESSION MINIPLATE; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; LINE	Purpose: The use of small titanium plates for the management of mandibular fractures continues to be a source of controversy because of their load-sharing properties. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the use of small plates for mandibular fractures is as efficacious as large plates in a large level I trauma center. Materials and Methods: Consecutive subjects presenting with mandibular fractures were randomly allocated to the use of either small plates (group 1) or large plates (group 2). The primary predictor variable was the plate size. The primary outcome variable was fracture union. The secondary outcomes included complications and operative time. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for ordinal and continuous variables and the chi(2) test or Fisher exact test for proportions. Results: A total of 127 consecutive subjects with a fracture of the mandible were enrolled in the study. Of the 127 subjects, 53 completed the required follow-up of at least 6 weeks. There was no difference in the rate of fracture union between the 2 groups (P = .95). Conclusions: The study findings suggest that the use of small plates and monocortical screws for mandibular fractures results in favorable outcomes compared with using larger plates and bicortical screws.

The development of various innovative bone substitutes is also currently on the increase. Materials and methods In our prospective study, we used Ostim (R), a novel resorbable nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite paste, together with Cerabone (R), a solid hydroxyapatite ceramic, in combination with angularly stable osteosynthesis to treat 24 tibia compression fractures. Types B2 and B3, as well as types C2 and C3 fractures, according to the AO classification, were included in the study. Results The mean total range of joint motion in terms of flexion and extension was improved from the immediate postoperative value of 79 +/- 14 degrees to 97 +/- 13 degrees at 6 weeks after surgery, to 109 +/- 16 degrees at 3 months, and finally to 118 +/- 17 degrees at 1 year. In three patients, a delayed wound healing was observed as a local complication. Conclusion The use of the Ostim (R) and Cerabone (R) combination is an effective method in treating tibia compression fractures with large defect zones left after reduction.

Doping kaolinite with atoms of different elements lead to defects in the internal crystal, which change the physical and chemical properties of kaolinite. In this work, we utilized density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore the change in electronic structures of kaolinite before and after the elemental substitution of Al by Ag, Pd, Rh, Tc, Zn, and Zr. Then, the interactions between Cs and pristine or doped kaolinites (001) were systematically investigated by analysing the adsorption energy (E-ads), electron transfer and density of states. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to study the key factors that affect the adsorption energy of kaolinite/Cs. The results show that the distance from Cs atoms to the kaolinite (001) surface and the number of transferred charges after adsorption of Cs atoms are significantly related to the adsorption energy of the system. The results of a Pearson correlation analysis also verified the reliability of this conclusion. All findings in this work are expected to be significant to the development and utilization of clay minerals as host materials for radioactive metal adsorbents.

Material and Methods: In a prospective study, the pull-out-force measurements were performed on 8 female cadaver pelvises, both on the obturator membrane and internal muscle, using the force measurement device PCEFM50 (PCE Instruments). Tested were the hooks of 2 on the market available mini-sling kits (MiniArc by American Medical System; Ajust by BARD Inc.). Connected to the force measurement device, the hooks were placed into the obturator membrane and the obturator internus muscle. Mean value and SD were documented. Results: On the complete obturator complex, Ajust showed a significantly higher pull-outforce (2,561.75 +/- 638.8 g) than did the MiniArc (1,780.69 +/- 442.3 g), p = 0.025. No significant differences were performed on the obturator membrane. Conclusions: The Ajust mini-sling hook is, given the objective results, more stably attached to the obturator complex than the MiniArc. Yet, both systems are sufficiently attachable to the evaluated anatomic structures, fulfilling the needed requirements for their use in the treatment of SUI. (C) 2016 S.

The soft tissue injury and handling of the soft tissue envelope are crucial in pilon fracture outcomes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the early rate of complications using the strategy of "soft tissue control" for operative treatment of complex pilon fractures. Materials and Methods: 36 complex pilon fractures were treated with the "soft tissue control" strategy. Patients followed the standard staged protocol, anterolateral approach to the distal tibia, the "no-touch" technique and incisional negative pressure wound therapy for pilon fractures. Patients were examined clinically at 2-3 weeks and then 8 weeks for complications associated with the surgical technique. Results: All fractures were AO/OTA (Orthopaedic Trauma Association) type C fractures (61% C3, 22% C2 and 16% C1). Only one patient developed superficial infection and resolved with antibiotics and local wound care. None developed deep infection. Conclusions: The strategy of soft tissue control for treatment of pilon fractures resulted in relatively low incidence of early wound complications in patients with complex pilon fractures.

In this study, the moisture absorption behavior of the C-3D/EP composites with different interface conditions was investigated. The role of interface condition was evaluated by comparing weight gain, diffusion parameters, and reductions of mechanical properties of the two 3D composites with different interface conditions, as well as by SEM observation. The weight change and diffusion parameters were determined by immersion tests and the mechanical properties degradation was investigated by examining flexural and shear properties during hygrothermal aging. It was found that moisture absorption behavior and losses of mechanical properties were interface dependent. The composites of higher interface strength showed lower moisture absorption rate (k) and diffusion coefficient (D) values at 37 degrees C and 80 degrees C, and a lower equilibrium moisture content (M-infinity) at 37 degrees C, but a higher M-infinity at 80 degrees C. A mechanism was proposed to elucidate interface dependence of hygrothermal aging. In addition, a comparison to the unidirectional composites was made to assess the influence of fiber structure.

Hooliganism and maxillofacial trauma: The surgeon should be warned	JOURNAL OF STOMATOLOGY ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article						Maxillofacial trauma; Hooliganism; Riot	FOOTBALL; INJURIES	Introduction: With more than 270 million spectators, football - or soccer - is the most popular sport in the world. International football events generate many risky situations, including hooliganism and are an opportunity to analyze the incidence and the particularities of associated trauma. We sought to underline the potential rapid and brutal increase in maxillofacial trauma during a world-class competition. Material and methods: A retrospective multicenter study of the epidemiology of maxillofacial traumas during the UEFA 2016 Cup was conducted. All the medical data from each UEFA 2016 World Cup matches from 10 June 2016 to 10 July 2016 were collected. Only the maxillofacial traumas requiring a surgery under general anesthesia and a hospitalization were included. Results: 11 patients from 3 different cities were included. The main etiology was interpersonal violence (7/11), followed by road accidents (3/11). Open reduction with internal fixation of a mandibular fracture was the most performed surgery (9/11). Patients were 18 to 50 year-old, with an average age of 30.6 years. Discussion: This study underlines the violence of riots between "ultra" supporters during the 2016 UEFA cup. We noticed an upsurge of maxillofacial trauma severe enough to require a surgery under general anesthesia. Hooligan behaviors should be known by every practitioner dealing with trauma care, and may requires transitional adjustment of public health policy. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Postoperative ROM were therefore compared between the EF and the VP, focusing on the movement of the radiocarpal (RC) and midcarpal (MC) joints evident on radiology. The clinical outcomes of the two methods were also evaluated. Material/Methods: Functional radiographs were taken in active volar and dorsal flexions from both the injured and contralateral sides. Clinical outcomes in terms of grip strength, pulp pinch, Quick-DASH, and the modified Cooney evaluation were compared. Results: The average wrist volar flexion angle was significantly smaller on the injured side in both groups, significantly so in the VP group. No significant differences were seen in clinical outcome. Although distinct restriction of the wrist volar flexion angle was seen in patients treated with the VP, the Quick-DASH and the modified Cooney evaluation showed no difference between these two groups. Conclusions: These results should be considered when performing surgical treatment for patients with distal radius fracture. These procedures should be adopted to complement each other according to local conditions and individual patient-related factors.

Methods: The study included 60 patients with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Thirthy patients (mean age: 57.2 +/- 7.4; 16 males and 14 females) underwent arthroscopic double-row repair alone (Group 1), another 30 (mean age: 56.9 +/- 6.0; 15 males and 15 females) had an injection of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) (Group 2). The groups were compared with DASH as a primary outcome score and Constant-Murley score, visual analog scale, measurement of active forward flexion, and external and internal rotation as secondary outcome measures. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess the integrity of the repair at 12 months postoperatively. Results: Primary and secondary outcome measures statistically improved in both groups postoperatively (p<0.05). Overall mean primary and secondary postoperative outcome measures were not significantly different between the 2 groups. A retear was seen in 9 subjects (30%) in Group 1 and 4 subjects (14%) in Group 2 (p<0.05). Conclusion: The local injection of PRP into a primary arthroscopic double-row cuff repair resulted in lower recurrence rates than repairs without the novel biological augmentation material.

How- ever, the release of phosphorus from PBC into solution decreases its adsorption performance and reusability and causes phosphorus pollution of water. In this study, Alcaligenes faecalis (A. faecalis) was loaded on PBC to produce a novel biocomposite (A/PBC). After adsorption equilibrium, phosphorus released into solution from PBC was 2.32 mg/ L, while it decreased to 0.34 mg/L from A/PBC (p < 0.05). The U(VI) removal ratio of A/PBC reached nearly 100%, which is 13.08% higher than that of PBC (p < 0.05), and it decreased only by 1.98% after 5 cycles. When preparing A/ PBC, A. faecalis converted soluble phosphate into insoluble metaphosphate minerals and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). AndA. faecalis cells accumulated through these metabolites and formed biofilm attached to the PBC surface. The adsorption of metal cations on phosphate further contributed to phosphorus fixation in the biofilm. During U(VI) adsorption by A/PBC, A. faecalis synthesize EPS and metaphosphate minerals by using the internal components of PBC, thus increasing the abundance of acidic functional groups and promoting U(VI) adsorption. Hence, A/PBC can be a green and sustainable material for U(VI) removal from wastewater.

Grafting of tibial bone defects in knee replacement using Norian skeletal repair system	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						knee; prosthesis; calcium phosphate cement	CALCIUM-PHOSPHATE CEMENT; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; ARTHROPLASTY; AUGMENTATION; FRACTURES; SRS; PLATEAU	Introduction: The authors have been using Norian skeletal repair system (SRS) to repair cancellous bone defects in knee replacements since 1999. Norian SRS is injectable, biocompatible calcium phosphate cement with a high mechanical strength. This product is similar to the mineral phase of bone and should undergo gradual remodeling with time. We present our experience with this bone substitute in a total of 13 knee replacement surgeries. Materials and methods: This included three unicompartmental knee replacements (UKR), two bilateral UKR following tibial plateau fractures, five revisions of UKR to total knee replacements (TKR), two TKR revisions and one hinged knee prosthesis for significant deformity. Full weight bearing was permitted as soon as tolerated in all patients. Patients were evaluated at the latest follow-up using both the Knee Society Score (KSS) and GIUM (Italian UKR Users Group) knee scores. Results: At the latest follow-up, no poor results were seen with an improvement between pre-operative and post-operative knee scores in all cases. There was no evidence of bone loss or post-operative deformity. Complete compound resorption was seen in the first 4 cases. Conclusions: The authors state that Norian SRS is a practical alternative as bone grafting in knee replacement surgery for type 1 and 2 bone defects.

Base fractures of the fifth proximal phalanx can be treated conservatively with buddy taping and immediate mobilisation	DANISH MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							HAND	INTRODUCTION: Treatment of base fractures in the proximal phalanx depends on the fracture type, the degree of displacement and whether fracture reduction is stable or not. Internal fixation often leads to decreased mobility of the injured finger despite exact reduction of the fracture. Our treatment is focused upon function and to a lesser extent on exact reposition of the fractured fifth digit. Buddy taping was used after initial, closed reduction of the fracture allowing for immediate mobilisation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective follow-up study of 53 consecutive conservatively managed base fractures in 53 patients with a mean age of 39 years. All fractures were treated with buddy taping to the fourth digit and immediate mobilisation. RESULTS: The subjective outcome showed high overall satisfaction, and only four patients reported mild pain at rest or work. Malrotation was noted in three cases, none of which needed corrective surgery. All but one patient regained full flexion of the affected finger. Satisfactory extension was seen as only two patients had a lack of extension in both the metacarpo-phalangeal and the proximal interphalangeal joint. No nonunion or delayed unions occurred. CONCLUSION: In the literature there is no consensus on the treatment of fractures in the base of the proximal phalanx in the fifth digit. We propose conservative management with buddy taping which enables immediate mobilisation of this particular fracture.	[Vadstrup, Lars S.; Jorring, Stig; Bernt, Peter; Boeckstyns, Michel E.

A three-dimensional model of a mandible was created and a 10 mm advancement SSRO was simulated. The model was fixed using a four-hole miniplate, a six-hole miniplate, a newly designed six-hole miniplate and their curved versions. Maximum principal stress values for bone, von Mises stress values for osteosynthesis materials, and the amount of displacement between segments were measured. The highest von Mises value was observed in the curved version of the newly designed six-hole miniplate; the lowest value was detected in the four-hole curved miniplate. The lowest value of maximum principal stress in the bone was found in the curved version of the novel design six-hole miniplate. The least displacements between segments were also recorded in the new design of straight miniplate; therefore, for large mandibular advancement surgery, this novel six-hole miniplate may be a promising option with positive biomechanical characteristics.

The aim of this biomechanical study was to compare the primary stability of one, respectively, two compression wires to intraosseous wiring and tension band wiring for the arthrodesis.Materials and methodsThe stability of the arthrodesis was tested by applying flexion (n=11) and extension (n=10) force with 10 degrees bending. Arthrodesis was achieved by one, respectively, two crossed compression wires and intraosseous wiring. In a control group (n=11) tension band wiring was tested to 10 degrees flexion and extension as well.ResultsMean values for flexion bending for intraosseous wiring were 10.94N, for one compression wire 12.82N, for tension band wiring 17.95N, and for two crossed compression wires 20.42N. Mean values for extension bending were 9.71N for intraosseous wiring, 13.63N for one compression wire, 21.43N for tension band wiring and 22.56N for two crossed compression wires.ConclusionThe primary stability of the compression wires was statistically significant superior to intraosseous wiring. In comparison to tension band wiring which showed an intermediate stability. The application of a compression wire could be considered for further clinical testing in the arthrodesis of interphalangeal joints.

We investigated a novel fluoroscopy-based image guidance system in orthopaedic trauma surgery. Materials and methods: The study was a prospective, not randomised, single-centre case series at a level I trauma centre. A total of 45 patients with 46 injuries (foot 12, shoulder 10, long bones seven, hand and wrist seven, ankle seven and spine and pelvis four) were included. Different surgical procedures were examined following the basic principles of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen/Association for the Study of Internal Fixation (AO/ASIF). Main outcome measurements were the number of trials for implant placement, total surgery time, usability via user questionnaire and system failure rate. Results: In all cases, the trajectory function was used, inserting a total of 56 guided implants. The system failed when used in pelvic and spinal injuries, resulting in a total failure rate of 6.5% (n = 3) of all included cases. The overall usability was rated as good, scoring 84.3%. Conclusion: The novel image-guidance system could be integrated into the surgical workflow and was used successfully in orthopaedic trauma surgery. Expected advantages should be explored in randomised studies. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Materials and methods: 26 patients (29 joints) were diagnosed in period of 5 years (2011-2015) with CHF, 5 patients had concomitant mandibular fracture. Fractures were diagnosed on basis of conventional orthopantomogram (OPG) and computed tomography (CT). Results: Intraoperative arthroscopy revealed hyperemia and hypervascularity in all 29 joints, anterior disc dislocation in 26 joints, cartilage erosion in 21 joints and hemorrhagic clots were present in 10 joints. Major hemarthrosis or tear of the posterior band, as often described in MRI, could not be shown in our patients. Data from the study further the understanding of intraarticular pathology of the TMJ after acute trauma in a group with CHF. Conclusion: Intraoperative arthroscopy is useful for direct evaluation and accurate diagnosis of the extent of soft tissue damage to TMJ in CHF. Larger and more long-term studies including comparison to MRI findings should be helpful to refine the treatment and postoperative management of patients after CHF.

JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							OPEN REDUCTION; MANDIBULAR CONDYLE; INTERNAL-FIXATION; CLOSED TREATMENT; COMPLICATIONS; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; METAANALYSIS; MANAGEMENT	Purpose: This study evaluated the outcomes and complications of the surgical treatment of condylar fractures by the retromandibular transparotid approach. The authors hypothesized that such an approach would be safe and reliable for the treatment of most condylar fractures. Materials and Methods: A retrospective evaluation of patients who underwent surgical reduction of a condylar fracture from January 2012 to December 2014 at the Clinic of Dentistry and Maxillofacial Surgery of the University Hospital of Verona (Verona, Italy) was performed. Inclusion criteria were having undergone surgical treatment of condylar fractures with a retromandibular transparotid approach and the availability of computed tomograms of the preoperative and postoperative facial skeleton with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Static and dynamic occlusal function, temporomandibular joint health status, presence of neurologic impairments, and esthetic outcomes were evaluated in all patients. Results: The sample was composed of 25 patients. Preinjury occlusion and temporomandibular joint health were restored in most patients. Esthetic outcomes were deemed satisfactory by clinicians and patients. Neither permanent neurologic impairments nor major postoperative complications were observed. Conclusions: According to the results of the present study, the retromandibular transparotid approach is a viable and safe approach for the surgical treatment of condylar fractures.

Elastic fibers in the aortic valve spongiosa: A fresh perspective on its structure and role in overall tissue function	ACTA BIOMATERIALIA			English	Article						Elastic fibers; Scanning electron microscopy; Immunohistochemistry; Aortic valve; Material behavior	BIAXIAL MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; INTERNAL SHEAR PROPERTIES; GLUTARALDEHYDE FIXATION; CARDIAC VALVES; MICROSTRUCTURE; CUSP; REPLACEMENT; EXPRESSION; COMPONENTS; XENOGRAFT	This study characterizes the elastic fiber structure within the aortic valve spongiosa, the middle layer of the tri-laminate leaflet. The layer is rich in glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans, through which it resists compression and lubricates shear between the outer layers. Elastin in this layer forms a fine, interweaving structure, yet it is unclear how this particular structure, which uses elasticity to preload the leaflet, assists spongiosa function. In this study, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are used to characterize spongiosa elastin, as well as investigate regional differences in structure. IHC for elastin highlights an intermediate structure which varies in thickness and density between regions In particular, the spongiosa elastin is thicker in the hinge and coaptation region than in the belly. SEM of NaOH-digested leaflets shows a rectilinear pattern of elastic fibers in the hinge and coaptation region, as opposed to a radially oriented stripe pattern in the belly. In conclusion, elastic fibers in the spongiosa connect the two outer layers and vary regionally in structure, while possibly playing a role in responding to regionally specific loading patterns.

The fluoroscopic extents of the femoral head can change with the slightest change in the limb position which includes internal and external rotations, adduction and abduction. These changes can affect the visible TAD and articular-clearance of the screw-tip. The purpose of this Computed-tomography(CT) based analysis is to analyze the variations of the radiographically visible articular-clearance and TAD measurements with limb positioning and to determine the appropriate fluoroscopic projections for different screw-positions within the femoral head. Material and methods: We retrospectively analysed CT studies of twenty healthy proximal femora. Spatial markers simulating screw tips were placed in the different combinations of anteroposterior(AP) and cephalocaudal(CC) positions. Software-based AP and lateral radiographs were developed for each screw position. Additional AP radiographs with femur in internal and external rotation, and lateral radiographs with the femur in adduction and abduction were developed. The variation of TAD and articular-clearance of the screw was measured among these radiographs for individual screw tip positions. Results: Screw tip placed centrally in AP and CC planes position didn't show any significant variation in TAD and articular-clearance with modified AP and lateral radiographs. Significant differences were observed in TAD and articular-clearance values for other screw tip positions. Anteriorly placed screw tips had higher TAD and articular-clearance values with external rotation and similar changes were observed with posteriorly placed tips in internal rotation. Inferiorly placed tips had higher articular-clearance and TAD with limb abduction and similar changes were observed for superiorly placed tips with limb adduction. Conclusions: For the sliding screws placed in non-central locations, the clearance of the screw tip from the articular margins can not be appropriately estimated with conventional AP and lateral views. Additional views with the limb in internal rotation and external rotation in AP view, and adduction-abduction in lateral view are required to safely place the sliding screw in the femoral head. The limb should be brought to a neutral alignment for the accurate estimation of TAD. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, some of the investigated metallic implants suffer from stress-shielding, palpability, biocompatibility, etc. Consequently, the biodegradable scaffolds fabricated from polymers have gathered much attention from researchers and thus helped the tissue engineering sector by providing many alternative materials whose functionality is similar to that of natural bones. Herein, we present the fabrication and testing of a novel composite, magnesium (Mg)-doped hydroxyapatite (HAp) glazed onto polylactic acid (PLA) scaffolds where polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) used as a binder. For the composite formation, Creality Ender-3 pro High Precision 3D Printer with Shape tool 3D Technology on an FSD machine operated by Catia design software was employed. The composite has been characterized for the crystallinity (XRD), surface functionality (FTIR), morphology (FESEM), biocompatibility (hemolytic and protein absorption), and mechanical properties (stress-strain and maximum compressive strength). The powder XRD analysis confirmed the semicrystalline nature and intact structure of HAp even after doping with Mg, while FTIR studies for the successful formation of Mg-HAp/PVA@PLA composite. The FESEM provided analysis indicated for the 3D porous architecture and well-defined morphology to efficiently transport the nutrients, and the biocompatibility studies are supporting that the composite for blood compatible with the surface being suitable enough for the protein absorption. Finally, the composite's antibacterial activity (against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) and the test of mechanical properties supported for the enhanced inhibition of active growth of microorganisms and maximum compressive strength, respectively. Based on the research outcomes of biocompatibility, antibacterial activity, and mechanical resistance, the fabricated Mg-HAp/PVA@PLA composite suits well as a promising biomaterial platform for orthopedic applications by functioning towards the open reduction internal fixation of bone fractures and internal repairs.

METHODS: Eighteen adult male New Zealand white rabbits were anesthetized and a segmental full thickness bone defect of 10 mm in length was created in the middle of the right radial shaft in all rabbits. They were divided into two groups of 9 rabbits. Group I was considered as control and the fractured site was fixed using finger bone plate with 4 screws, whereas the cancellous bone scaffold coated with Nano-Hydroxyapatite was used to fill the gap after fracture fixation in Group II. Radiography, two dimensional and color Doppler ultrasonography were done before and after creating defects and on 0, 15, 30, 60 and 90 days to evaluate local reaction as far as new blood vessels network and callus formation are observed. RESULTS: On the radiographs during the whole process, bone repair in Group I was not as perfect as those in Group II samples and trace of internal callus filled the gap incompletely in 60 days in Group I, whereas in Group II internal callus almost was formed on 30 days and in addition intercortical callus was seen supporting to cover and filled the gap completely in this group in 60 day; Sonographic findings confirmed the protrusion of newly formed blood vascular network in 30 days in Group I and from 15 days in Group II and remarkably increased till end of observation period. CONCLUSIONS: The nano-hydroxyapatite with more features and shorter in time, made possible the reconstruction of bone tissue and alternative techniques as well as previous bone graft, also radiography and ultrasonography are reliable techniques to trace local reaction at proper time.

Shoulder evaluation with isokinetic strength testing after arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs	JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY			English	Article						Rotator cuff; rotator cuff tear; rotator cuff repair; Constant score	FOLLOW-UP; SURGICAL REPAIR; SINGLE-ROW; TEARS; INTEGRITY	Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to evaluate, with isokinetic testing, the recovery of strength in patients with rotator cuff tears treated with two different arthroscopic repair techniques. Materials and methods: From September 2004 to September 2006, patients with a full-thickness supraspinatus tear were randomized to two different groups. Patients in group 1 underwent side-to-side repair with permanent sutures, whereas those in group 2 underwent tendon-to-bone fixation with 1 metal suture anchor loaded with double sutures. The same independent examiner evaluated the outcomes using the Constant score and isokinetic strength testing preoperatively and at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Data analysis was also performed in three subgroups: small, medium, and large tears. Results: Constant scores improved from preoperatively to 12 months postoperatively. In group 1, the mean Constant score was 32 points before surgery and 78 points at 12 months postoperatively. In group 2, the mean Constant score was 30 points before surgery and 88 points at 12 months after surgery. Strength increased gradually during the first postoperative year. In group 1, preoperative mean peak torque was 34% and 39% in internal rotation and external rotation, respectively. After repair, it decreased to 17% and 21%, respectively, at 12 months. In group 2, preoperative mean peak torque was 32% and 37% in internal rotation and external rotation, respectively; after surgery, it decreased to 9% and 12%, respectively, at 12 months. Data analysis showed that the difference in improvement in Constant scores and in strength recovery from preoperatively to postoperatively in groups I and 2 was statistically significant (p < .05). Conclusion: We showed a strength difference between patients with side-to-side repairs and those with tendon-to-bone repairs. Level of evidence: Level 1; Prospective randomized study.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of a modified application of the proximal humeral internal locking system (PHILOS) plate in extra-articular distal-third diaphyseal humeral fractures. Materials and methods: A total of 23 patients with extra-articular distal humerus fractures were treated using either open plating or the minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) technique with upside down application of the PHILOS plate. Fracture configuration, number of screws in the distal fragment, and time to union were analysed. Elbow range of motion, Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS), and complications were evaluated at the final follow-up. Results: Fracture union was obtained in all patients at a mean postoperative time of 20.8 +/- 2.9 weeks. The mean shortest and longest cortical lengths were 50.7 +/- 14.0 mm and 85.2 +/- 12.4 mm, respectively. The average number of screws in the distal humeral fragment was 5.6 +/- 0.7. No statistically significant correlation was observed between the shortest cortical length and number of screws in the distal fragment (p = 0.224) or between the longest cortical length and the number of screws in the distal humeral fragment (p = 0.956). The average MEPS was 97.6 (range, 75-100). No postoperative complications that required reoperation were occured. Conclusion: A modified anterior application of the PHILOS plate in extra-articular distal-third diaphyseal humeral fracture showed satisfactory outcomes, so it is an alternative when considering the ability to increase plate-screw density with locking screw fixation in a distal humeral fragment.

This study aimed to identify prognostic factors for a successful surgical outcome. Materials and Methods: We included all orbital fractures treated by ORIF referred to the Ophthalmology clinic for assessment over a 12-year period. A successful outcome was defined as (i) a single operation, (ii) improved diplopia and globe position at 6 months, (iii) no surgical complications, and (iv) patient satisfaction. Data was collected on presenting symptoms, orthoptic measurements, time interval from injury to surgery, fracture geometry and involvement of internal, and external bony landmarks. Univariate and multivariate regression was used to identify predictive factors for success. Results: There were 143 cases with median age 35.4 years and 81.8% (117/143) male. 51% (73/143) were complex fractures involving multiple orbital walls. 63.6% (91/143) achieved significant improvement in both enophthalmos and diplopia at 6 months. 15.3% (22/143) had significant preoperative soft tissue or neurogenic injury. 11.8% (17/143) required orbital plate repositioning or removal. 1.4% (2/143) developed orbital haematoma and 4.2% (6/143) had cicatricial entropion. Pre-operative nerve or muscle damage (OR 0.05, p = 0.01) and infraorbital fissure fracture (OR 0.38, p = 0.04) were associated with poor outcomes, whereas an intact posterior ledge was associated with successful outcomes (OR 3.03, p = 0.02). Conclusion: Careful ocular motility evaluation to ascertain neurogenic injury and muscle compartment syndrome, and radiological analysis of the integrity of the posterior ledge and the inferior orbital fissure can facilitate management and expectations of ORIF surgery.

Functional improvement is sustained following anatomical and reverse shoulder arthroplasty for fracture sequelae: a registry-based analysis	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Shoulder; Arthroplasty; Shoulder replacement; Proximal humerus fracture; Post-traumatic sequelae	PROXIMAL HUMERUS FRACTURES; MANAGEMENT; MALUNION; MOTION; RANGE; HEMIARTHROPLASTY; FIXATION; RECOVERY; OUTCOMES; DESIGN	Introduction: Shoulder arthroplasty for proximal humerus fracture sequelae is known to provide significant patient improvement, yet this outcome varies with time, prosthesis type, and fracture sequelae. We outline the expected course of postoperative shoulder pain and function in patients with anatomical (ASA) or reverse (RSA) shoulder arthroplasty following different fracture sequelae. Materials and methods: Of 111 consecutive patients from our local shoulder arthroplasty registry, 32 underwent ASA for Boileau type 1 sequelae and 77 RSA patients were identified with Boileau types I, III, and IV. By 5 year post-surgery, there were 72 patients available. All patients underwent standardised ASA or RSA procedures with anatomical (Promos Standard; Lima SMR (TM); Arthrex Eclipse (TM); Univers (TM) II) or reverse prostheses (Promos Reverse (R); Lima SMR (TM) Reverse; Univers Revers (TM); Aequalis (R) Reversed). Range of motion, Constant-Murley, Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), and Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) scores were compared at 6, 12, 24, and 60 months postoperatively. We used generalised linear mixed models or random-effects ordered logistic regression to investigate postoperative changes of outcome parameters from baseline to follow-up time points for each group as well as for group comparisons. Results: Range of motion and clinical scores improved until 24 months postoperatively and did not deteriorate thereafter, except for internal rotation of Boileau type III and IV patients and external rotation of RSA patients with type I and IV sequelae. At all follow-ups, ASA patients with Boileau type I sequelae had significantly better internal and external rotation versus patients with RSA and/or other Boileau types (p < 0.001), while Constant, DASH, and SPADI scores were not significantly different between groups. Conclusion: In humeral fracture sequelae, ASA and RSA lead to sustained clinical improvements. Surgeons may primarily consider implantation of ASA in type I sequelae.

The fast developing three-dimensional printing (3DP) technology has provided a new method for making personalized craniomaxillofacial bone plates. However, the properties of these bone plates remain unknown. This study evaluates the mechanical, fatigue, and morphological properties of these bone plates, which may provide data supporting future clinical applications.Materials and methods: The 3DP bone plate was fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM) and electron beam melting (EBM) technologies. Mechanical, surface, and defect analyses were performed to compare their properties with a standard machined sample. One-way analysis of variance was applied, with p < 0.05 considered significant.Results: The 3DP craniomaxillofacial bone plate had better bending strength than that of the standard machined plate (p < 0.01). Whereas the fatigue resistance of the 3DP bone plate needs to be improved in the future. Surface analysis indicated greater roughness of the 3DP bone plate (p < 0.01). However, the surface roughness could be significantly reduced by polishing the surface, which would meet the needs of clinical application after polishing. Further defect analysis revealed the internal defect inside the plate, which should be avoided to improve the mechanical strength of the printed sample in the future.Conclusion: The 3DP titanium craniomaxillofacial bone plate has good mechanical performance and surface morphology, meeting the requirements of clinical application. However, poorer fatigue resistance and a high number of internal defects should be modified in the future.(c) 2021 Association for Dental Sciences of the Republic of China.

The axial and rotational stability of conventional interlocking nails depends primarily on locking screws. This method uses increased operating time and increased radiation exposure. An intramedullary implant that can minimize these disadvantages is obviously better. Expandable intramedullary nail does not rely on interlocking screws and achieves axial and rotational stability on hydraulic expansion of the nail. We analyzed 32 simple fractures of shaft of femur and tibia treated by self-locking expandable nail. Materials and Methods: Intramedullary fixation was done by using self-locking, expandable nail in 32 patients of closed diaphyseal fractures of tibia (n = 10) and femur (n = 22). The various modes of injury were road traffic accidents (n = 21), fall from height (n = 8), simple fall (n = 2), and pathological fracture (n = 1). Among femoral diaphyseal fractures 16 were males and six females, average age being 33 yrs (range, 18- 62 yrs). Seventeen patients had AO type A (A1 (n = 3), A2 (n = 4), A3 (n = 10)) and 5 patients had AO type B (B1 (n = 2), B2 (n = 2), B3 (n = 1)) fractures. Eight patients having tibial diaphyseal fractures were males and two were females; average age was 29.2 (range, 18- 55 yrs). Seven were AO type A (A1 (n = 2), A2 (n = 3), A3 (n = 2)) and three were AO type B (B1 (n = 1), B2 (n = 1), and B3 (n = 1)). We performed closed (n = 27) or open reduction (n = 5) and internal fixation with expandable nail to stabilize these fractures. The total radiation exposure during surgery was less as no locking screws were required. Early mobilisation and weight-bearing was started depending on fracture personality and evidences of healing. Absence of localised tenderness and pain on walking was considered clinical criteria for union, radiographic criteria of union being continuity in at least in three cortices in both AP and lateral views. Patients were followed for at least one year. Results : The average operative time was 90 min (range, 55-125 min) for femoral fractures and 53 min (range, 25-115 min) for tibial fractures. Radiation exposure was minimum, average being 84 seconds (range, 54-132) for femoral fractures and 54 seconds (range, 36-78) for tibial fractures. All fractures healed, but few had complications, such as infection (one case with tibial fracture) bent femoral nail with malunion (n = 1), and delayed union (n = 3; 2 cases in femur and 1 case in tibia). Mean time of union was 5.1 months (range, 4-10 months) for femoral fractures and 4.8 months (range, 3-9 months) for tibial fractures. Conclusion : We found the nail very easy to use with effective fixation in AO type A and B fractures in our setting. Less surgical time is required with minimum complications. The main advantage of the expandable nail is that if affords. satisfactory axial, rotatory, and bending stability with decreased radiation exposure to operating staff and the patient.

P.			Helical Plating Compared with Straight Plating and Nailing for Treatment of Proximal Third Humeral Shaft Fractures-A Biomechanical Study	MEDICINA-LITHUANIA			English	Article						unstable humeral fracture; helical plating; humerus; MIPO; biomechanics	INTRAMEDULLARY NAIL; FIXATION	Background and Objectives: The surgical treatment of proximal humeral shaft fractures usually considers application of either long straight plates or intramedullary nails. By being able to spare the rotator cuff and avoid the radial nerve distally, the implementation of helical plates might overcome the downsides of common fixation methods. The aims of the current study were (1) to explore the biomechanical competence of different plate designs and (2) to compare their performance versus the alternative treatment option of using intramedullary nails. Materials and Methods: Twenty-four artificial humeri were assigned to the following four groups for simulation of an unstable proximal humeral shaft fracture and instrumentation: Group 1 (Straight-PHILOS), Group 2 (MULTILOC-Nail), Group 3 (45 degrees-Helical-PHILOS), and Group 4 (90 degrees-Helical-PHILOS). All specimens underwent non-destructive, quasi-static biomechanical testing under loading in axial compression, torsion in internal/external rotation, and pure bending in four directions, accompanied by motion tracking. Results: Axial stiffness/displacement in Group 2 was significantly higher/smaller than in all other groups (p <= 0.010). Torsional displacement in Group 2 was significantly bigger than in all other groups (p <= 0.017). Significantly smaller coronal plane displacement was identified in Group 2 versus all other groups (p < 0.001) and in Group 4 versus Group 1 (p = 0.022). Significantly bigger sagittal plane displacement was detected in Group 4 versus all other groups (p <= 0.024) and in Group 1 versus Group 2 (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Intramedullary nails demonstrated higher axial stiffness and smaller axial interfragmentary movements compared with all investigated plate designs. However, they were associated with bigger torsional movements at the fracture site. Although 90 degrees-helical plates revealed bigger interfragmentary movements in the sagittal plane, they demonstrated improved resistance against displacements in the coronal plane when compared with straight lateral plates. In addition, 45 degrees-helical plates manifested similar biomechanical competence to straight plates and may be considered a valid alternative to the latter from a biomechanical standpoint.

G.; Di, Wu; Yang, Rufei; Zhao, Tianyuan; Yang, Maowei			Effect of tourniquet application on postoperative outcomes in sinus tarsi approach for intra-articular calcaneus fractures	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Estimated blood loss; Intra-articular calcaneal fractures; Sinus tarsi approach; Surgical visualization; Tourniquet	INTERNAL-FIXATION; ANKLE ARTHROSCOPY; COMPLICATIONS; SURGERY	Introduction Tourniquets are commonly used during foot and ankle surgery to provide a bloodless operative field and increase surgical comfort, despite the potential risks associated with it. This study compared postoperative outcomes of tourniquet-assisted and non-tourniquet-assisted operative fixation of calcaneal fractures via the sinus tarsi approach. Materials and methods A retrospective study from March 2015 to December 2018 revealed 131 patients with closed calcaneal fractures who underwent minimally invasive surgery at our hospital. Visualization, operating time, blood loss, and postoperative pain were collected. Patients in the tourniquet group (n = 62) were compared with patients in the non-tourniquet group (n = 69). Results The visibility of the surgical field was fair/poor in 2 cases in the tourniquet group and fair/poor in 19 cases in the non-tourniquet group (P < 0.05). The mean operative time was 64.7 +/- 3.5 min in the tourniquet group and 76.0 +/- 6.1 min in the non-tourniquet group (P < 0.05). The estimated intraoperative and postoperative blood loss was 56.6 +/- 33.3 and 100.0 +/- 25.3 mL, respectively, in the tourniquet group and 205.0 +/- 31.6 and 38.3 +/- 19.8 mL, respectively, in the non-tourniquet group (P < 0.05). The VAS pain scores 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h postoperatively were 4.3 +/- 1.8, 3.1 +/- 1.2, and 2.0 +/- 0.5 points, respectively, in the tourniquet group and 2.1 +/- 1.1, 1.6 +/- 1.0, and 1.0 +/- 0.3 points, respectively, in the non-tourniquet group (P < 0.05). Conclusion Tourniquet application during the sinus tarsi approach for calcaneal fractures can significantly improve surgical visualization and reduce intraoperative blood loss. However, adverse events associated with the use of tourniquets include increased postoperative pain and bleeding. Due to increased postoperative bleeding and pain, more attention should be given to the postoperative phase in patients treated with tourniquets.	[Zaid, Hamood H.

J	Thonse, R; Conway, J				Thonse, Raghuram; Conway, Janet			Antibiotic cement-coated interlocking nail for the treatment of infected nonunions and segmental bone defects	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC TRAUMA			English	Article						antibiotics; cement; infection; nonunion; intramedullary nail	TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY; ELUTION CHARACTERISTICS; PROPHYLACTIC USE; OPEN FRACTURES; OSTEOMYELITIS; BEADS; GENTAMICIN; RELEASE; THERAPY; TIBIA	Chronic infection of bone with nonunion and/or bone defects is traditionally treated by a 2-stage procedure involving initial debridement and antibiotic delivery and then definitive internal fixation. Alternatively, external fixators are used to provide stability. A technique with which antibiotic cement-coated interlocking intramedullary nails are prepared in the operating room with the use of nails and materials that generally are available is herein described. Although useful for all infected nonunions and/or segmental bone defects, this technique is particularly useful for patients who are not ideal candidates for external fixation and for those who do not want to have an external fixator applied. This technique was used in a series of 20 patients. In 17 patients, the goal of bony union was achieved (85%). In the remaining 3 patients (15%), the goal of control of infection was achieved with stable nonunion (1 patient) and stable nonunion with cement spacer (2 patients). In 95% of the patients (19 of 20 patients) control of infection was achieved except for in 1 patient, who had a bony union with intermittent wound discharge and subsequently underwent an above-the-knee amputation. Three patients (15%) needed exchange nailing to another antibiotic cement-coated nail (for continued infection) before complete control of infection could be achieved. Four patients (20%) experienced cementnail debonding during removal of the antibiotic cement-coated nail (3 during exchange to an uncoated intramedullary nail, 1 during removal at the request of patient). One patient experienced partial debonding at insertion, coinciding with the site of segmental defect, which was treated with an antibiotic cement spacer. In summary, control of infection and stability to promote union has traditionally been provided by 2 separate procedures, which have proved to be efficacious in the past. However, both these goals can be achieved in half the patients with 1 surgical procedure in a variety of scenarios using the technique of an antibiotic cement-coated intramedullary nail.

Using porcine and rat models the efficacy of locally delivered IGF-I and TGF-beta1 from an implant coating has been demonstrated. A thin and biomechanical stable biodegradable poly(D,L-lactide) was used to coat implants and serve as a drug carrier. Due to reports of possible foreign body reactions caused by polymer materials in orthopedic surgery, this study investigated the biocompatibility of the polylactide implant coating and the locally released growth factors during the time course of rat tibial fracture healing (days 5, 10, 15, and 28 after fracture). Monocytes/macrophages and osteoclast were detected using an monoclonal antibody against ED1 (comparable to CD68 in mice and human). The antibody ED I stains monocytes, macrophages and osteoclast in the bone marrow and in the newly formed fracture callus. A moderate density of the monocytes/macrophages was seen in the proximal part of the medullary canal, but almost no cells were detectable in the region distal to the fracture. The amount of stained cells increased during the observation time with a maximum at days 10 and 15 followed by a decrease at day 28. No differences were detectable between the investigated groups from day 5 to 15 post fracture indicating, that the used poly(D,L-lactide) or the incorporated growth factors do not evoke an elevated immunological response compared to the uncoated titanium implant at the investigated time points. A significantly higher amount of ED I positive cells was measured 28 days after fracture in the control group compared to the groups with the coated implants. In conclusion, no indication of a foreign body reaction due to the use of the polylactide or the growth factors was found indicating a good short-term biocompatibility of this bioactive coating.

Existing treatment options varies from osteotomy (with or without graft) to osteosynthesis using various implants and grafting techniques (muscle pedicle, vascularized, and nonvascularized fibula). The aim of this study was to assess outcome of nonvascularized fibular strut graft and cancellous screw fixation in neglected femoral neck fractures in the younger age group. Materials and Methods: Medical records of 32 patients of neglected femoral neck fracture, in the age group of 22-45 years (mean 37.8 years), operated between May 1994 to December 2001, were retrospectively reviewed. After the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 28 patients having three years minimum follow-up (mean 4.6 years) were included. Delay between injury and operation varied from four weeks to 42 weeks (mean 16.4 weeks). Closed reduction was achieved in 17 patients; open reduction through Watson-Jones anterolateral approach was performed in the remaining 15 patients in whom closed reduction failed. The fracture was transfixed with three parallel guide wires. Appropriate sized cannulated lag screw (7 mm) was then inserted in two of the wires. Selection of the third guide wire for fibula depended on the space available in both anteroposterior and lateral view. Results: Satisfactory bony union was obtained in 25 patients, of whom in four cases, the union occurred in 10-20 (mean 15) of varus. Nonunion occurred in three patients (9.37), and aseptic necrosis occurred in another six patients (18.75). Of the 25 patients where union was achieved, five patients showed excellent results; 14 good and six had poor functional result, as evaluated using modified Anglen criteria. Conclusion: Nonvascularized fibular strut graft along with cancellous screws provides a dependable and technically less-demanding alternative procedure for neglected femoral neck fractures in young adults. Fibula being cortical provides mechanical strength besides stimulating the union and getting incorporated as biological graft.	[Azam, Md Quamar; Iraqi, A. A.; Sherwani, M. K.

For this purpose, we verified whether the biomechanics are different according to the position of the screw while using the same number of screws. In addition, we tried to verify whether the insertion of additional inferomedial screws would make a difference in stability. Materials and methods Twenty-four proximal humerus bones were included in the study. A two-part fracture was created and fixed using a locking plate. Cyclic loading and load-to-failure test were applied to three groups: group A (proximal 6 screws + calcar screws), group B (proximal 6 screws), and group C (proximal 4 screws + calcar screws). Interfragmentary gaps were measured following cyclic loading and compared. The failure was defined when the bone breakage or medial gap closing was observed during ultimate failure load applied. The load-to-failure, maximum displacement, stiffness, and yield load were recorded and compared. Results The interfragmentary gap was differently reduced by 0.29 +/- 0.14 mm, 0.73 +/- 0.25 mm, and 0.53 +/- 0.09 mm following 1000 cyclic loading for groups A, B, and C, respectively. The load-to-failure was 945.22 +/- 101.02 N, 941.40 +/- 148.90 N, and 940.58 +/- 91.78 N in groups A, B, and C, respectively. The stiffness of group A (214.76 +/- 34.0 N/mm) was superior when compared to that of group C (171.12 +/- 23.0 N/mm;p = 0.025). The maximum displacement prior to failure, yield load, showed no significant difference between comparative groups. Conclusion Our study did not show any additional biomechanical effects with the use of inferomedial supporting screws in non-osteoporotic proximal humerus fracture, besides making the fracture-plate construct stiff. The role of the inferomedial supporting screw was also unclear. However, the groups that used increased screw fixation and inferomedial screw insertion seemed to be more resistant to cyclic loading.

Material and methods: The study was performed on 12 young patients with avulsion fracture of the anterior tibial spine. All 12 patients had type 3 Modified Meyers and McKeever fractures. The injury mechanism was direct anterior to posterior trauma in full leg length hyperextension with sport trauma reported in all cases. The physical examination revealed decreased range of motion, extension deficit, and pain during walking. Radiology, MRI, and CT pathologic findings described complete fracture of the anterior tibial spine with no clear signs of callus formation at the time of examination. All patients underwent arthroscopic suture surgical treatment. The Tegner, the Lysholm, and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores were used to evaluate subjective outcomes at three and six months after the surgery. Radiographs were used to assess callus formation and healing status of the fracture. Results: The mean IKDC score was 33.4 +/- 23.3 (p = 0.032) preoperatively and 84.2 +/- 14.3 at final follow-up (p = 0.0032, CI = 95%). The mean Tegner score improved from 3.8 +/- 1.1 pre-operatively to 6.7 +/- 2.2 at six months follow-up (p = 0.0231, CI = 95%). The Lysholm score differed significantly at baseline compared to final follow-up (53.7 +/- 17.3 vs. 87.7 +/- 9.9; p = 0.0066, CI = 95%). In all cases (n = 12), the radiographs taken after six months revealed the healing of the fracture in the anatomic position without secondary displacement. No functional knee instability was detected at the end of the study. Conclusions: The study provides preliminary promising results regarding fracture healing, knee stability, and functional subjective scores. Patient selection was a major factor of success prediction for this technique.

J	Bo, XF; Wang, WD; Chen, Z; Liu, ZC				Bo, Xuefeng; Wang, Weida; Chen, Zan; Liu, Zhicheng			Compression-distraction reduction surgical verification and optimization to treat the basilar invagination and atlantoaxial dislocation: a finite element analysis	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE			English	Article						Basilar invagination; Atlantoaxial dislocation; Compression-distraction reduction technique; Surgical optimization		Background: Basilar invagination (BI) combined with atlantoaxial dislocation (AAD) leads to foramen magnum stenosis and medullary spinal cord compression, causing nerve dysfunction. The purpose of the surgery is to remove the bony compression at brainstem ventral side and fix the unstable spinal segment and make it fused stably. Occipital cervical internal fixation system that simultaneously reduces atlantoaxial horizontal and vertical dislocation are established. We propose here a new compression-distraction reduction (CDR) technique. We aimed to construct a congenital BI-AAD preoperative finite element model (FEM) to simulate the CDR technique for AAD reduction surgery. Methods: Based on computed tomographic scans of patients' cervical vertebrae, a three-dimensional (3D) geometric model of the cervical spine (C0-C4) of congenital BIAAD patients was established using Mimics13.1, Geomagic2012, and Space Claim14.0 softwares. The mechanical parameters of the tissues were assigned according to their material characteristics using ANSYS Workbench 14.0 software. A 3D FEM was established using the tetrahedral mesh method. The bending moment was loaded on C0. Physiological conditions-anteflexion, retroflexion, left and right flexion, left and right rotation-were simulated for preoperative verification. The occipital cervical fixation system FEM was established. The CDR technique was simulated to perform AAD reduction surgery. Data were obtained when the atlantoaxial horizontal and vertical dislocation reductions were verified postoperatively. Stress data for the two surgical schemes were analyzed, as was the reduction surgery optimization scheme for congenital BI-AAD patients with abnormal lateral atlantoaxial articulation ossification. Results: Cervical spine (C0-C4) FEM of congenital BI-AAD patients was established. The CDR technique was simulated for AAD reduction. We obtained the mechanical data when the atlantoaxial horizontal and vertical dislocation reductions were satisfied for the two surgical schemes. Conclusions: The CDR technique for AAD reduction was feasible and effective. We propose this reduction optimization scheme for patients with lateral atlantoaxial articulation due to abnormal ossification of congenital BI-AAD. We also provide a biomechanically theoretical basis for improving the reliability of pure posterior reduction surgery and simplifying surgery for complicated BI-AAD disease.

We prepared three-dimensional (3D) printed biphasic cal-cium phosphate (BCP) scaffolds composited with nano-graphene oxide (GO). The biological effects of the GO/BCP composite scaffolds could induce the differentiation of rat bone marrow stem cells (BM-SCs) and the migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) for bone repair. The proper ratio of GO in the composite scaffold regulated the composites' surface roughness and hydrophilicity to a suitable range for the adhesion and proliferation of BMSCs and HUVECs. Besides, the GO/BCP composite scaffold increased osteogenesis and angiogenesis by activating BMP-2, RUNX-2, Smad1/4, and VEGF. The customized intramedullary nail combined with GO/BCP scaffold was applied to repair CSBD (2.0 cm in length) in a beagle femur model. This fixation strategy was confirmed by finite element analysis. In vivo, the results indicated that the custom-made internal fixation provided sufficient stability in the early stage, ensuring bone healing in a considerable mechanical environment. At 9 months postoperatively, longitudi-nal bony union and blood vessels in osteon were observed in the CSBD area with partial degradation in the 0.3% GO/BCP group. In the three-point bending test, the ultimate load of 0.3% GO/BCP group reached over 50% of the normal femur at 9 months after repair.

We prepared the biological vascular scaffolds through cell extraction and fixing the porcine thoracic arteries with 1% (by w/v) genipin solution for 3 days, and then examined their mechanical properties and microstructures; glutaraldehyde- and epoxy-fixed counterparts were used as controls. HUVECs were seeded on the type I collagen-coated surface of different modified acellular vascular tissues (fixed with different crosslinking agents), and the growths of HUVECs on the specimens were demonstrated by means of MTT test, the secretion of PGI(2) and vWF by HUVECs on the various specimens was also measured. Finally, HUVECs were seeded on the luminal surface of acellular biological vascular scaffolds (< 6 mm internal diameter) which were, respectively, treated in the same manner described above, and then cultured for 9 days. On the ninth day, the HUVECs on the luminal surface of these vascular scaffolds were examined morphologically and by immunohistochemistry. Genipin-fixation can markedly diminish antigenicity of the vascular tissues through partially getting rid of cell or reducing the level of free amino groups in the vascular tissues. Genipin-fixed acellular vascular tissues mimicked the natural vessels due to the maintenance of the integrity of total structure and the large preservation of the microstructures of collagen fibers and elastic fibers; therefore, it appeared suitable to fabricate vascular scaffolds in mechanical properties. Compared to controls, the genipin-fixed acellular vascular tissues were characterized by low cytotoxicity and good cytocompatibility. The HUVECs can not only proliferate well on the genipin-fixed acellular vascular tissues, but also preserve the activities and function of endothelial cells, and easily make it endothelialized in vitro. The results showed that the genipin-fixed acellular porcine vascular scaffolds should be promising materials for fabricating vascular grafts or the scaffolds of tissue-engineered blood vessels.

Material and methods: Out of 100 prospectively and consecutively treated patients, 52 patients manifested dentofacial deformities requiring bimaxillary orthognathic surgery with maxillary antero-superior repositioning combined with mandibular set back and so were included. All patients were managed with rigid internal fixation (RIF) and without intermaxillary fixation (IMF). Preoperative cephalograms were analyzed and treatment plans and prediction tracings produced by computerized surgical interactive simulation. The planned horizontal and vertical hard tissue positional changes were transferred to model surgery on a three-dimensional articulator system (SAM) and finally to surgery. Five to six weeks after surgery, the actually obtained hard and soft tissue profile changes were cephalometricly assessed. Results: The mean accuracy of the planned and predicted hard and soft tissue outcome was relatively high varying from 0.0 mm to 0.5 mm from one cephalometric reference point to another. At the cephalometric reference points where significant differences between planned/predicted, and actually obtained hard and soft tissue positional changes were demonstrated, these significant inaccuracies were, except for the predicted horizontal position of the lower lip, relatively small, varying from 0.2 mm to 1.1 mm. However, the variability of the predicted hard and soft tissue individual outcome was relatively high. Conclusion: The current study demonstrates from a mean point of view relatively high predictability of the immediate postsurgical hard and soft tissue outcome. However, as the variability of the predicted individual outcome seems to be relatively high, caution should be taken when presenting the planned and predicted hard and soft tissue positional changes to the individual patient, preoperatively.

Treatment of pediatric forearm midshaft fractures: Is there a difference between types of orthopedic surgeon?	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Children; Forearm midshaft fractures; Surgical management; Titanium elastic nails; Functional outcome	SHAFT FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; CHILDREN; COMPLICATIONS	Purpose of the study: The objective of this study was to compare the clinical and radiological outcomes of pediatric forearm midshaft fractures treated operatively with titanium elastic nails (TENs) by pediatric orthopedists and non-pediatric orthopedists. Material and methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 88 children of forearm midshaft fractures, who were randomized to operative stabilization either by pediatric orthopedists (Group A, 44 cases) or by non-pediatric orthopedists (Group B, 44 cases) from April 2013 to February 2014. At baseline, the groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, AO classification, injured side and interval from injury to surgery. We collected data on operative and radiation time, open reduction rate, length of hospitalization, bone union time, return to full physical activity time, complications, and measured clinical results using the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Forearm Fracture Fixation Outcome Classification. Results: The mean follow-up period was 15.8 + 3.3 months for Group A and 15.2 + 4.2 months for Group B (P=0.491). No significant difference existed in time to union (P= 0.282), the overall complication rate (P = 0.750), return to activity time (P= 0.408), and clinical outcomes according to CHOP classification (P= 0.908) between the two groups. However, the mean operating time and radiation time was significantly longer in Group B than in Group A (P=0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). In addition, there was a trend for patients of Group B to have a higher rate of open reduction (P = 0.035). Discussions: Our results indicated that children forearm midshaft fractures treated surgically by pediatric orthopedists offered potential advantages including a shorter operating time and radiation time, a lower rate of open reduction. However, both pediatric and non-pediatric orthopedists had achieved satisfactory clinical results in treatment of these injuries. Level of evidence: Level II prospective randomized study.

FACTORS PREDICTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF EARLY OSTEOARTHRITIS FOLLOWING LATERAL TIBIAL PLATEAU FRACTURES: MID-TERM CLINICAL AND RADIOGRAPHIC OUTCOMES OF 73 OPERATIVELY TREATED PATIENTS	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article						Tibial plateau; fracture; lateral condyle; internal fixation; clinical outcome; radiographic outcome	KNEE LIGAMENT INSTABILITIES; CALCIUM-PHOSPHATE CEMENT; TEGNER ACTIVITY SCALE; DEGENERATIVE ARTHRITIS; CONDYLAR FRACTURES; WOMAC OSTEOARTHRITIS; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; LYSHOLM KNEE; BONE-GRAFT; RESPONSIVENESS	Background and Aims: The indications for operative treatment of lateral tibial plateau fractures are still controversial. The objective of this study was to determine whether residual articular surface depression and valgus malalignment of plated lateral tibial plateau fractures at medium-term follow-up affect the clinical and radiographic outcomes. Material and Methods: A chart review of patients with operatively treated (AO type B3.1) tibial plateau fractures that were admitted to our level I trauma center between 2002 and 2008 was performed. Out of 123 patients, 73 were available to participate in a clinical and radiographic follow-up examination. The mean follow-up time was 54 months. Patients were clinically assessed and completed the Lysholm knee score and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. Maximal articular surface depression, radiological mechanical axis, and degree of posttraumatic osteoarthritis were evaluated from standing radiographs. Results: Patients with valgus malalignment of 5 degrees or greater at follow-up developed more advanced osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 3-4) than patients with a normal mechanical axis (p = 0.006). Similarly, patients with articular depression greater than 2 mm at follow-up also developed more advanced osteoarthritis compared to patients with a depression of 2 mm or less (p = 0.001). The degree of valgus malalignment or articular depression had no effect on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index or Lysholm scores. Conclusions: The postoperative articular congruity and normal mechanical axis of the lower leg after plate fixation in lateral tibial plateau fractures seem to have a role in prevention of posttraumatic osteoarthritis but does not appear to predict clinical outcome at medium-term follow-up. The role of initial dislocation and associated cartilage damage in the development of osteoarthritis following these fractures is still unknown.

In plate osteosynthesis, flexion forces affect the implant and can determine its breakdown and osteosynthesis failure. The wave plate seeks to solve the problem by transferring the support to the cortex under the plate or creating the resistance of a leaf spring. Objectives: To evaluate the bone healing pattern of femoral pseudoarthrosis treated with wave plate and its effectiveness in consolidation. Materials and methods: We retrospectively evaluated 18 patients with femoral pseudoarthrosis treated with wave plate. Results: Three months after surgery, one patient presented healing of pseudoarthrosis, six months after surgery, 16 patients presented healing of pseudoarthrosis and at 12 months, all patients had complete bone healing. Regarding the type of pseudoarthrosis, nine patients had avascular and nine vascular pseudoarthrosis. Fifteen patients had medial cortical failure and three, lateral cortical failure. In all cases, consolidation started where there was bone failure, be it medial or lateral. Discussion: The wave plate technique is well indicated for the existence of cortical bone failure, both in fractures and in pseudoarthrosis. Objective is to stabilize the fragments by transferring and allowing contact between them. The formation of the bone callus occurred in our sample from the region of the bone defect to the region of bone contact, using either a tricortical or cancellous bone graft. The elastic force of the wave and the eccentric distribution of loads in the femur favored the formation of a callus where it was distracted (bone failure) and the location with concentration of movement (proximity between the fragments) was the end of bone healing. Conclusion: The wave plate technique was effective in bone healing of femoral pseudoarthrosis, promoting consolidation from the cortical failure to the bone contact zone. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Computed tomography versus plain radiography assessment of acetabular fracture reduction is more predictive for native hip survivorship	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Acetabular fracture; Hip survivorship; Total hip arthroplasty; Pelvic radiography; Computed tomography; Postoperative reduction	OPERATIVE TREATMENT; INTERNAL-FIXATION; POSTOPERATIVE CT; POSTERIOR WALL	Introduction Computed tomography (CT) is more accurate than plain pelvic radiography (PXR) for evaluating acetabular fracture reduction. As yet unknown is whether CT-based assessment is more predictive for clinical outcome. We determined the independent association between reduction quality according to both methods and native hip survivorship following acetabular fracture fixation. Materials and methods Retrospectively, 220 acetabular fracture patients were reviewed. Reductions on PXR were graded as adequate or inadequate (0-1 mm or > 1 mm displacement) (Matta's criteria). For CT-based assessment, adequate reductions were defined as < 1 mm step and < 5 mm gap, and inadequate reductions as >= 1 mm step and/or >= 5 mm gap displacement. Predictive values and Kaplan-Meier hip survivorship curves were compared and risk factors for conversion to total hip arthroplasty (THA) were identified. Results Mean follow-up was 8.9 years (SD 5.6, range 0.5-23.3 years), and 52 patients converted to THA (24%). Adequate reductions according to CT versus PXR assessment were associated with higher predictive values for native hip survivorship (92% vs. 82%; p = 0.043). Inadequate reductions were equally predictive for conversion to THA (33% for CT and 30% for PXR; p = 0.623). For both methods, survivorship curves of adequate versus inadequate reductions were significantly different (p = 0.030 for PXR, p < 0.001 for CT). Only age >= 50 years (p < 0.001) and inadequate reductions as assessed on CT (p = 0.038) were found to be independent risk factors for conversion to THA. Reduction quality as assessed on PXR was not found to be independently predictive for this outcome (p = 0.585). Conclusion Native hip survivorship is better predicted based on postoperative CT imaging as compared to PXR assessment. Predicting need for THA in patients with inadequate reductions based on both assessment methods remains challenging. While both PXR and CT-based methods are associated with hip survivorship, only an inadequate reduction according to CT assessment was an independent risk factor for conversion to THA.

Materials and methods Forty-two patients with lateral plateau fractures (Schatzker types II and III) treated by AR/IF were included retrospectively. Radiographic evaluations using the Rasmussen system and computerized tomography (CT) were performed. Clinical evaluations were also conducted at final follow-up. Second-look arthroscopy was applied during metal removal. Results All fractures were healed after 46.3 months of follow-up. The mean Tegner activity level was not decreased significantly, going from 7.1 +/- 2.1 pre-injury to 6.6 +/- 2.3 at final follow-up (p = 0.301). However, the amount of depression noted on CT imaging was significantly decreased from 8.9 mm +/- 4.4 to 1.2 mm +/- 1.3 (p = 0.000). The mean Rasmussen radiologic score at final follow-up was 14.5 +/- 5.3 points. Osteoarthritis was progressed in six patients (14.3%). Twenty-five patients had concomitant LM tear, with 18 cases treated by repair and the remaining ones treated by partial meniscectomy. Preoperative joint depression (> 11 mm) was significantly associated with the risk of LM tear (p = 0.024; odds ratio (OR): 9.0, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.018-79.545) and most of those lesions could be repaired (p = 0.001). Postoperatively, 16 repaired patients were evaluated by second-look arthroscopy; 15 had healed completely and one had healed partially. Conclusion LM tears are frequently combined with lateral tibial plateau fracture, especially in correlation with more than 11 mm of joint depression, though most of those lesions can be repaired at the time of fracture fixation.

And the plate used to fix the acetabular fracture has always been positioned at the pelvic brim after reduction through the Stoppa approach. However, there are few studies depicting the clinical significance of the psoas minor. The purpose of this paper was to explore the relationship between the insertion of the psoas minor tendon at the pelvic brim (IPMTPB) and screw placement through the Stoppa approach. Materials and methods: Fifteen cadavers were dissected for adequate exposure to IPMTPB in our study. However, not all specimens had a psoas minor. For the specimens with IPMTPB, the posterior and anterior edges were used as the first and second entry points, dividing the area from the sacroiliac joint to the pubic symphysis into three zones (d1, d2 and d3). The average proportion of each zone was obtained after measurement the three zones, to locate the two entry points for the specimens without a psoas minor. From the longitudinal Stoppa incision, the first wire was inserted horizontally, and the second wire was placed vertical to the bone surface. Fluoroscopy and computed tomography (CT) were conducted to examine the relationship between the wires and the acetabulum. Results: There was a psoas minor in sixteen hemipelvises (53.33%). After measurement and calculation, we determined that the average proportions of zones d1, d2, and d3 were 28.03%, 29.14%, and 42.83%, respectively. For all specimens, the wires were successfully inserted, and the trajectories of the wires were outside the hip joint cavity. Conclusions: IPMTPB could be used as an anatomic landmark of safe zones for screw placement through the Stoppa approach. For cases without a psoas minor, the zones for extra-articular screw placement could be determined through the measurements in this paper. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Materials and Methods: In total, 309 individuals (143 males and 166 females) who underwent surgery for IFF using a PFN between January 2018 and January 2021 were included in the study. Our surgical team conducted osteosynthesis using the A-PFN (R) (TST, Istanbul, Turkey) nail, the PROFIN(R) (TST, Istanbul, Turkey), and the Trigen InterTAN (Smith & Nephew, Memphis, TN, USA) nail. The PFNs were compared based on age, gender, body mass index (BMI), length of stay (LOS) in intensive care, whether to be admitted to intensive care, mortality in the first year, amount of transfusion, preoperative time to surgery, hospitalisation time, duration of surgery and fluoroscopy, fracture type and reduction quality, complication ratio, and clinical and radiological outcomes. The patients' function was measured with the Harris Hip Score (HHS) and the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Results: Pain in the hip and thigh is the most common complication, followed by the V-effect. The Z-effect was seen in 5.7% of PROFIN patients. A-PFN was shown to have longer surgical and fluoroscopy durations, lower HHS values, and much lower Katz ADL Index values compared to the other two PFNs. The V-effect occurrence was significantly higher in the A-PFN group (36.7%) than in the InterTAN group. The V-effect was seen in 33.1% of 31A2-type fractures but in none of the 31A3-type fractures. Conclusions: InterTAN nails are the best choice for IFFs because they have high clinical scores after surgery, there is no chance of Z-effect, and the rate of V-effect is low.

TSPFD is a fracture-dislocation that severely disrupts the anatomical structure of the carpal bones and may occur as a result of a high energy trauma of the wrist or a fall on an open hand. In this study, the aim is to provide midterm clinical and radiological evaluations of cases diagnosed and treated as TSPFD. Materials and methods: Eleven patients diagnosed with TSPFD as a result of wrist trauma were treated surgically and were analysed retrospectively. Clinical and radiological follow-up of the cases was evaluated. The mean age of the patients was 34 years. All patients were males with a dorsal dislocation according to Herzberg's perilunate fracture-dislocation classification. The mean follow-up time was 33 months. All of the cases were evaluated with preoperative and postoperative standard wrist anteroposterior and lateral radiographs. A dorsal approach was used in all cases. However, in 1 case a volar approach was also required. The Green and O'Brien evaluation scale modified by Cooney was used for the clinical assessment of pain, wrist range of motion, grip strength, and functional status as excellent, good, moderate, or poor. The wrist range of motion was evaluated goniometrically at the final check-up, and a mid-grade disability was observed compared with the uninjured side. A visual analogue scale was used to evaluate the pain. Results: Sufficient union was obtained in all cases with open reduction and internal fixation of the fractures. Grip strength was up to 77.5% of the other side. According to the modified Green and O'Brien clinical evaluation scale, 6 cases were evaluated as good, 3 cases were fair, and 2 cases were poor. No median nerve damage was determined preoperatively or postoperatively and there was no postoperative pin tract infection in any of the patients. Conclusion: This kind of injury represents complex biomechanical damage of the wrist anatomy. If it is diagnosed early and treated with open reduction and stable fixation, a functionally adequate and anatomically integrated wrist can be achieved.

Objectives: To investigate the clinical feasibility and outcomes from direct lateral interbody fusion (DLIF) using autogenous bone grafts and percutaneous posterior instrumentation (PPI) for infectious spondylitis. Summary of Background Data: As one of the minimally invasive techniques, PPI has been attempted for various degenerative lumbar spine disorders combined with anterior lumbar interbody fusion or transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. PPI has been played more roles recently as an internal fixation method for infectious spondylitis. However, the clinical outcomes of DLIF using an autogenous bone graft combined with PPI for infectious spondylitis have been rarely reported. Materials and Methods: Sixteen patients (mean age, 60.3 +/- 18.8 y) who suffered from pyogenic spondylitis underwent single-stage DLIF using an autogenous iliac bone graft combined with PPI. Clinical and radiologic outcomes were evaluated by visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and eradication of primary disease. Radiologic outcomes were evaluated by changes of affected segmental lordosis and fusion status. Results: Bony fusion and eradication of primary disease were obtained in all patient except 1 case during the follow-up (mean, 31.3 +/- 13.1 mo; range 14-46 mo). Preoperative VAS (7 +/- 1.2) and ODI (61.3 +/- 5.4) scores improved significantly at the last follow-up (VAS, 3.4 +/- 1.5; ODI, 32.3 +/- 15.4). C-reactive protein normalized at postoperative 20.1 +/- 0.7 days (range, 15-28 d). Although height and lordosis in the affected segment were restored by surgery, all patients showed loss of the restored lordosis and height at the final follow-up. Loss of the restored lordosis and height were related to subsidence of the grafted bone. Conclusions: Minimally invasive PPI followed by debridement and DLIF was a feasible surgical alternative in our consecutive 16 cases of pyogenic spondylitis. In most cases, however the subsidence of anteriorly grafted fusion was inevitable despite successful fusion and eradication of the primary lesion.

Between 2010 and 2011, the 2nd generation PEEKPower HTO-Plate(A (R)) was used for medial owHTO in 28 consecutive patients (19 men, 9 women; mean age +/- A SD: 45 +/- A 11 years; mean varus deviation +/- A SD: 4A degrees A A +/- A 2A degrees). All of the patients had an osteotomy gap height of a parts per thousand currency sign12 mm without bone grafting. Visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, WOMAC score, and Lysholm score were evaluated preoperatively and at 12 and 24 months postoperatively. Sports-related outcomes included the Tegner scale, and a self-designed questionnaire preoperatively and 24 months postoperatively. Fixation stability of the implant was evaluated radiographically in two planes by comparing the medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) and tibial slope 2 days after medial owHTO (baseline measurements) and after implant removal (follow-up measurements). Complications were recorded during the whole study period. Compared to preoperative conditions, VAS, WOMAC, and Lysholm scores improved significantly (p < 0.05) at the 12- and 24-month follow-up. No significant differences were found between the 12- and 24-month follow-up. After 24 months, the sports frequency increased significantly (p < 0.05). No significant differences between baseline and follow-up measurements for the MPTA and tibial slope were observed. Total complication rate was 4 %, with one patient developing non-union. In the clinical practice, the 2nd generation PEEKPower HTO-Plate(A (R)) is a safe and efficient implant for medial owHTO without bone grafting in patients with an osteotomy gap of a parts per thousand currency sign12 mm.

Almost all of these are high energy open injuries. There is no fixed protocol that is followed in the earlier studies. The injury pattern is grotesque and ill managed with poor functional outcome. We report the functional outcome in our series of patients who sustained sideswipe injuries. Materials and Methods: Thirty four patients presenting with sideswipe injuries around the elbow were managed and functional results evaluated. The patients were followed for 15-94 months (mean 74 months). 32 of these were males and two were females. The injuries were sustained between 8 years and 48 years age group (mean 30 years). The right side was affected in 20 and left side was injured in 14 patients. Road traffic accident was the cause in all patients. Principles of management followed were (1) debridement and stabilization of fractures, (2) vascular repair, (3) redebridement, (4) nerve repair and (5) soft tissue cover. An external fixator was used for fracture stabilization in 20 patients with open fractures. Internal fixation was used as a stabilization modality in 12 patients. Primary nerve repair was carried out in 4 cases. In case of segmental loss, tendon transfers or nerve grafting was carried out at a later date once softtissue healing was complete. Soft tissue coverage was provided within 24-48 h of injury. Results were evaluated using the Mayo elbow performance score. Results: The average Mayo elbow performance score was 70. Excellent results (score > 90) in accordance with Mayo elbow score were seen in 30% of the patients. Good results (score 75-89) were seen in 33% of the patients. Conclusion: Sideswipe injuries should be managed timely, aggressively and an algorithmic protocol should be followed to achieve best results. The injury pattern is distinct for which a multispecialty approach is needed and an orthopedic, vascular and plastic surgeon must be involved. Limb salvage is possible in most cases.

Salvage of cephalomedullary nail cutout with the variable angle proximal femoral plate *	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Femoral fracture; Fracture fixation; Intramedullary; Complications; Prostheses and implants; "Cut-out"	TOTAL HIP-ARTHROPLASTY; INTERNAL-FIXATION; INTERTROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; TROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; FAILURE; COMPLICATIONS; SUBLUXATION; DISLOCATION; PREDICTORS; NECK	Introduction: Excellent results have been published in the treatment of the trochanteric fractures in the elderly with cephalomedullary nails or compression hip screws but not free of complications. The perforation of the lag screw through the superior cortex of femoral neck or head followed by rotation and varus collapse of the head-neck fragment, also known as cut-out, is one of them. Probably total hip arthroplasty is the most common solution, but there is no systematic technique for treatment. The objective of this study is to evaluate the results obtained in the treatment of this complication using a variable angle femoral plate. Material and methods: This retrospective study concerns patients over 65 years with peritrochanteric fractures treated with cephalomedullary nail with cut-out failure solved by re-osteosyntesis with variable angle femoral plate between 1st January 20 0 0 and 31 st December 2017. The series includes 29 patients, 26 women and 3 men with average age 87,3. Patients were followed up clinically and radiologically at regular intervals until fracture consolidation at least 9 months. Results: No patients died at the first 9 months after surgery. Fracture mean consolidation has occurred in all patients in 14th weeks (6-20). Operative time was 93,2 minutes (62-129) including removal of nail. No intraoperative complications were observed. Five patients experienced medical complications and two had a superficial wound infection. The mean tip-apex distance (TAD) was 5mm (2-7mm). The neck-shaft angle was 127 degrees. The mean valgization achieved was 32 degrees (15-40). Only one patient needed a second revision surgery due to aseptic hip joint subluxation after 8 weeks of the surgery solved with total hip arthroplasty. Conclusions: The use of variable angle femoral plate in the cut-out treatment is an attractive option which allows the valgization of the fracture to virtually physiological limits and the placement of the cephalic screw in the most sutiable position with good outcomes and few complications.

The aim of this study was to analyze trends and characteristics of maxillofacial fractures sustained during sports activity to develop more effective treatments and possibly to prevent injury. Materials and methodsData of 248 patients with maxillofacial fractures sustained during sports activity were retrospectively analyzed based on their clinical records and radiographs. ResultsThe patients were 226 males (91.1%) and 22 females (8.9%). Their ages ranged from 6 to 70years and the majority were in their second decade. The fractures were sustained in various sports which included baseball in 85 patients (34.3%), rugby in 40 (16.1%), soccer in 30 (12.1%), softball in 22 (8.9%), golf in 10 (4.0%), hockey in 8 (3.2%), combat sports in 28 (11.3%), and others in 29 (11.7%). The cause of injuries was collision with another player in 97 patients (39.1%), hit by a ball in 89 (35.9%), intended attack in 20 (8.1%), hit by equipment of another player in 15 (6.0%), a fall in 14 (5.6%), and collision with ground equipment in 13 (5.2%). The site of fractures was the mandible in 145 patients (58.5%), midface in 100 (40.3%), and both in 3 (1.2%). Among 210 fracture sites in the mandible, 77 (36.6%) were in the angle, 68 (32.4%) in the symphysis, and 65 (30.9%) in others. Among 103 fractures in the midface, 58 (56.3%) were in the zygoma, 26 (25.2%) in alveolar bone, and 19 (18.4%) in others. Treatment was observation in 67 patients (27.0%), maxillomandibular fixation in 64 (25.8%), open reduction and internal fixation in 63 (25.4%), intramaxillary splinting in 40 (16.1%), transcutaneous reduction in 10 (4.0%), and other procedures in 4 (1.6%). ConclusionMaxillofacial fractures sustained during sports activity showed characteristic features dependent on the type of sport and cause of injury.

A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS OF ANTEBRACHIUM TEN-NAILING IN 35 CHILDREN	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article						Pediatric; adolescent; antebrachium; fracture; operative treatment; internal fixation; TEN-nailing; complication	PEDIATRIC FOREARM FRACTURES; INTRAMEDULLARY FIXATION; REMOVAL; BONES; SHAFT; ESIN	Background: Unstable antebrachium diaphyseal fractures in children are nowadays increasingly treated operatively by elastic intramedullary nailing. Aim: Aim of the study was to critically assess both radiological and functional outcome of antebrachium fractures treated by titanium elastic nail (TEN) in a pediatric cohort. Material and Methods: This retrospective study investigated 75 consecutive children, who were treated for antebrachium shaft fractures at Tampere University Hospital during the time period from January 2001 to December 2005. All the fractures were classified according to OTA. Thirty-five children (mean age 12.3 years) were treated by TEN-nailing. Twenty four of the forearm fractures were instable, five were open, five were re-fractures and one had ulnar nerve deficit. In all but one patient both forearm bones were fractured. Twelve (34%) operations were managed by closed reduction, open reduction was needed in 23 (66%) patients. In 29 cases both bones were fixed with TEN-nail. In the four patients with re-fracture in both ulna and radius only the radius was TEN-nailed. In one case radius was fixed with TEN-nail and ulna with K-wire and in another case radius was fixed with TEN-nail and ulna with plate. Fracture pattern, mode of reduction, surgical approach, short- and long-term complications and outcome were recorded. Results: Twenty three (66%) patients achieved healing of the fractures without any limitation in range of motion. Twelve patients with postoperative complication were followed up 31-74 (median of 54) months. Eleven (31%) patients had minor postoperative complications and one (0,3%) patient had a Volkmann's ischemic contracture. Five of complicated patients had more than one problem. Immediate post-operative problems were noted in these five patients. At follow-up visits four patients complained of ulnar nail discomfort, two had neural symptoms. Additionally, three children suffered from re-fractures. Discussion: Despite various minor complications, TEN-nailing is considered suitable treatment for unstable forearm shaft fractures. Most of the problems were related to poor technical performance in nailing.

This study compares monoaxial head locking screws (PHILOSA (c) by Synthes) and a new generation of polyaxial locking screws (NCB-LEA (c) by Zimmer) with respect to biomechanical stability. On nine pairs of randomised formalin fixed humerus specimens, standardised osteotomies and osteosyntheses with nine monoaxial (group A) und nine polyaxial (group B) plate/screw systems were performed. A material testing machine by Instron (M-10 14961-DE) was used for cyclic stress tests and crash tests until defined breakup criteria as endpoints were reached. After axial cyclic stress 200 times at 90 N, plastic deformation was 1.02 mm in group A and 1.25 mm in group B. After the next cycle using 180 N the additional deformation averaged 0.23 mm in group A and 0.39 mm in group B. The deformation using 450 N was 0.72 mm in group A compared to 0.92 mm in group B. The final full power test resulted in a deformation average of 0.49 mm in group A and 0.63 mm in group B after 2,000 cycles using 450 N. When reaching the breakup criteria the plastic deformation of the NCB plate was 9.04 mm on average. The PHILOS plate was similarly deformed by 9.00 mm. As a result of the crash test, in group A the screws pulled out of the humeral head four times whereas the shaft broke one time and another time the implant was ripped out. The gap was closed four times. In group B, there were three cases of screw cut-through, four shaft fractures/screw avulsions from the shaft and two cases of gap closure. The two systems resist the cyclic duration tests and the increasing force tests in a similar manner. The considerable clinical benefits of the polyaxial system are enhanced by equal biomechanical performance.

Material and methods We retrospectively investigated patients who received marker-less SBRT for locally untreated HCC tumors between July 2005 and December 2018. Radiotherapy planning CT was performed under fixation with vacuum cushions and abdominal compression. The clinical target volume (CTV) was equivalent to the gross tumor volume (GTV). The internal target volume (ITV) margin to CTV was determined from calculations based on the motion of the diaphragm. The planning target volume (PTV) margin to ITV was 5-6 mm. In the set-up, radiotherapy planning CT and linac-integrated cone-beam CT performed in the same imaging and fixation settings were merged by referring to the anatomical components surrounding target tumors. The primary endpoint was the 3-year cumulative local tumor progression rate. The upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the 3-year cumulative local tumor progression rate was less than 7.0%, which was interpreted as favorable local control and feasible for marker-less SBRT. Local tumor progression was assessed by mRECIST. Results We reviewed 180 patients treated with 35-40 Gy/5 fractions. The median follow-up time for the local tumor progression of censored tumors was 32.3 months (range, 0.3-104). The 3-year cumulative local tumor progression rate was 3.0% (95% CI, 1.1-6.5%). The 3-year overall survival rate was 71.6% (95% CI, 63.5-78.2%). Regarding acute hematologic toxicities, grade 3 hypoalbuminemia and thrombocytopenia were detected in 1 (0.6%) and 5 (2.9%) patients, respectively. Treatment-related death from SBRT was not observed. SBRT was initiated within 7 days after radiotherapy planning CT for 84% (152/180) of patients. Conclusions Marker-less SBRT for HCC achieved favorable local control that fulfilled the threshold. This result suggests that marker-less SBRT with appropriate settings is a feasible treatment strategy.

Materials and methods: The study included patients above the age of 75 who were diagnosed with intertrochanteric femur fracture and admitted to the Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Ege University Hospital between October 2006 and December 2012. After informed consent was obtained from the patients, they were randomised via sealed opaque envelops into two groups. Patients in Group 1 were internally fixated utilizing proximal femoral nail, whilst the patients in Group 2 were treated with a cemented hemiarthroplasty. Complications were recorded and functional results were evaluated using the Harris Hip score. The mean time of follow up was 31.72 months (min. 18-max. 47, std. dev. +/- 10.68). Results: A total of 54 patients were included in the study. 21 of them (38.9%) received a proximal femoral nail whilst 33 (61.1%) were treated with hemiarthroplasty. Average age of the patients was 82.24 (min. 75-max. 97). Average age in Group 1 was 79.57 (min. 75-max. 91), whilst it was 83.94 in Group 2 (min. 75-max. 97). Harris Hip score analysis revealed that the difference between the patients treated with hemiarthroplasty and proximal femoral nailing was statistically significant in favour of the hemiarthroplasty group within the first 3 months. However, this difference diminished at the 6th month time point, and even reversed as of the 12th month postoperatively. Discussion and conclusions: Although cases with hemiarthroplasty achieved a better level of activity in the beginning, cases with proximal femoral nailing reached a comparable level of activity within a short period of time, faster than those treated with hemiarthroplasty, displaying a better level of activity in the end.

Elastic Stable Chest Repair as a Means of Stabilizing the Anterior Chest Wall in Recurrent Pectus <i>Excavatum</i> with Sternocostal Pseudarthrosis: An Innovative Fixation Device	THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGEON			English	Article						recurrent pectus excavatum; sternocostal pseudarthrosis; elastic stable chest repair (ESCR); Matrix Rib low-profile titanium plate; pectus excavatum	MODIFIED NUSS PROCEDURE; FUNNEL CHEST; DEFORMITIES; EXPERIENCE	Introduction Open surgical procedures in the treatment of pectus excavatum (PE) involve predetermined incisions in the parasternal cartilage and the bony ribs. For some procedures, the ribs are even dissected from the sternum for better sternal mobilization and thus better elevation of the funnel. Secure restoration of the sternocostal junction is then required, with the consequence that healing may be quite impaired. Patients may also subsequently suffer from sternocostal nonunion, for example, pseudarthrosis, and dislocated ribs, as well as pain and a recurrence of PE. Materials and Methods Patients underwent another open surgery with revision of the pseudarthrotic sternocostal junctions and sufficient mobilization of the anterior chest wall, followed by an open reduction and internal fixation using Matrix Rib titanium plates (Synthes, Oberdorf, Switzerland). This procedure consisted of elevating the anterior chest wall and fixing the ribs to the sternum. In 2011 and 2012, we studied this procedure, known as elastic stable chest repair (ESCR), in a series of 20 patients. The patients underwent clinical and ultrasound examinations and X-ray radiographs after the operation, after 6 weeks, and at 3- and 12-month intervals. Results Follow-up showed high patient tolerance, although a loose plate was observed in one patient and a broken plate in three patients. A stable union was achieved for all sternocostal pseudarthroses. PE improved highly significantly (p < 0.001), as the Haller index decreased from 3.6 (range: 2.7-6.6, standard deviation [SD]: 0.92) to 2.7 (range: 2.0-3.7, SD: 0.42). Pain in the anterior chest wall was significantly reduced after the operation in the majority of cases. All but one patient was mobilized already the day after the operation. Conclusions ESCR in recurrent PE achieved functional stabilization of the anterior chest wall combined with satisfactory results.

A comprehensive study by Palvanen et al. demonstrated an increase in the annual fracture rate of 13.7% per year over the past 33 years. Should this trend continue, the fracture rate would triple over the next three decades. The increasing incidence of low-energy fractures raises questions about the optimal treatment in terms of functional outcome, pain, and rehabilitation time, as well as the economical impact. Despite the high incidence and costs of proximal humerus fractures, there is currently no valid scientific evidence for the best treatment method. Several publications, including a Cochrane review outline the need for high-quality, well-designed randomized controlled trials. Methods/Design: The study is a prospective, randomized, national multi-center trial. The hypothesis of the trial is that surgical treatment of displaced proximal humerus fractures achieves better functional outcome, pain relief, and patient satisfaction compared to conservative treatment. The trial is designed to compare conservative and surgical treatment of proximal humerus fractures in patients 60 years and older. The trial includes two strata. Stratum I compares surgical treatment with locking plates to conservative treatment for two-part fractures. Stratum II compares multi-fragmented fractures, including three-and four-part fractures. The aim of Stratum II is to compare conservative treatment, surgical treatment with the Philos locking plate, and hemiarthroplasty with an Epoca prosthesis. The primary outcome measure will be the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score and the secondary outcome measures will be the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) value, OSS, Constant-Murley Score, VAS, and 15D. Recruiting time will be 3 years. The results will be analyzed after the 2-year follow-up period. Discussion: This publication presents a prospective, randomized, national multi-center trial. It gives details of patient flow, randomization, aftercare and also ways of analysis of the material and ways to present and publish the results.

The hypotheses were that the type of hexagonal connection would generate different microstrains and the type of copings would produce similar microstrains after prosthetic screws had been tightened onto microunit abutments. Materials and methods: Three dental implants with external (EH) and internal (IH) hexagonal configuration were inserted into two polyurethane blocks. Microunit abutments were screwed onto their respective implant groups, applying a torque of 20 Ncm. Machined Co-Cr copings (M) and plastic prosthetic copings (P) were screwed onto the abutments, which received standard wax patterns. The wax patterns were cast in Co-Cr alloy (n=5), forming four groups: G1) EH/M; G2) EH/P; G3) IH/M and G4) IH/P. Four SGs were bonded onto the surface of the block tangentially to the implants, SG 1 mesially to implant 1, SG 2 and SG 3 mesially and distally to implant 2, respectively, and SG 4 distally to implant 3. The superstructure's occlusal screws were tightened onto microunit abutments with 10 Ncm torque using a manual torque driver. The magnitude of microstrain on each SG was recorded in units of microstrain (mu epsilon). The data were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and Tukey's test (p<0.05). Results: Microstrain values of each group were: G1=338.1 +/- 223.0 mu epsilon; G2=363.9 +/- 190.9 mu epsilon; G3=415.1 +/- 53.5 mu epsilon; G4=363.9 +/- 190.9 mu epsilon. No statistically difference was found between EH and IH, regardless of the type of copings (p>0.05). The hypotheses were partially accepted. Conclusions: It was concluded that the type of hexagonal connection and coping presented similar mechanical behavior under tightening conditions.

Allen, II			Randomized prospective evaluation of the use of tranexamic acid and effects on blood loss for proximal humeral fracture surgery	JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY			English	Article						Tranexamic acid; proximal humeral fracture; reverse shoulder arthroplasty; open reduction-internal fixation; blood loss; TXA; RSA; ORIF	TOTAL HIP; ARTHROPLASTY; TRIAL	Background: Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an antifibrinolytic agent that has been used to reduce blood loss in orthopedic surgery. It has been shown to decrease blood loss in upper- and lower-extremity arthroplasty, as well as lower-extremity fracture surgery. The use of TXA for proximal humeral fracture surgery has yet to be evaluated. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of TXA on blood loss in patients undergoing open reduction-internal fixation (ORIF) or arthroplasty for the treatment of proximal humeral fractures. Materials and methods: A total of 101 patients were randomized to receive either a single preoperative dose of intravenous TXA (53 patients) or a control dose of saline solution (48 patients) at the time of proximal humeral fracture surgery. On the basis of patient age and fracture pattern, ORIF was performed in 57 patients (30 TXA and 27 control patients) and reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) was performed in the other 44 patients (23 TXA and 21 control patients). Intraoperative blood loss plus 24-hour drain output was used to calculate total blood loss for each procedure. The preoperative-to-postoperative change in hemoglobin level was also evaluated for each patient. Further stratification of blood loss and change in hemoglobin level based on procedure (ORIF or RSA) was performed as well. Results: Compared with the control group, the TXA group had less average intraoperative blood loss (178 mL vs. 129 mL, P < .0001), less postoperative drain output (103 mL vs. 62 mL, P < .0001), and less total blood loss (280 mL vs. 188 mL, P < .0001). Compared with the control group, the TXA group had a smaller average preoperative-to-postoperative change in hemoglobin level (-2.6 g/dL vs. -1.5 g/dL, P < .0001). Further stratification based on procedure showed that among patients undergoing ORIF and patients undergoing RSA, those receiving TXA had less average total blood loss and a smaller decrease in hemoglobin level than the control group. No identifiable intraoperative or postoperative complications associated with the use of TXA occurred in any patient. Conclusion: TXA was effective in reducing total blood loss and led to a smaller preoperative-to-postoperative decrease in hemoglobin level compared with control in patients undergoing surgery for proximal humeral fractures. This effect was consistent in patients treated with either ORIF or arthroplasty as the surgical procedure. TXA can be used to decrease blood loss in the surgical treatment of proximal humeral fractures. (C) 2020 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees. All rights reserved.

The Asia proximal femoral nail antirotation versus the standard proximal femoral antirotation nail for unstable intertrochanteric fractures in elderly Chinese patients	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						PFNA; PFNA-II; Unstable intertrochanteric fractures; Chinese	DYNAMIC HIP SCREW; INTERNAL-FIXATION; GAMMA-NAIL; ARTHROPLASTY; IMPLANT; COMPLICATIONS; TROCHANTER; DEVICE	Background: The best options of internal fixation for unstable intertrochanteric fractures in elderly Chinese patients remain controversial. The Asia proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA-II) was specifically designed for Asian patients, which could be more effective than the regular proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA). Compared to PFNA, whether PFNA-II is associated with shorter operative time and lower rates of complications is unknown. Hypothesis: The rate of complications using PFNA-II is lower than PFNA for the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures in elderly Chinese patients, and the operation using PFNA-II is quicker. Materials and methods: Between June 2008 and December 2011, 188 patients with unstable intertrochanteric fractures treated with the PFNA-II (n = 118) or PFNA (n = 70) were retrospectively evaluated. Follow-up evaluations were performed at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, and every year thereafter. According to residual valgus-varus deformation, the quality of the fracture reduction was graded as poor (>10 degrees deformation), acceptable (5 to 10 deformation), or good (<5 deformation). The operative time, intraoperative blood loss, overall time of fluoroscopy, blood transfusion volume, postoperative drainage, length of hospital stay and postoperative complications were recorded. Results: The mean operative time in the PFNA-II group was significantly shorter than that in the PFNA group (66.25 +/- 13.15 vs 79.50 +/- 21.12 minutes; < 0.05), intraoperative blood loss was smaller (131.86 +/- 69.16 vs 162.14 +/- 66.18 mL; 13 < 0.05), and fewer local complications were observed (25% vs 46%; 13 < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the postoperative blood transfusions, overall time of fluoroscopy, postoperative drainage, length of hospital stay, fracture reduction, the position of the implant and tip apex distance between the two groups. At follow-up, no significant difference was found between the two groups in Harris hip score (HHS) (86.19 +/- 6.53 vs 85.27 +/- 5.47; 13 > 0.05), visual analogue scale (VAS) (0.87 +/- 0.85 vs 0.97 +/- 0.87; 13 > 0.05). Discussion: Due to its special design for the Asian population, PFNA-II offers a better match with the Chinese people's proximal femur anatomic structure. This study showed that the rate of complications using PFNA-II is lower than PFNA for the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures in elderly Chinese patients, and the operation time is shorter. Level of evidence: Level III, case control study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Quantifying carbon fixation in trace minerals from processed kimberlite: A comparative study of quantitative methods using X-ray powder diffraction data with applications to the Diavik Diamond Mine, Northwest Territories, Canada	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; PHASE-ANALYSIS; NEUTRALIZATION POTENTIALS; PREFERRED ORIENTATION; WEATHERING PRODUCTS; RIETVELD METHOD; SINGLE-CRYSTAL; STATIC TESTS; CO2; SERPENTINE	The capacity of mine waste to trap CO2 is, in some cases, much larger than the greenhouse gas production of a mining operation. In mine tailings, the presence of secondary carbonate minerals that trap CO2 can therefore represent substantial fixation of this greenhouse gas. The abilities of three methods of quantitative phase analysis to measure trace nesquehonite (MgCO3 center dot 3H(2)O) in samples of processed kimberlite have been assessed: the method of reference intensity ratios (RIR), the internal standard method, and the Rietveld method with X-ray powder diffraction data. Tests on synthetic mixtures made to resemble processed kimberlite indicate that both the RIR and Rietveld methods can be used accurately to quantify nesquehonite to a lower limit of approximately 0.5 wt.% for conditions used in the laboratory. Below this value, estimates can be made to a limit of approximately 0.1 wt.% using a calibration curve according to the internal standard method. The RIR method becomes increasingly unreliable with decreasing abundance of nesquehonite, primarily as a result of an unpredictable decline in preferred orientation of crystallites. For Rietveld refinements, structureless pattern fitting was used to account for planar disorder in lizardite by considering it as an amorphous phase. Rietveld refinement of data collected from specimens that were serrated to minimize preferred orientation of crystallites gives rise to systematic overestimates of refined abundances for lizardite and underestimates for other phases. The resulting pattern of misestimates may be mistaken for the effect of amorphous and/or nanocrystalline material in samples. This effect is mitigated by collecting data from non-serrated specimens, which typically give relative errors on refined abundances for major and minor phases in the range of 5-20%. However, relative error can increase rapidly for abundances less than 5 wt.%. Nonetheless, absolute errors are sufficiently small that estimates can be made for the amount of CO2 stored in secondary nesquehonite using the RIR method or the Rietveld method for abundances >= 0.5 wt.% and a calibration curve for abundances <0.5 wt.%. The extent to which C is being mineralized in an active mine setting at the Diavik Diamond Mine Northwest Territories, Canada, has been investigated. Rietveld refinement results and calibrated abundances for trace nesquehonite are used to estimate the amount of CO2 trapped in Diavik tailings. Results of quantitative phase analysis are also used to calculate neutralization potentials for the kimberlite mine tailings and to estimate the contribution made by secondary nesquehonite.

Examination of <i>Homalometron elongatum</i> Manter, 1947 and Description of a New Congener from <i>Eucinostomus currani</i> Zahuranec, 1980 in the Pacific Ocean off Costa Rica	COMPARATIVE PARASITOLOGY			English	Article						Homalometron elongatum; Homalometron lesliorum n. sp.; Apocreadiidae; Trematoda; fishes; Gerres cinereus; Eucinostomus currani; Gerreidae; Puerto Rico; Costa Rica; Nicaragua	N-SP PLATYHELMINTHES; BARRIER-REEF; DIGENEA; MORPHOLOGY; TREMATODA; FISHES	Homalometron elongatum is reexamined using heat-killed material that was not subjected to pressure during fixation from Gerres cinereus collected from San Juan Harbor, Puerto Rico, U.S.A. The new material is compared with some paratype specimens and differs by having a much less variable forebody length, and a median rather than submedian genital pore. Tegumental spines reportedly cover the anterior end of the body but we observed tegumental spines covering the entire body surface in both the paratype and new material. Homalometron lesliorum n. sp. is described from Eucinostomus currani from the Pacific coasts of Costa Rica and Nicaragua. The new species has 3 pairs of oral papillae surrounding the mouth and thus resembles 3 other congeners: H. elongatum, Homalometron carapevae, and Homalometron papilliferum. Homalometron lesliorum n. sp. is distinguished from the 3 species by having the anterior extent of the vitelline follicles at or above the base of the ventral sucker, compared with posterior to the ventral sucker at the level of the seminal vesicle (H. elongation) or further posterior at the posterior margin of the ovary (H. carapevae and H. papilliferum). The 4 species are further differentiated from one another by sucker width ratio, tegumental spine size and distribution, egg size, host preference, and biogeography. Comparison of nuclear ribosomal DNA (3' end of 18S, internal transcribed spacer [ITS]1, ITS2, and 5' end of 28S) between H. elongatum and H. lesliorum n. sp. revealed I variable base (n = 162) at the 3' end of 18S, 12 variable bases (n = 476) at ITS1, 10 variable bases (n = 310) at 1TS2, and 11 variable bases (n = 1,325) at the 5' end fragment of 28S. Nuclear ribosomal DNA from Homalometron pallidum and Homalometron armatum are included for further comparison with H. elongatum and H. lesliorum n. sp.

However, lower degradation and bacterial infection are still major concerns. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we have incorporated copper (Cu) in Fe -Mn system. The objective is to produce Cu nano-precipitates and refined microstructure through suitable combination of cold-rolling and age-treatment, so that degradation is improved eventually. High reso-lution transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) confirmed the Cu rich composition of the nano-precipitates. Number of precipitates increased as ag-ing time increased. Three-dimensional visualization of Fe, Mn and Cu atomic distributions using atom probe tomography (APT), indicated that Cu precipitates were in 15-50 nm range. Large number of nano-precipitates along with lower dislocation density led to highest strength (1078 MPa) and ductility (37 %) for the 6 h age-treated sample. On the other hand, nano-precipitates and refined microstructure resulted highest degradation for the 12 h of age treated sample (0.091 mmpy). When E.Coli bacteria was cultured with the sample extract, significantly higher antibacterial efficacy was observed for the sample having higher nano-precipitates. Higher degradation rate did not cause cyto-toxicity, rather promoted statisti-cally higher cell proliferation (1.5 times within 24 h) in in vitro cell-material interaction studies. In vivo biocompatibility of the alloy containing large nano-precipitates was confirmed from higher new bone regeneration (60%) in rabbit femur model. Overall study suggested that the optimization of the thermo-mechanical processes can effectively tailor the Fe-Mn-Cu alloys for successful internal fracture fixation. Statement of significance In the present work, we have reported a noble thermo-mechanical approach to simultaneously achieve Cu nano-precipitates and grain refinement in Fe-20Mn-3Cu alloy. & BULL; Significant reduction in bacterial growth was observed in the sample containing high Cu precipitation. This is extremely significant in the present context. & BULL; Cu nano-precipitates and grain refinement improved the degradation rate. & BULL; Highest yield strength was observed after 12 h of age treatment (493 MPa). We have theoretically calculated various factors of yield strength. & BULL; High degradation rate did not cause cytotoxicity, rather promoted cell viability. & BULL; We have reported that the released Cu ion concentration in vivo was not only below toxic limit, but also helped in new bone regeneration.& COPY; 2023 Acta Materialia Inc.

However, standard autologous bone grafting has been associated with donor site morbidity and/or limited quantity. As an alternate, allografts with or without metallic or polyether-etherketone have been used as grafting substitutes. However, these may have drawbacks as well, including stress shielding, pseudarthrosis, disease-transmission, and infection. There is therefore a need for alternative bone substitutes, such as the use of mechanically compliant three-dimensional (3D)-printed scaffolds. Several off-the-shelf materials are available for low-cost fused deposition 3D printing such as polylactic acid (PLA) and polycaprolactone (PCL). We have previously described the feasibility of 3D-printed PLA scaffolds to support cell activity and extracellular matrix deposition. In this study, we investigate two medical-grade filaments consistent with specifications found in American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard for semi-crystalline polylactide polymers for surgical implants, a pure polymer (100M) and a copolymeric material (7415) for their cytocompatibility and suitability in bone tissue engineering. Moreover, we assessed the impact on osteo-inductive properties with the addition of beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) minerals and assessed their mechanical properties. 100M and 7415 scaffolds with the additive beta-TCP demonstrated superior mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) differentiation detected via increased alkaline phosphatase activity (6-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively) and mineralized matrix deposition (14-fold and 5-fold, respectively) in vitro. Furthermore, we evaluated in vivo compatibility, biosafety and bone repair potential in a rat femur window defect model. 100M(+beta-TCP) implants displayed a positive biosafety profile and showed significantly enhanced new bone formation compared to 100M implants evidenced by mu CT (39 versus 25% bone volume/tissue volume ratio) and histological analysis 6 weeks post-implantation. These scaffolds are encouraging composite biomaterials for repairing bone applications with a great potential for clinical translation. Further analyses are required with appropriate evaluation in a larger critical-sized defect animal model with long-term follow-up.

Effect of humeral component version on impingement in reverse total shoulder arthroplasty	JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY			English	Article						Reverse total shoulder; humeral version; impingement; scapular notching; range of motion	OPTIMIZING GLENOSPHERE POSITION; TRANSVERSE PLANE; PROXIMAL HUMERUS; PROSTHESIS; CUFF; ARTHRITIS; FIXATION	Hypothesis: Reverse shoulder arthroplasty is growing in popularity for patients with deficient rotator cuffs; however, the phenomenon of scapular notching continues to be a concern. This study examined the effects of humeral component version in the Aequalis Reversed Shoulder Prosthesis (Tornier, Edina, MN) on impingement of the humeral prosthesis against the scapula to test the hypothesis that the mechanical contact of the humeral component with the scapular neck is influenced by the version of the humeral component. Materials and methods: Seven shoulders from deceased donors were tested after the Aequalis Reversed Shoulder was implanted. The deltoid, pectoralis major, and latissimus dorsi were loaded based on physiologic cross-sectional area. The degree of internal and external rotation when impingement, subluxation, or dislocation occurred was measured at 0 degrees, 30 degrees, and 60 degrees glenohumeral abduction in the scapular plane. Testing was performed with the humeral component placed in 20 degrees of anteversion, neutral version, 20 degrees of retroversion, and 40 degrees of retroversion. Results: Maximum external rotation at 0 degrees abduction was -1 degrees +/- 4 degrees at 20 degrees anteversion, 15 degrees +/- 3 degrees at neutral, 28 degrees +/- 4 degrees at 20 degrees retroversion, and 44 degrees +/- 5 degrees at 40 degrees retroversion (P<.05). Maximum internal rotation at 0 degrees abduction was 128 degrees +/- 9 degrees at 20 degrees anteversion, 112 degrees +/- 9 degrees at neutral, 99 degrees +/- 8 degrees at 20 degrees retroversion, and 83 degrees +/- 8 degrees at 40 degrees retroversion (P<.05). Maximum external rotation at 30 degrees abduction was 70 degrees +/- 6 degrees at 20 degrees anteversion, 84 degrees +/- 7 degrees at neutral, 97 degrees +/- 6 degrees at 20 degrees retroversion, and 110 degrees +/- 5 degrees at 40 degrees retroversion (P<.05). There was no limitation to internal rotation at 30 degrees abduction. No impingement occurred at 60 degrees abduction. Discussion: Version of the humeral component plays a role in range of motion and impingement in reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. Anteversion can significantly decrease the amount of external rotation achievable after reverse total shoulder surgery. Conclusion: Placing the Aequalis Reversed Shoulder humeral component at between 20 degrees and 40 degrees of retroversion more closely restores a functional arc of motion without impingement.

Angularand axial stability of a plate-screw construct call be achieved using a conically threaded screw head undersurface and a corresponding conically threaded plate hole. Furthermore, the insertion angle of the screw must correspond precisely to the axis of the screw hole. This is not always achieved in clinical practice and may result in screw loosening. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between the stability of the locked screw-plate on the insertion angle of the screw. Methods: Locking screws were inserted in an isolated (Point Contact Fixator, PC-Fix) or combined (Locking Compression Plate, LCP 4.5) locking hole with the use of an aiming device. The optimal insertion angle for these plates is perpendicular to the plate surface. The screws were inserted with an axis deviation of 0degrees (optimal condition), 5degrees, and- 10degrees respective to the optimal angle (variance +/- 1degrees). The samples were tested under shear or axial (push out) loading conditions until failure occurred. An Instron materials testing machine was used. Results: Locking screws inserted in the isolated locking hole (PC-Fix) showed a significant decrease of failure load if inserted at 5degrees and 10degrees angle. Using an optimal insertion angle (0degrees), failure load was 1480 +/- 390 N, with 5degrees axis deviation 780 +/- 160 N, P = 0.0001, and with 10degrees axis deviation 550 +/- 110 N, P=0.0001. Screws inserted in the combined locking hole (LCP) also showed a significant decrease of push-out force of 77% (4960 +/- 1000 N versus 1120 +/- 400 N) with 10degrees axis deviation. Compared to optimal insertion angle (0degrees), bending load to failure did decrease up to 69% (1240 +/- 210 N vs. 390 100 N) with 10degrees axis deviation. Conclusion: A locking head screw exhibits high stability with a moderate axis deviation in the angle of insertion of up to 5degrees. However, there is a significant decrease in stability with increasing axis deviation (>5degrees). An aiming device is recommended to provide optimal fixation with angular stability.

The goal of this research was to study the effects on long-term bone healing of fixture surface acid-etching and machined collar design. Method and Materials: Three two-part implant types were compared: standard Branemark (with an external-hex 1.2 mm long machined flat collar), Swede-Vent (a copy of the Branemark design, with an identical collar but a fixture surface acid-etched to 1 to 3 mu m), and Screw-Vent (with a fixture surface acid-etched identically to that of Swede-Vent, but a longer internal-hex machined flat collar that did not require countersinking). Fifty-eight subjects each received the three types in alternate fashion at five sites between mental foramen, and a fixed full-arch prosthesis. Abutment-implant interface/ microgap (MG) was placed at the crest, and first bone-to-implant contact point-to microgap (fBIC-MG) was measured at mesial and distal sides of each implant. Mean fBIC-MG values were compared after 15 to 20 years of function. Statistical analysis was based on the mixed linear model with the level of significance set at P < .05 and Bonferroni correction for pairwise comparisons. Results: Branemark had less mean marginal bone loss (-1.08 mm, standard error [SE] 0.20) compared with Swede-Vent (-1.28 mm, SE 0.20), but pairwise comparisons showed that the difference was not statistically significant (mean difference of 0.20 mm, P = .662). Screw-Vent had the greatest loss (-1.92 mm, SE 0.20), and pairwise comparisons showed that the difference was statistically significant compared with Branemark and Swede-Vent (difference = 0.64 mm, P < .001). Conclusion: According to accepted standards for osseointegration, all three implant types achieved very acceptable long-term results. However, while Branemark had the least bone loss, the implant with the acidetched fixture surface and longer internal-hex collar design had the greatest loss. Within the confines of this study, shorter collar length of 1.2 mm may be more important to limit long-term bone loss with microgap placed at the crest.

This prospective cohort study was performed to determine if similar health beliefs exist among athletically active Hindu patients from Nepal following primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Materials and methods: Twenty-five consecutive patients (21 men, 4 women) of 26.7 +/- 7.7 years of age participated in this study at 4.2 +/- 2 months post-surgery. All subjects had undergone primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft, with anteromedial portal use for femoral tunnel drilling and interference screw fixation. Subjects completed the Knee Outcome Survey - Sports Activities Scale symptoms and functional limitations during sports subscales and Form C of the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control scales. Descriptive and correlational statistical analysis was performed. An alpha level of p < 0.05 was selected to indicate statistical significance. Results: Knee Outcome Survey - Sports Activity Scale symptoms scores were 71.3 +/- 18 (range = 43-97) and functional limitations scores were 42.4 +/- 34 (range = 10-95). Multidimensional Health Locus of Control subscale scores were Internal (27.8 +/- 4.6), Chance (21.5 +/- 6.3), Doctors (16.1 +/- 1.9) and other people (14 +/- 3.5). Significant relationships were not observed between symptoms or functional limitations subscale scores and Multidimensional Health Locus of Control internal, doctors or powerful others subscale scores. However, strong (r = 0.72) and moderately strong (r = 0.48) relationships were observed between the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control chance subscale score and Knee Outcome Survey - Sports Activities Scale functional limitations and symptoms subscales, respectively. Conclusion: Following primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Hindu patients from Nepal displayed strong relationships between perceived knee function and symptoms and the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control chance subscale. Identification and targeting the beliefs of patients may be clinically important to facilitating positive treatment progression and behavioral changes during post-surgical rehabilitation programs. Further studies are needed to determine how medical and rehabilitation clinicians who provide care to patients from eastern, collectivist cultures can optimize healthcare strategies for patients with sociocultural or religious/spirituality influences that possess strong chance or luck beliefs.

Materials and Methods: The following zirconia abutments were divided into four groups of 20 each. StraumannCARES abutments on Straumann implants (group A), Procera abutments on Branemark implants (group 8), Procera abutments on Nobel-Replace implants (group C). and Zirabut SynOcta prototype abutments on Straumann implants (group D). The abutments were fixed on their respective implants either internally via a secondary abutment (A) or a metallic coupling (C) (two-piece) or directly externally (B) and internally (D) (one-piece). In each group, 10 abutments were left unrestored (A1 to D1). Ten received glass-ceramic crowns (A2 to D2). Static loading was performed according to the ISO norm 14801 until failure. The bending moment was calculated for comparison of the groups and subjected to statistical analysis (Student t test). Results: The mean bending moments of the unrestored abutments were 371.5 +/- 142.3 Ncm (A1), 276.5 +/- 47.6 Ncm (B1), 434 9 +/- 124.8 Ncm (C1), and 182.5 +/- 136.5 Ncm (D1). Two-piece internally connected abutments exhibited higher bending moments than one-piece internally (C1 versus D1 P = .003, A1 versus D1 P = .03) or externally (C1 versus B1 P = .004) connected abutments. The groups with restorations did not show different bending moments than those without restorations The mean bending moments of the restored abutments were 283 3 +/- 44 8 Ncm (A2), 291.5 +/- 31.7 Ncm (B2), 3515 58 Ncm (C2), and 184.3 +/- 77 7 Ncm (D2). Group C2 exhibited the highest bending moment (P < .05). Internally connected one-piece abutments (D2) were weaker than all other groups (D2 versus A2 P = .002; D2 versus B2 P = .001; D2 versus C2 P = .0003). Conclusions: The type of connection significantly influenced the strength of zirconia abutments. Superior strength was achieved by means of internal connection via a secondary metallic component.

An In Vitro Evaluation of the Loosening of Different Interchangeable Abutments in Internal-Connection-Type Implants	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL IMPLANTS			English	Article						cyclic loading; implant abutment; implant-abutment stability; internal-connection-type implant; removal torque; screw loosening	FATIGUE RESISTANCE; DESIGN; DISPLACEMENT; INTERFACE; JUNCTION	Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the loosening of interchangeable one-piece abutments connected to internal-connection-type implants after cyclic loading. Materials and Methods: Four implant abutment groups (n = 7 in each group) with Straumann tissue-level implants were assessed: Straumann solid abutment (group S), Southern Implants solid abutment (group SI), Implant Direct straight abutment (group ID), and Blue Sky Bio regular platform abutment (group BSB). The implant was firmly held in a special jig to ensure fixation. Abutment screws were tightened to manufacturers' recommended torque with a digital torque gauge. The hemispherical loading members were fabricated for the load cell of a universal testing machine to evenly distribute the force on the specimens and to fulfill the ISO 14801: 2007 standard. A cyclic loading of 25 N at 30 degrees to the implant's long axis was applied for a duty of a half million cycles. Tightening torques were measured prior to the loading. Removal torques were measured after cyclic loading. The data were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the significance level was set at P < .05. Results: The mean removal torques after cyclic loading were 34.0 +/- 1.1 Ncm (group S), 25.0 +/- 1.5 Ncm (group SI), 23.9 +/- 2.1 Ncm (group ID), and 27.9 +/- 1.3 Ncm (group BSB). Removal torques of each group were statistically different in the order of group S > group BSB > groups SI and ID (P < .05). The mean reduction rates were -2.9% +/- 3.2% (group S), -21.9% +/- 4.8% (group SI), -20.2% +/- 7.2% (group ID), and -6.9% +/- 4.3% (group BSB) after a half million cycles, respectively. Reduction rates of groups S and BSB were statistically lower than those of groups SI and ID (P < .01). The standard deviation of group S was lower than group BSB. Conclusion: The removal torque of the original Straumann abutment was significantly higher than those of the copy abutments. The reduction rate of the groups S and BSB abutments was lower than those of the other copy abutments.

Direct Radiography Following Fracture Reduction Improves the Reliability of Pauwels Classification	ACTA CHIRURGIAE ORTHOPAEDICAE ET TRAUMATOLOGIAE CECHOSLOVACA			English	Article						femoral neck fracture; Pauwels classification; reliability; inter-observer; intra-observer	FEMORAL-NECK FRACTURES; FIXATION	PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Pauwels classification system is widely used to classify the femoral neck fractures. Even its widely usage there are severals debates about its reliability. After the femoral neck fracture occured the lower extremity rotates externally and this external rotation deformity could lead to misevaluation of Pauwels angle at the initial radiographs. The purpose of our study is to investigate whether the reliability of Pauwels classification increases after reduction of femoral neck fractures. MATERIAL AND METHODS Two power point presentation was prepared with 117 slides that include antero-posterior radiographs of each femoral neck fracture. The first one included preoperatively taken radiographs and the second one included early postoperatively taken radiographs. Eight observers evaluated these radiographs and they classified the fractures according to Pauwels classification system. After 3 months, the order of the slides were changed for each presentation and the observers were asked to evaluate the radiographs again. Intraclass correlation coefficient values were calculated for evaluation of inter- and intra-observer reliability. RESULTS The mean intra-observer agreement of preoperative evaluation was 0.406 (0.071-0.626) and the interobserver agreements were 0.263 (0.197-0.342) and 0.359 (0.287-0.447), respectively. The intra-observer agreement of postoperative evaluation was 0.508 (0.393-0.757), inter-observer agreements were 0.427 (0.353-0.509) and 0.431 (0.356-0.513), respectively. According to preoperative and postoperative evaluations, 6 of 8 observers' intra-observer agreements were found to be increased and the remaining 2 decreased. Interobserver reliability was improved from poor to fair-good values after evaluating the reducted fracture radiographs. DISCUSSION Femoral neck fractures(FNF) are common and anatomical reduction and internal fixation are preferred as a treatment option in young people and patients have good bone quality. Pauwels classification system is used for classify the FNF based on the shearing angle of the fracture line. As this angle increases, the fracture becomes unstable and nowadays stronger fixation devices are preferred for unstable fractures. Therefore, misevaluation of the fracture can lead to wrong treatment method selection. Non-optimal X-rays taken in the emergency rooms may cause misinterpretation of femoral neck fractures according to Pauwels classification system. We hypothized that the reliability of this classification system could be improved after reduction of the fracture. CONCLUSIONS Our study showed that classifying the femoral neck fracture according to Pauwels classification system is more confidential after the reduction, however we can not state that it's reliability is adequate.

To minimize stress shielding, a new carbon fiber (CF)/Flax/Epoxy composite plate has been developed and biomechanically compared to a standard clinical metal plate. For fatigue tests, experiments were done using six artificial femurs cyclically loaded through the femoral head in axial compression for four stages: Stage 1 (intact), stage 2 (after THR insertion), stage 3 (after plate fixation of a simulated Vancouver B1 femoral midshaft fracture gap), and stage 4 (after fracture gap healing). For fracture fixation, one group was fitted with the new CF/Flax/Epoxy plate (n = 3), whereas another group was repaired with a standard clinical metal plate (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN) (n = 3). In addition to axial stiffness measurements, infrared thermography technique was used to capture the femur and plate surface stresses during the testing. Moreover, finite element analysis (FEA) was performed to evaluate the composite plate's axial stiffness and surface stress field. Experimental results showed that the CF/Flax/Epoxy plated femur had comparable axial stiffness (fractured = 645 +/- 67 N/mm; healed = 1731 +/- 109 N/mm) to the metal-plated femur (fractured = 658 +/- 69 N/mm; healed = 1751 +/- 39 N/mm) (p = 1.00). However, the bone beneath the CF/Flax/Epoxy plate was the only area that had a significantly higher average surface stress (fractured = 2.10 +/- 0.66 MPa; healed = 1.89 +/- 0.39 MPa) compared to bone beneath the metal plate (fractured = 1.18 +/- 0.93 MPa; healed = 0.71 +/- 0.24 MPa) (p<0.05). FEA bone surface stresses yielded peak of 13 MPa at distal epiphysis (stage 1), 16 MPa at distal epiphysis (stage 2), 85 MPa for composite and 129 MPa for metal-plated femurs at the vicinity of nearest screw just proximal to fracture (stage 3), 21 MPa for composite and 24 MPa for metal-plated femurs at the vicinity of screw farthest away distally from fracture (stage 4). These results confirm that the new CF/Flax/Epoxy material could be a potential candidate for bone fracture plate applications as it can simultaneously provide similar mechanical stiffness and lower stress shielding (i.e., higher bone stress) compared to a standard clinical metal bone plate.

So far reverse prostheses with different humeral inclination (HI) angles have been used. However, it has not been investigated yet if the HI angle affects the primary stability of the tuberosity fixation in primary reverse total shoulder arthroplasty for proximal humeral fractures in a biomechanical setting. Methods: A 4-part fracture was created in 7-paired human cadaver proximal humeri after preceding power analysis. After randomization in a pairwise fashion, reverse prostheses with either 135 degrees (n = 7) or 155 degrees (n = 7) were implanted. The tuberosities were reduced anatomically to the metaphysic of the prostheses and were fixed with 3 suture cerclages in a standardized technique. Tightening was performed with a cerclage tension device with 50 Newton meter (N m). Before biomechanical testing, the initial vertical and horizontal gap formation was measured. The humeri were placed in a custom-made test setup enabling internal and external rotation. Cyclic loading with a gradually increasing load magnitude was applied with a material testing machine starting with 20 N in and increasing by 5 N m after each 100th cycle until failure (>15 degrees rotation of the tuberosities). Any motion of the tuberosities was measured with a 3-dimensional camera system. Results: Overall, the 155 degrees group reached an average of 1460 +/- 270 cycles and the 135 degrees group of 1900 +/- 271 cycles (P = .048) . In contrast to the 135 degrees group, in the 155' group, a mean initial vertical (03 +/- 0.7 mm) and horizontal (2.7 +/- 3.3 mm) gap formation could be observed before cyclic loading. After 1100 cycles, the 155 degrees group showed increased rotation of both lesser and greater tuberosities in all 3 axes around the humeral shaft compared with the 135 degrees group. Conclusion: Primary stability of the reattached tuberosities is significantly increased, whereas rotational movements are decreased in prostheses with an anatomic HI of 135 degrees compared with a 155 degrees HI according to the original Grammont design. In addition, a 135 degrees HI allows an exact anatomic reposition of the tuberosities, whereas this was not possible for the 155 degrees design. However, transferability and clinical relevance of these biomechanical results have to be verified with clinical studies. (C) 2020 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

The authors performed a retrospective study of maxillofacial fracture patients in whom maxillofacial osteosynthesis miniplates were inserted or removed at the Kagawa Prefectural Central Hospital, between 2008 and 2017. Predictive variables were age, sex, fracture site distribution, and time to miniplate removal with or without complications in relation to primary outcome variables. Among 185 patients, 440 miniplates were inserted and 272 miniplates were removed. In total, 116 patients (73.4%) had 282 miniplates (64.1%) removed, of which 4.8% fracture sites and 5.7% miniplates were removed because of complications. The mean time to miniplate removal was 630.9 and 258.0 days in patients with and without complications, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in miniplate removal and miniplate retention relative to age and sex. This difference was not related to the presence or absence of sex- or age-related complications. The miniplates as osteosynthesis material were safe and useful for a long period of time with relatively few complications. Because complications requiring miniplate removal occurred within 1 or after 5 years postoperatively, osteosynthesis miniplate treatments should be decided while considering the patient's age and sex. Long-term follow-up is recommended for miniplates that remain implanted for >1 year.

Material and methods: This survey was performed in three hospitals of Ribeirao Preto in Sao Paulo, Brazil, from August 2002 to July 2008. The records of 1575 patients with facial trauma were reviewed. There were 140 cases of ZOC and ZA fractures either associated with other facial fractures or not. Data regarding gender, age, race, addictions, day of trauma, etiology, signs and symptoms, oral hygiene condition, day of initial evaluation, hospital admission, day of surgery, surgery approach, pattern of fractures, treatment performed, post-operative antibiotic therapy, day of hospital discharge, and post-operative complications were collected. The data were subjected to descriptive statistical analyses. Results: The most frequent fractures affected Caucasian men and occurred during the fourth decade of life. The most frequent etiology was traffic accident, and symptoms and signs included pain and edema. Type I fractures were the main injury observed, and the treatment of choice was always rigid internal fixation. Post-operative antibiotic therapy was solely employed when there was an indication. Complications were observed in 13.1% of the cases. Conclusions: The treatment protocol yielded suitable post-operative results and also showed success rates comparable to published data around the world.

This study evaluated the epidemiology of maxillofacial fractures and treatment plans in hospitalized patients in Northeast of Iran (2015-2016). Material and Methods: In this retrospective study, the medical records of 502 hospitalized patients were evaluated in the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery in Kamyab Hospital in Mashhad, Iran. The type and cause of fractures and treatment plans were recorded in a checklist. Data were analyzed with Mann-Whitney test, chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test, using SPSS 21. Results: The majority of patients were male (80.3%). Most subjects were in 20-30-year age range (43.2%). The fractures were mostly caused by accidents, particularly motorcycle accidents (MCAs), and the most common site of involvement was the body of the mandible. There was a significant association between the type of treatment and age. In fact, the age range of 16-59 years underwent open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) more than other age ranges (P=0.001). Also, there was a significant association between gender and fractures (P=0.002). Conclusions: It was concluded that patient age and gender and trauma significantly affected the prevalence of maxillofacial traumas, fracture types and treatment plans. This information would be useful for making better health policy strategies.

Only by evaluating long follow-up studies conducted with large-volume data that guidelines about when to remove and why remove plates used for internal rigid fixation can be traced. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted as a retrospective study. Clinical findings of all the patients presented at the department of maxillofacial surgery of 2 Italian hospitals, in whom miniplates were inserted between January 2004 and December 2007, were included: a follow-up of these patients was conducted until August 2009. Results: The region most involved with plates' insertion was the upper maxilla (49.8%), followed by mandibular body (38.1%), angle (7.9%), condyle (2.4%), and symphysis (1.8%). The region most involved in plates' removal was the maxilla in 9%, followed by mandibular body in the 7.5%. All plates inserted in angle regions were removed. Plates placed in the condylar area did not need any plate removal. Conclusions: From this study, there is no evidence to support the advice for routine removal of titanium miniplates from the maxillofacial skeleton, although when using plates in the mandibular angle region, it would be necessary to inform the patient about the very high probability of a second operation necessary for the plates' removal.

In September 2019, the rules for motorcycle and helmet use were modified to compulsory use in the state of Karnataka. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of mandatory helmet use on maxillofacial fractures and injuries in Sullia Taluk, Karnataka. Materials and methods The study was based on the information obtained from clinical records in the K.V.G Dental College and the K.V.G Medical College from February 2019 to February 2020. The inclusion criteria were subjects who met with two-wheeler accidents with complete case records and radiological investigations. Results A total of 78 individuals reported with maxillofacial trauma from February 2019 to February 2020. The mean age was 31 +/- 14 years. There were 74 (94%) males and 4 (6%) females. Forty-nine cases reported before the mandatory helmet use rule and 29 cases reported after the helmet use rule. There was a 36.3% decrease in the incidence of maxillofacial trauma, 23.5% decrease in fractures, and an 89% reduction in the number of victims who underwent open reduction and internal fixation during the post-law period. Conclusion There was a significant reduction in the incidence and severity of maxillofacial trauma after the implementation of the helmet rule.

A comprehensive analysis of the thermal, rheological, and mechanical properties of these biocomposites was performed. TCP presented proper distribution in the PLA/TCP biocomposites: PLA5TCP and PLA10TCP exhibited rheological behavior similar to that of neat PLA. However, PLA25TCP presented significant agglomeration and reduction in thermal stability. Addition of TCP to the biocomposites enhanced their bioactivity and biocompatibility. The bioactivity assay was conducted by immersing the samples in SBF solution for 7 and 21 days, and the SEM and XRD surface analyses of the PLA/TCP biocomposites presented evidence of carbonated hydroxyapatite formation. The biocompatibility assay was performed using the extract method until 7 days, and PLA10TCP presented improved relative cell viability compared with the control. Finally, since the materials presented suitable thermal and rheological properties, filaments for additive manufacturing (AM) were developed, and they were used to produce screw models for bone-ligament fixation. The 3D printed screws exhibited excellent printability and accuracy. Therefore, the PLA/TCP biocomposites developed can be used in further biomedical applications using AM, namely, guided bone tissue engineering.

In patients with very distal fractures and severe comminution, primary arthroplasty has been advocated. Recently, a few reports have described promising results of hemiarthroplasty. This study describes the medium-term results of using the Kudo humeral implant (Biomet Ltd, Bridgend, U. K.) as replacement of the distal humerus. Material and methods: Eight women (mean age, 79 years) were treated. Follow-up was conducted at a mean of 4 years after the procedure and consisted of the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS), radiographic images, and range of motion (ROM). Results: All patients had a good or excellent outcome according to the MEPS. Mean ROM was 31 degrees to 126 degrees. Radiographic signs of attrition of the ulna were observed in 3 patients but did not correlate with the functional outcome. A periprosthetic fracture occurred in 1 patient 3 years after the index operation, and ROM was unsatisfactory in 1 patient. No other complications were observed. Conclusion: The use of the Kudo humeral implant as a hemiarthroplasty resulted in a reasonable functional outcome in the medium-term, but the radiographic signs of attrition suggest that the implant is not recommended as a hemiprosthesis.

They are known from Japan, the Red Sea, the North Atlantic islands of Bermuda and the Bahamas, and the Caribbean and in a variety of habitats including the rocky intertidal, among Thalassia sea grass, on filamentous algae and decaying mangrove leaves. Certain color morphs associated with each of these habitats seem to have confused the taxonomy of the group. While brown-and-white banding and spotting patterns of Hofstenia miamia and Hofstenia giselae are distinctive for species associated with mangrove leaves and Thallasia sp. and are likely to be cryptic for these specific environments, we find some evidence to suggest that the coloration is mimicry of a nudibranch with aposematic coloration. The common plan in these patterns is one with three variously solid or spotted lighter cross bands on a dark background. Our examination of museum type material and live specimens of Hofstenia collected from Bahamas, Belize, Bermuda, and Panama revealed no internal morphological differences between the Hofstenia species occurring in the Caribbean. Similarly, our analyses of 18S and 28S molecular sequence data revealed no significant differences among specimens. Accordingly, we declare that Hofstenia giselae is a junior synonym of Hofstenia miamia, the three- banded panther worm.

One of the causes is increased muscular activity. This makes the treatment of deep bite malocclusions difficult and often results in relapse in many cases. In this work we compared patients with surgical orthognathic treatment only and surgical orthognathic treatment with additional injections of botulinum toxin after mandibular advancement for class II division 2 malocclusion. Material and methods: This is a prospective study. Adult patients were assessed pretreatment (T1), posttreatment (T2), and long-term after 1 year (T3). In total, 32 patients (mean age, 30.7 years; 23 women and 9 men) reached the study end point (T3); 24 patients were treated without botulinum toxin and 8 patients received preoperative injections of botulinum toxin. Results: Significant differences between both groups were observed, with a more stable result for the experimental group treated with botulinum toxin. Discussion: In a selective group of adult patients with a class II division II incisor relationship and with a class II skeletal base, botulinum toxin injections can effectively prevent relapse. This may present an alternative to a conventional myotomy. (C) 2016 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Materials and Methods: For 152 patients (189 calcaneal fractures; average followup, 9.9 years), all fractures were classified in accordance with the Essex-Lopresti, OTA, Regazzoni, and Sanders classifications and matched with the following scores: AOFAS score, CNHF, FOA, MFS, Rowe, MFA, SF-36, and VAS. Results: The Essex-Lopresti classification showed no statistically significant relation with any of the clinical scores (p > 0.05). The OTA classification related statistically significant with the MFS (p = 0.006), AOFAS score (p = 0.013), FOA (p = 0.019), Rowe (p = 0.0027), and MFA score (p = 0.03). The Regazzoni classification correlated with the AOFAS score (p = 0.003), MFS (p = 0.002), Rowe (P 0.002), CNHF (p = 0.0001), FOA (p = 0.003), MFA score (p 0.002), and VAS (p = 0.005). The Sanders classification correlated with the AOFAS score (p = 0.007), MFS (P = 0.001), Rowe (p = 0.001), CNHF (p = 0.024), FOA (p = 0.021), MFA score (p = 0.036), and VAS (p = 0.014). Conclusion: Compared to radiological based classifications, the CT based classifications, especially the Regazzoni Hod Sanders classifications, exhibited higher prognostic value compared to ultimate outcome scores.

Results: Four cats (mTR = 4) and five small breed dogs (mean weight 15 kg; TR = 4, mTR = 1) were included. Median time to postoperative weight bearing was one day. Median lameness score at six weeks postoperatively was 0 out of 5. Coxofemoral joint congruity was radiographically confirmed at the six weeks postoperative visit. Telephone follow-up (at a median of 16 weeks) revealed all animals had returned to their previous level of activity. Complications were minor, and limited to postoperative swelling (n = 1). Clinical significance: Clinical use of the Arthrex Mini TightRope (TM) and TightRope (TM) systems can be recommended for traumatic craniodorsal coxofemoral luxation in this novel application as short-term results are at least comparable to existing surgical techniques. Long-term follow-up studies are needed.

Firstly, BF/PLLA composites and pure PLLA were produced by the methods of solution blending and freeze drying. The results showed that basalt fibers can be uniformly dispersed in the PLLA matrix and significantly improve the mechanical properties and hydrophilicity of the PLLA matrix. The presence of basalt fibers may retard the polymer degradation rate and neutralize the acid degradation from PLLA. Osteoblasts were cultured in vitro to evaluate the cytocompatibility of the composite. An MTT assay revealed that osteoblasts proliferated well for 7 days and there was little difference found in their viability on both PLLA and BF/PLLA films, which was consistent with the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity results. A fluorescent staining observation showed that osteoblasts grew well on the composites. SEM images displayed that osteoblasts tended to grow along the fiber axis. The formation of mineralized nodules was observed on the films by Alizarin red S staining. These results suggest that the presence of basalt fibers does not noticeably affect osteoblastic behavior and the designed composites are osteoblast compatible. It is concluded that basalt fibers, as reinforcing fibers, may have promising applications in hard tissue repair.

Interpersonal Violence and Facial Fractures	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							MAXILLOFACIAL FRACTURES; CONCOMITANT INJURIES; MANDIBULAR FRACTURES; PATTERN; TRAUMA; AUSTRALIA; ETIOLOGY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ACCIDENTS; VICTIMS	Purpose: Interpersonal violence is a major health hazard that contributes to the high volume of trauma seen in the emergency department. It is also one of the principal causes of maxillofacial fractures. Materials and Methods: The present study was a retrospective analysis of patients referred to, and treated at, the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Unit at Christchurch Hospital during an 11-year period (1996 to 2006). The variables examined included patient demographics, fracture types, mode of injury, and treatment delivered. Results: An increase was found in the number of fractures due to interpersonal violence in the second half of the study, although the proportion remained the same. The age of the patients ranged from 9 to 89 years (mean 28). The male-to-female ratio was 9:1. Of the patients, 87% had alcohol involvement. The mandible was the most common site of fracture, followed by the zygoma. Other midface fractures, including Le Fort fractures, were less frequently observed. Of the patients, 59% were hospitalized and 56% required surgery, with internal fixation necessary in 41% of patients. Conclusion: An increase occurred in the number of facial fractures associated with interpersonal violence during the study period. Young male adults were the most affected demographic group, with alcohol a main contributing factor. Violence-related facial fracture is a health hazard that deserves more public awareness and implementation of preventive programs.

This study analyzed the behavior of the internal circumferential cracks located in the cement layer of the cement-prosthesis interface during the main phases of the gait cycle. The extended finite element method was used in determining the stress intensity factors to identify the crack behavior. An adverse relationship was found between the stress intensity factors and the distance from the distal end. Consequently, the maximum stress intensity factors were observed at the distal part, specifically at the corner of the cement mantle. Additionally, the highest values of K-I, K-II, and K-III were presented during the single leg stance and push off phases, whereas the swing phase showed the minimum stress intensity factors. In addition, K-I and K-III were identified to be the dominant stress intensity factors and were respectively enhanced along the proximal to the distal end by about 89.5% and 65.9% in the lateral side and 63.7% and 56.5% in the medial side. This finding indicates higher risks of cement mantle fracture and fatigue crack propagation at the distal area. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Oshkour, A. A.; Yau, Y.

We hypothesized that most conversion THA's can be performed using primary implants and will have an uncomplicated post-operative course. Materials and methods Thirty-six patients (23 females, mean age 68,0y) who underwent conversion THA for failed interventions for proximal femur fractures in the period 2008-2018 were matched sequentially against patients of the same sex and age who underwent primary THA or revision THA. Data were collected on implants used, major complications, and mortality. PROMs used included the Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index, Harris Hip Score, Visual Analogue Scale and the EQ-5D Health Questionnaire. Results Seventy-two percent of patients who underwent conversion THA were treated with primary implants and never suffered from a major complication. PROMs were excellent for this group of patients. The distinction primary/conversion/revision THA could not explain differences in outcomes; however, the necessity of using revision implants and the development of major complications could. Conclusions The majority of conversion total hip arthroplasties can be considered a primary replacement. Predicting outcomes for THA should focus on patient frailty and technical difficulties dealing with infection, stability and loss of bone stock and should discard the conversion versus revision terminology.

Surgical blood order equation in femoral fracture surgery	TRANSFUSION MEDICINE			English	Article						accurate; blood; ordering	TOTAL HIP; TRANSFUSION; ARTHROPLASTY; REQUIREMENTS; TRIAL	Aim: This study aimed at establishing the clinical utility of the surgical blood order equation (SBOE) in patients undergoing femoral fracture surgery. Background: A blood ordering schedule defines the perioperative blood use in elective surgery. It lists the number of units of blood required for each procedure preoperatively. Materials and methods: A case-control study was performed among homogeneous groups of patients (n = 62 each) undergoing open reduction and internal fixation of femoral fractures. Correct prediction of blood use in the group of patients using the SBOE was compared to the group whose blood orders were made without any guideline. Results: The surgical blood ordering equation was exactly correct in ordering blood for 46 (74 center dot 2%) of 62 patients (cases). The current unaided blood ordering method was exactly correct in ordering blood for 27 (43 center dot 5%) of 62 patients (controls). Use of the SBOE resulted in a significantly lower crossmatch-to-transfusion ratio compared to that of the current ordering system (1 center dot 5 vs 2 center dot 3) and saved the hospital transfusion laboratory 465 US$ of crossmatch and inventory management costs in this cohort of patients. Conclusion: The SBOE is a more accurate and cost-saving tool in predicting blood use. It should replace the current unaided method of ordering for perioperative blood in femoral fracture surgery at Mulago Hospital. However, its introduction to other hospitals should be preceded by more rigorous research to strengthen its external validity.

Two muscles are involved in the genesis of such non-unions, the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus. Literature says that, during hip flexion, their terminal insertions on the faces of the GT generate an anterior translation of the GT responsible for contact loosening and healing defect. The main goal of this paper was to assess this hypothesis into the 3D space and to quantify the 3D displacements (three translations and three rotations) of the GT after trochanterotomy during passive motions of the hip joint (flexion, abduction-adduction, internal and external rotation). Therefore, we used 13 fresh cadaveric hips, on which we registered the GT displacements thanks to a 3D infrared localizer. An ultra low weight dynamic reference based has been developed to track the motion of the GT without any interference. The results have shown rotatory displacements of the GT around the three axes. This produces a posterior and lateral opening of the osteotomy site associated with a posterior rotatory shear of the GT. Above 45 degrees of hip flexion these three rotations combine together to exert shear on the osteotomy site which is harmful to the osteosynthesis material and the consolidation potential and may explain implant loosening.

Materials and Methods: Four beagle dogs were enrolled and euthanized at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks post-operatively for immunohistochemical analysis using 6 specific antibodies (bone morphogenetic protein [BMP]-2/4, BMP-7, TGF-beta 2, TGF-beta 3, matrix metalloproteinase-3, and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]). The results from the surgical site and control (adjacent area) were compared. Results: Generalized upregulation of BMP-2/4 was observed in all healing periods, and the strongest expression of BMP-7 was observed at 1 week postoperatively. The strongest expression of TGF-beta 2 was observed at 8 weeks with increasing pattern. The strong expression of TGF-beta 3 was observed at 1 and 4 weeks, with the strongest expression of VEGF at 1 week, with a decreasing pattern. No notable uptake was detected with the 6 specific antibodies in the adjacent bone (control). Conclusions: The absence of internal fixation after VRO led to dynamic healing with a specific expression pattern of BMP-7 and TGF-beta 2. The anatomic factors, including sufficient preexisting vascularity, led to the earlier expression pattern of VEGF.

Methods: Four eccentric guides, four large dynamic compression plates (L-DCP) from four local manufacturers, and a Vander 200 mm caliper brand were used. Five standard parameter measurements were created for the set eccentric guide-plate, which were identified as A to E. Four sets were made, using materials of the same factory, and identified as groups I to IV. The analyses were performed by measuring all the parameters from a ventral view of the plate, with the eccentric guide placed in the plate hole. Results: Groups I and II showed the same values for all the parameters. All the groups showed the same measurements for E = 8.15 e B = 3.60, Group III: A = 8.10mm, C = 3.25mm, D = 1.25mm. Group IV: A = 7.00mm, C = 3.10mm, D = 0.30mm. Maximum compression force was (F Max.): Group I 80.58 N, Group. II: F Max. 81.63 N, Group. Ill: F Max. 36.32N, Group. IV: F Max. 37.52N Conclusion: The measurements evaluated show a lack of standardization in the manufacture of orthopedic instruments and its effects on the values for compression strength.

J	Lachmann, S; Engel, EM; Axmann, D; Weber, H				Lachmann, S; Engel, EM; Axmann, D; Weber, H			Radiographic study of changes in the mandibular condyle after implant prosthodontic rehabilitation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROSTHODONTICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the German-Prosthodontic-Association	MAY 15-17, 2003	Rust, GERMANY	German Prosthodont Assoc			RADIOLOGIC FOLLOW-UP; TEMPOROMANDIBULAR-JOINT; INTERNAL DERANGEMENT; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; TMJ-PAIN; FRACTURES; DYSFUNCTION; RESORPTION; OCCLUSAL; FIXATION	Purpose: The aim of this follow-up investigation was to assess the influence of clinical variables after implant prosthodontic rehabilitation in patients without temporomandibular disorders on alterations of condylar morphology as seen radiographically. Materials and Methods: In 167 patients, the condylar findings of flattening, erosion, osteophytes, and sclerosis were scored according to severity on rotational panoramic radiographs. Findings were followed up on images taken before and on average 5 years after implant prosthodontic rehabilitation. Changes were analyzed in relation to age, gender, initial radiologic status, and occlusal support pre- and posttreatment, according to Eichner groups, by logistic regression analysis. Results: The majority of patients did not show structural alterations over the follow-up period, regardless of whether the condyle was already affected at the outset of the investigation. Condyles unaffected at the time of the first radiograph made up the majority of increases in radiographic score. Flattening and sclerosis were cumulative, whereas erosions and osteophytes had a more transient character. There was no influence of the mentioned clinical or radiographic findings on the development of changes. Conclusion: Over the investigated period, the incidence of all four noted findings doubled. However, the statistical methods employed could not detect any influence of patient variables or the insertion of implant-retained prosthodontics on the development of condylar changes in this specific patient group. Both assertions reflect the complexity of the topic.

PLLA oriented in melt state was brittle and their mechanical strength was not high, whereas PPDO fiber appeared high mechanical strength and flexibility. PPDO fiber reinforced PLLA composite can provide good mechanical performance for long hydrolysis time. The initial interfacial shear strength (IFSS) and microfailure modes of bioabsorbable composites are very important factors because IFSS changes with hydrolytic degradation. The degree of degradation for PPDO fiber and PLLA matrix was measured by thermal analysis and optical observation. IFSS and work of adhesion, W-a between PPDO fiber and PLLA matrix showed the maximum at the plasma treatment time, at 60 s. Work of adhesion was lineally proportional to the IFSS. PPDO fiber showed ductile microfailure modes at the initial state, whereas brittle microfailure modes appeared with elapsing hydrolysis time. With increasing hydrolysis time, the distribution of AE amplitude became narrow and AE energy decreased gradually due to the deteriorated fiber fracture energy. The results of nondestructive AE were reasonably consistent with the trend of microfailure modes by optical fragmentation method. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Distal radius fracture; Volar locking plates; ORIF; Anatomical reconstruction; CT; Biomechanics	FRACTURES; ANGLE	Background: Fractures of the distal radius are common, with volar locking plates being increasingly used in their treatment. They aim to provide stable internal fixation and are designed to mirror the natural anatomy. Current volar plate designs incorporate a volar cortical angle (VCA) of 25 degrees. Hypothesis: The aim of this study is to determine whether the VCA in uninjured distal radii corresponds accurately with modern volar plate designs. Materials and Methods: A retrospective radiological analysis utilizing Computed Tomography scans to assess the VCA of 100 distal radii. Each distal radius was subjected to 3 measurements of the VCA in the sagittal plane. Results: One hundred patients were identified (67 male, 33 female; mean age 37.4 years). The mean VCA was 32.9 degrees (S.D.+/- 5.14 degrees). The VCA in male patients was significantly greater than in females( 33.6 vs 31.5 degrees; P = 0.04). There was a statistically significant difference between the lateral VCA and medial VCA (32.2 vs 34.3 degrees, P = 0.02). Discussion: Our study clearly demonstrates that the VCA measured in the distal radius is significantly greater than the volar angulation incorporated within modern plate design. Given that the aim of ORIF is to anatomically reconstruct the distal radius, our study highlights that this may not be possible with current plattes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The aim of this study was to analyze the demographics, causes, characteristics, and outcomes of zygomatic fractures managed at several European departments of oral and maxillofacial surgery. Materials and methods: This study is based on a multicenter systematic database that allowed the recording of all patients with ZMC fractures between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2017. The following data were recorded: gender, age, personal medical history, etiology, side of zygomatic fracture, classification of ZMC fracture, associated maxillofacial fractures, symptoms at diagnosis, type of performed treatment, and sequelae/complications. Results: A total of 1406 patients (1172 males, 234 females) were included in the study. Statistically significant correlations were found between assault-related ZMC fractures and the A3 class (p < .0000005) and between Infraorbital Nerve (ION) anesthesia and B class (p < .00000005). Conclusion: The most frequent cause of ZMC fractures was assault, followed by falls. The most frequently involved decade of age was between 20 and 29 years. The decision and type of surgical treatment of ZMC fractures depends on several issues that need to be considered on a case by case basis.

Percutaneous Tibial Fracture Reduction Using Computed Tomography Imaging, Computer Modelling and 3D Printed Alignment Constructs: A Cadaveric Study	VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ORTHOPAEDICS AND TRAUMATOLOGY			English	Article						tibia; three-dimensional printing; fracture alignment; canine; minimally invasive osteosynthesis	INVASIVE PLATE OSTEOSYNTHESIS; LONG-BONE FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; RADIOGRAPHIC MEASUREMENT; PROXIMAL TIBIA; ULNA FRACTURES; REPAIR; DOGS; DEFORMITIES; EVOLUTION	Objective The main aim of this study was to evaluate a percutaneous method of bone alignment using a diaphyseal tibial fracture model. Materials and Methods Mid-shaft diaphyseal fractures were created in 12 large-breed canine tibiae. Interaction pins were inserted into the proximal and distal bone segments. Computed tomography scans of the fractured tibiae and pins were imported into three-dimensional (3D) modelling software and the fractures were virtually reduced. A multi-component 3D printed alignment jig was created that encompassed the pins in their aligned configuration. Orthogonal radiographs were taken after alignment jig application. Intact and post-alignment tibial lengths and joint angles were compared. Rotational alignment was subjectively evaluated. Results Post-alignment tibial lengths differed on the mediolateral and craniocaudal radiographs by an average of 1.55 and 1.43% respectively. Post-alignment mechanical medial proximal tibial angle, mechanical medial distal tibial angle and mechanical caudal proximal tibial angle had an average difference of 1.67 degrees, 1.92 degrees and 2.17 degrees respectively. Differences in tibial length and joint angles were not significant (p > 0.05). Clinical Significance While in vivo evaluation is necessary, this technique to align diaphyseal fractures percutaneously using computer modelling and 3D printing is technically feasible and may facilitate the clinical use of minimally invasive osteosynthesis techniques.

Experimental samples were implanted into the lateral femoral condyles of 66 New Zealand rabbits, allocated into the following groups: non-porous prosthesis group (Group A, n=22); HPTP group (Group B, n=22); HPTP+CBM group (Group C, n=22). The rabbits were sacrificed at 3, 8 and 12 weeks, postoperatively. X-ray analyses, microscopy techniques and morphological measurement software and mechanical tests were used for evaluation. At each time point, the tissues surrounding the implants were similar in all of the groups, with bony in-growth into the 2-mm round holes observed for the defects in Groups B and C. However, the internal bone formation was significantly better in Group C than in Group B at different time points (P < 0.01). Biomechanically, the pull-out forces were significantly greater in Groups B and C than in Group A (P < 0.01), with no difference between Groups B and C (P > 0.05). These results suggest that bone can grow into the cavities of HPTP to achieve more stable locking fixation, and those osteogenic materials, such as CBM, can enhance osteogenesis to achieve better osseointegration between the implant and the host bone.

Materials and methods: Anatomical femoral and tibial cartilage constructs, fabricated by three-dimensional fibre deposition (3DF) or compression moulding/particulate leaching (CM), were evaluated in vitro and in vivo in an autologous rabbit model. Effects of scaffold pore architecture on rabbit chondrocyte differentiation and mechanical properties were evaluated following in vitro culture and subcutaneous implantation in nude mice. After femoral and tibial osteotomy and autologous implantation of tissue-engineered constructs in rabbit knee joints, implant fixation and joint articulation were evaluated. Results: Rapid prototyping of 3DF architectures with 100% interconnecting pores promoted homogeneous distribution of viable cells, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen type II; significantly greater GAG content and differentiation capacity (GAG/DNA) in vitro compared to CM architectures; and higher mechanical equilibrium modulus and dynamic stiffness (at 0.1 Hz). Six weeks after implantation, femoral and tibial constructs had integrated with rabbit bone and knee flexion/extension and partial load bearing were regained. Histology demonstrated articulating surfaces between femoral and tibial constructs for CM and 3DF architectures; however, repair tissue appeared fibrocartilage-like and did not resemble implanted cartilage. Conclusions: Anatomically shaped, tissue-engineered constructs with designed mechanical properties and internal pore architectures may offer alternatives for reconstruction or restoration of congruent articulating surfaces in small joints.

Patient concerns: The patient was admitted to a rehabilitation specialty hospital approximately 1 year post a fracture of the distal left tibiofibula and separate surgical tibiofibular fracture incision and internal fixation + bone grafting. Diagnoses: Clinical presentation included the left ankle incision was interrupted for about 3 cm with poor healing, a small amount of muscle necrosis, fat liquefaction, a large amount of yellow purulent secretion overflow and necrotic material was seen in the local wound. Interventions: Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) gel was injected into the wounds and submerged sites to make full contact with the wounds and close the wounds with the autologous platelet-rich fibrin prepared by mixing, and then covered with oil gauze to keep the wounds moist and promote granulation growth. The outermost layer was covered with cotton pads. Outcomes: After 30 days of 2 PRF treatments, the skin defect was healed and no significant abnormality was observed at 6 months follow-up.

Generally, posterior fragments of these fractures could not be exposed and reduced well in conventional anterior approaches. Although a posterolateral/posteromedial approach to manage posterior tibial plateau fractures can achieve satisfactory results, there are few presentations concerning the treatment of these high-energy injuries based on posterior approaches combined with anterior approach if necessary. Materials and Methods: Ten cases of posterior tibial plateau fractures from high-energy injuries were retrospectively reviewed and followed up for mean 26.5 months (range 14-45 months). A posterolateral/posteromedial approach was adopted primarily to fix main fragment in posterior tibial plateau, and intraoperative assessment of the stability of knee was done. An anterior approach was added if required. Results: Posterolateral approach was employed in seven cases, posteromedial in three, and additional anteromedial in three, and anterolateral in two cases. The average time to union of all 10 fractures was 3.7 months (range 3-5.5 months). Nine patients had satisfactory articular reduction. The range of motion of the knee averaged 2 degrees of extension to 110.5 degrees of flexion. No patient complained of knee instability. The average postoperative HSS score at the final followup was 92.70. Conclusions: High-energy fractures of posterior tibial plateau could be well treated based on posterior approaches combined with necessary anterior approach if required.

Materials and Methods: Sixty-four patients who underwent bimaxillary surgery with mandibular advancement fixed with the HT were selected from 2 different institutions and enrolled in this retrospective study. All patients underwent CBCT preoperatively, 1 month after surgery, and 12 months after surgery. To estimate the long-term stability of the HT, volumetric comparisons were performed using the following measurements: distance between the gonion and the B point in the sagittal plane; distance between the right and left gonion transversally; and the angle of the line connecting the mandibular notch and the gonion and the line connecting the gonion and the B point vertically. Results: Statistical analysis showed no relevant relapse (< 1 mm or < 1 degrees) when using the HT. However, a positive correlation between the amount of advancement and the amount of postoperative relapse was observed. Conclusion: The HT produces stable postoperative 3D results after 12 months.

Novel synthesis and characterization of a collagen-based biopolymer initiated by hydroxyapatite nanoparticles	ACTA BIOMATERIALIA			English	Article						Biodegradable polymer; Collagen; PLGA; Hydroxyapatite	HYDROXYLAPATITE POLY(L-LACTIDE) COMPOSITES; LACTIDE-CO-GLYCOLIDE; CREST BONE-GRAFT; BIORESORBABLE DEVICES; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; FORGED COMPOSITES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; HA PARTICLES; IN-VIVO; SURFACE	In this study, we developed a novel synthesis method to create a complex collagen-based biopolymer that promises to possess the necessary material properties for a bone graft substitute. The synthesis was carried out in several steps. In the first step, a ring-opening polymerization reaction initiated by hydroxyapatite nanoparticles was used to polymerize D,L-lactide and glycolide monomers to form poly(lactide-co-glycolide) co-polymer. In the second step, the polymerization product was coupled with succinic anhydride, and subsequently was reacted with N-hydroxysuccinimide in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide as the cross-linking agent, in order to activate the co-polymer for collagen attachment. In the third and final step, the activated co-polymer was attached to calf skin collagen type I, in hydrochloric acid/phosphate buffer solution and the precipitated co-polymer with attached collagen was isolated. The synthesis was monitored by proton nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared and Raman spectroscopies, and the products after each step were characterized by thermal and mechanical analysis. Calculations of the relative amounts of the various components, coupled with initial dynamic mechanical analysis testing of the resulting biopolymer, afforded a preliminary assessment of the structure of the complex biomaterial formed by this novel polymerization process.

It is related to the stability of fracture reduction. We describe the application of a trochanter supporting plate (TSP) to restore the fracture stability after early cut-out of a lag screw in unstable intertrochanteric fractures. Materials and methods: A total of 11 consecutive patients with superior cut-out of the lag screw of a dynamic hip screw (DHS) or a gamma nail in an unstable intertrochanteric fracture occurring within 6 months after surgery were included in the present study. They underwent repeat surgery for placement of a DHS and a laterally mounted TSP of our design. All patients were monitored for at least 6 months (median 15 months; range 6-28 months). Results: There was no repeated cut-out of a lag screw, and 10 patients (91%) achieved bony union within 5 months. At the last follow-up, all patients could walk with or without aids. Conclusion: It reveals that a TSP, as an adjuvant to a lag screw placed inferiorly, is an easy and safe solution for the treatment of early cut-out of a lag screw in unstable intertrochanteric fractures.

BP-X exhibits stronger visible light absorption (400-800 nm) than that of PCN-222, while retaining the mesoporous nature with a surface area of similar to 650 m(2) g(-1) and large pore volume similar to 15 angstrom in diameter. A set of characterization measurements reveal the formation of an internal interface electric field in the composite and the electron transfer from BiOI to PCN-222. In addition, their photocatalytic activity toward the degradation of tetracycline (TC) under visible light irradiation is investigated to illustrate the advantages of self-decontaminating photocatalysts capable of both adsorption and photodegradation. BP-X shows superior TC adsorption and photodegradation activity. Specially, the photodegradation kinetic rate constant k of BP-3 is 1.5 and 10 times higher than that of PCN-222 and BiOI, respectively. The improved photocatalytic performance of BP-3 is attributed to its strong TC adsorption capacity and highly dispersed Z-scheme heterojunction, which is beneficial to photogenerated charge separation and electron transfer. This work explored the opportunities to develop heterojunction mesoporous materials based on MOFs for self-purification and photodegradation of organic pollutants.

In addition, materials previously limited to the 3D printing (3DP) process due to their own characteristics can also be used well in indirect 3DP. In this study, customised beta-TCP/chitosan scaffolds with the shape of rabbit radial head were produced by indirect 3D printing technology. Methods: Swelling ability, porosity, mechanical characterisation, and degradation rate analysis were performed, and in vitro studies were also implemented to evaluate the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the scaffolds. CCK8 cell proliferation assay kit and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining solution were used to study cell proliferation and early ALP content at the scaffold surface. Moreover, the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs on scaffolds was also evaluated through the scanning electron microscopy analysis. Results: beta-TCP/chitosan scaffold has good performance and degradation rate, and in vitro cell experiments also confirm that the scaffold has adequate cytocompatibility and bioactivity. Conclusion: This study provides a promising new strategy for the design of customised scaffolds for the repair of complex damaged tissues.

The present article aimed to introduce this technique and compare the clinical effects between the FMWSI technique and conventional incision (CI) for hip arthroplasty in elderly patients. Material/Methods: This study included 240 consecutive patients who underwent hip arthroplasty. Half received total hip arthroplasty and half received hemi hip arthroplasty. The 120 patients in each group were further divided into FMWSI and CI groups. The following parameters were compared between the FMWSI and CI groups: length of incision, operation time, bleeding volume, drainage volume, postoperative ambulation time, and Harris score. Results: Compared with the CI group, the FMWSI group had a significantly shorter incision length, operation time, and postoperative ambulation time, as well as lower bleeding and drainage volumes, irrespective of whether the treatment was total or hemi hip arthroplasty (P<0.05). However, no significant difference was found in the Harris score between the FMWSI and CI groups (P>0.05). Conclusions: The novel FMWSI technique introduced in this study is a useful method for hip arthroplasty, especially for elderly patients with poor constitutions or tolerance to surgery.

The aim of this study was to examine clinical and radiographic healing after rhBMP-2 application in children and adolescents presenting with nonunion of the femur and to investigate the safety of rhBMP-2 use in these cases. Materials and Methods. We reviewed the medical records of five patients with a mean age of 11 years (5.4 to 16.2) with nonunion of the femur who were treated with rhBMP-2 and internal fixation using a locking plate at a single institution. Particular attention was paid to identify all adverse events that may be due to rhBMP-2 use. Results. Union occurred in four of five patients at a mean of 12.1 months (7.9 to 18.9). The locking plates were removed after a mean of 16 months (11 to 23). One patient had nonunion due to deep infection. After a mean follow-up of 62.5 months (17 to 100), union was still evident in all four patients and they were fully weight-bearing without pain. Discussion. In this retrospective study, rhBMP-2 combined with a locking plate has been used successfully to treat children and adolescents with nonunion of the femur in four of five cases. One major complication was thought to be possibly related to its use.

Material and methods: Seventy-two patients admitted between 2000 and 2005 were followed up for a maximum 11 years (mean, 6.8 years): 16 females, 56 males; mean age at injury, 41.6 years (median, 40 years). There were 45 simple acetabular fractures, 27 complex fractures and 27 dislocations. Late complications were: osteoarthritis (n = 29), osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH: n = 8) and heterotopic ossification (n = 2). Results and discussion: Twenty-five total hip arthroplasties (THA) were performed, with a mean time to surgery of 3.7 years. Associated factors for THA were: VAS (P < 0.0001), PMA (P < 0.0001), osteoarthritis (P < 0.0001), ONFH (P < 0.0002), initial dislocation (P = 0.0002), no functional treatment (P = 0.0014), surgical treatment (P = 0.0065), initial traction (P = 0.0068), anterior and posterior congruency defect (P = 0.0072 and P < 0.0001), and initial intra-articular foreign body (P = 0.045). Factors associated with poor or bad functional results were the same, plus: etiology (P = 0.0021), BMI (P = 0.03) and posterior wall fracture (P = 0.0325).

J	Wu, CC; Tai, CL				Wu, Chi-Chuan; Tai, Ching-Lung			Plating treatment for tibial plateau fractures:: a biomechanical comparison of buttress and tension band <i>positions</i>	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						tibial plateau fracture; buttress position; tension band position	INTERNAL-FIXATION; STABILITY; ALIGNMENT; MOTION; STEMS; KNEE	The load tolerance of conventional plate treatment for bicondylar tibial plateau fractures with the buttress and the tension band positions was compared from biomechanical viewpoints. Fourteen left synthetic tibiae divided into two groups were tested. T-plates in the buttress group were placed on the medial tibial subcondyle and T-plates in the tension band group were placed on the lateral tibial subcondyle. All specimens were evaluated with a Material Testing System (MTS) machine. A linear variance displacement transducer gauge was placed on the medial tibial subcondyle. The anatomic axis of the synthetic femur and the tibia was maintained at 6 degrees varus in the frontal plane. The MTS actuator was set to increase displacement at 3 mm/min. All specimens were evaluated to failure. The relative motion and the ultimate failure load (UFL) between both groups were compared. The buttress group had significantly less displacement than the tension band group following the incrementally increased loading (p < 0.001). At failure, the buttress group also had a higher UFL (p < 0.001) and less displacement (p = 0.009) than the tension band group. All medial tibial condylar fragments achieved improved stabilization from the medial aspect of the proximal tibia by conventional plates. When conventional plates cannot be placed medially due to skin ailments, lateral placement of conventional plates may have the insufficient stability. Protected weight bearing should be followed strictly.

For the first time, the biocompatibility and osteointegration of PPy coating, incorporated with chondroitin sulfate (CS), were studied in vivo by implanting PPy-coated bioabsorbable bone fixation composite screws of poly-(lactide/glycolide) copolymer (PLGA) and beta-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) into New Zealand white rabbits. Uncoated bioabsorbable polymer composite screws and commercially available stainless steel cortical screws were used as reference implants. The rabbits were euthanized 12 and 26 weeks after the implantation. The systemic effects were evaluated from food and water consumption, body weight, body temperature, clinical signs, blood samples, internal organ weights, and histological examination. Local effects were studied from bone tissue and surrounding soft tissue histology. New bone formation was evaluated by micro-computed tomography, tetracycline labeling and torsion tests. Torsion tests were performed in order to capture the peak value of the torsion force during the course of the screw's loosening. he coated screws induced significantly more bone formation than the uncoated screws. In addition, none of the implants induced any systemic or local toxicity. The results suggest that PPy is biocompatible with bone tissue and is a potential coating for enhancing osteointegration in orthopedic implants.

Herein, we investigate the use of CO2 for the synthesis of organic cyclic carbonates on metal-free nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts obtained from chitosan, chitin, and shrimp shell wastes, both in batch and in continuous flow (CF). The catalysts were characterized by N-2 physisorption, CO2-temperature-programmed desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and CNHS elemental analysis, and all reactivity tests were run in the absence of solvents. Under batch conditions, the catalyst obtained by calcination of chitin exhibited excellent performance in the conversion of epichlorohydrin (selected as a model epoxide), resulting in the corresponding cyclic carbonate with 96% selectivity at complete conversion, at 150 degrees C and 30 bar CO2, for 4 h. On the other hand, in a CF regime, a quantitative conversion and a carbonate selectivity >99% were achieved at 150 degrees C, by using the catalyst obtained from shrimp waste. Remarkably, the material displayed an outstanding stability over a reaction run time of 180 min. The robustness of the synthetized catalysts was confirmed by their good operational stability and reusability: ca. (75 +/- 3)% of the initial conversion was achieved/retained by all systems, after six recycles. Also, additional batch experiments proved that the catalysts were successful on different terminal and internal epoxides.

An alternative technique for greater tuberosity fractures: use of the mesh plate	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Greater tuberosity; Proximal humerus; Mesh plate	PROXIMAL HUMERUS; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION	Introduction Isolated greater tuberosity (GT) fractures (AO 11-A1) tend to occur in the younger patient population and are poorly managed by most precontoured proximal humerus locking plates. The goal of this study was to identify and assess an alternative treatment strategy for greater tuberosity fractures. Materials and methods A retrospective review of all cases of isolated greater tuberosity fractures treated with a 2.4/2.7 mesh plate (Synthes) between 2010 and 2015 was conducted. Patient demographics, operative reports, and clinical notes were reviewed. The time to radiographic union was assessed. Clinical outcomes were retrieved from patients at their follow-up visits or via mailed Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, Hand (DASH) questionnaires. Results Ten patients with isolated GT fractures treated with mesh plating were identified with an average age of 47.1 years. The average radiographic follow-up was 7.2 months and the average clinical follow-up was 8.0 months. The mean time to union was 8.5 weeks. Two patients underwent elective hardware removal. The mean DASH at final follow-up was 28.2 (+/- 22.4), while the mean DASH work was 13.6 (+/- 19.1). Conclusion We have identified a viable alternative treatment option for the surgical management of isolated greater tuberosity fractures using a mesh plate that can be contoured to the patient's anatomy. Surgeons should be aware of this option for select patients.

Infected non-union of the Humerus after Failure of Surgical Treatment: Management using the Orthofix External Fixator	ANNALS ACADEMY OF MEDICINE SINGAPORE			English	Article						Bone graft; Fracture humers; Non-united fractures	ILIZAROV TECHNIQUE; SEGMENTAL DEFECTS; UPPER EXTREMITY; BONE-GRAFTS; NON-UNIONS; FRACTURES; SHAFT; RECONSTRUCTION; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; COMPLICATIONS	Introduction: The failure of a humeral fracture to unite after surgical treatment may be due to many factors. When there are additional complications of infection, treatment by conventional methods of internal fixation becomes very difficult. Materials and Methods: We treated 8 infected non-union of diaphyseal fracture of the humerus by the Orthofix external fixator. All had previous surgical treatment. Non-union followed plating in 6 cases and in 2 cases after the external fixator. All patients had pain, at least one sinus discharging pus and severe functional impairment of the affected arm. There were 6 men and 2 women with a mean age 40.6 years. Results: Bone union was achieved in all cases. The mean time to union was 4.5 months (range, 2 to 8). Patients expressed high levels of satisfaction with the outcome, despite relatively modest improvement in pain and function, mainly because of long standing infection and intractable non-union. There were no major pin tract problems requiring the removal of the Schanz screws. Radial nerve palsy developed in I patient who recovered spontaneously. No patient required an additional bone grafting procedure. Conclusion: The use of the Orthofix external fixator without bone grafting was successful in the treatment of infected non-union of the humeral shaft. It shortened the duration of hospitalisation and immobilisation with moderate functional recovery.

A finite element model of a human fractured tibia was constructed in ABAQUS 6.10, and the bone fragments were assembled with a bone plate and screws. Four design parameters of a composite bone plate were studied to investigate their influence on bone fracture healing. The Taguchi method with the design of experiments (DOE) was used for optimal design of the bone plate. Three levels of each design parameter were determined, and a standard orthogonal array L-9 (3(4)) was constructed to perform the simulations according to the table array. To optimize the design parameters of the bone plate and maximize the healing performance, signal-to-noise ratio was used, as a larger signal-to-noise ratio was better. The optimum levels of design parameters of the bone plate were selected, and the optimal design of a bone plate was suggested to maximize the healing performance. The optimal condition of design parameters was successfully determined by using the Taguchi method, and it was shown to maximize the healing of bone fractures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

After drilling through the plate and tapping, a biodegradable screw can be inserted, followed by removal of the screw head. As an alternative a countersink screw can be used. Aim of the study was to compare the mechanical properties of the 1.4 mm Free Form Plate with the 2.0 mm conventional shaped plate. Mechanical testing of the plate pull-out strength was conducted for the Inion (R) Free Form Plate fixed with an Inion OTPS (TM) 2.0 x 20 mm Screw. In addition, the failure mode was reported. Overlapping confidence levels were found with regard to the yield load, first peak load and maximum load, when comparing the Free Form Plate and the conventional 4-hole plate. The Free Form Plate fixed with a screw with head and countersink showed the highest stability at maximum load. The results of the mechanical stability testing showed no significant differences between the tested plates. The main failure mode was a failure of the screw shaft. The results of the current investigation imply that the 1.4 mm Free Form Plate could be used as an alternative to the 2.0 mm conventional shaped plate.

Despite the use of new techniques and new materials, we can still observe certain side effects, including the immune reaction of the body, which may lead to the excessive inflammation. The aim of this paper was to determine how the production of prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) and thromboxane B-2 (TXB2) in THP-1 monocytes/macrophages is influenced by the titanium 3D plates and dedicated screws. The experiments were conducted on THP-1 monocytic cell line and macrophages derived from a THP-1cells. The concentrations of PGE(2) and TXB2 released were measured by using immunoassay kit. Verification of plate-induced activation of THP-1 monocytes and macrophages and initiation of inflammatory reaction was conducted by flow cytometry. Despite some differences in the content of the implant devices our results showed that these plates did not statistically significantly increase the production of these prostanoids. Osteosynthesis of condylar fractures using 3D titanium mini-plates seems to be a good alternative to traditional plates due to their lack of stimulating the cyclooxygenase-dependent production of prostanoids; limiting the development of inflammatory reactions.

In this work, a dense and nanoscale magnesium fluoride (MgF2) coating was deposited on the surface of Mg-Zn-Zr (MZZ) alloy cancellous screw. The MZZ cancellous screw with MgF2 coating maintained an integrated shape and high yield tensile stress after 30 days immersion in SBF, comparing with the bare screw. Hydrogen releasing rate of the MZZ samples was suppressed at a lower level at the initial stage, which is in favour of the adhesion of the cells. And in vivo experiments indicated that MgF2-coated MZZ screws presented advantages in cytocompatibility, osteoconductivity and osteogenesis of cancellous bone in rabbits. Corrosion rate in vivo perfusion environment increased very slowly with time in long-term study, which was an opposite trend in vitro static immersion test Moreover, maximum corrosion rate (CRmax), a critical calculation method of corrosion rate was introduced to predict fracture regions of the sample. The MZZ alloy with MgF2 coating possesses a great potential for clinical applications for internal fracture fixation repair. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Larsson, S				Larsson, Sune			Calcium Phosphates: What Is the Evidence?	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC TRAUMA			English	Article						calcium phosphate; cement; augmentation; surgery; osteoporosis; fractures	BETA-TRICALCIUM PHOSPHATE; DISTAL RADIAL FRACTURES; FEMORAL-NECK FRACTURES; BONE-CEMENT; INTERNAL-FIXATION; TIBIAL PLATEAU; HISTOLOGICAL-EVALUATION; FIBER REINFORCEMENT; NORIAN SRS; IN-VIVO	A number of different calcium phosphate compounds such as calcium phosphate cements and solid beta-tricalcium phosphate products have been introduced during the last decade. The chemical composition mimics the mineral phase of bone and as a result of this likeness, the materials seem to be remodeled as for normal bone through a cell-mediated process that involves osteoclastic activity. This is a major difference when compared with, for instance, calcium sulphate compounds that after implantation dissolve irrespective of the new bone formation rate. Calcium phosphates are highly biocompatible and in addition, they act as synthetic osteoconductive scaffolds after implantation in bone. When placed adjacent to bone, osteoid is formed directly on the surface of the calcium phosphate with no soft tissue interposed. Remodeling is slow and incomplete, but by adding more and larger pores, like in ultraporous beta-tricalcium phosphate, complete or nearly complete resorption can be achieved. The indications explored so far include filling of metaphyseal fracture voids or bone cysts, a volume expander in conjunction with inductive products, and as a carrier for various growth factors and antibiotics. Calcium phosphate compounds such as calcium phosphate cement and beta-tricalcium phosphate will most certainly be part of the future armamentarium when dealing with fracture treatment. It is reasonable to believe that we have so far only seen the beginning when it comes to clinical applications.

Materials and methods: We identified 291 consecutive skeletally mature patients with 296 radial head fractures treated during a 6-year period. Of these, 121 consecutive fractures of part of the radial head displaced greater than 2 mm (type 2) were classified according to whether there was complete lack of cortical contact between a fracture fragment and the rest of the proximal radius. Predictors of isolated vs complex injury pattern were sought in bivariate and multivariable analyses. Results: Of 121 fractures, 30 (25%) were classified as having cortical contact, and 91 (75%) were classified as not having cortical contact. Ten (33%) with cortical contact were part of a complex elbow injury, and 83 of 91 fractures (91%) without cortical contact were part of a complex elbow injury (P<.01). Among the Mason type 2 fractures, loss of cortical contact was a significant predictor of a complex elbow injury in both bivariate and multivariable analyses, with an odds ratio of 21 (95% confidence interval, 7-59). Conclusions: Among Mason type 2 fractures, complete loss of cortical contact of at least one fracture fragment is strongly predictive of a complex injury pattern.

Setting: Biomechanics laboratory at a Level I trauma center. Patients/Participants: Eight pairs (4 male and 4 female) of elderly (average age, 79 years; range, 63 to 104 years) cadaveric tibiae. Intervention: Osteotomies were performed in the proximal tibia to reproduce a 41-C2 bicondylar fracture pattern. The 4.5-mm proximal tibial periarticular locking plates (Smith-Nephew, Memphis, TN) were applied to the tibiae with 4 proximal bicortical or unicortical locking screws and 3 screws distal to the fracture site. The fixed tibiae were tested by using a materials testing machine (Instron, Canton, MA) with the axial load on the media] condyle. Outcome Measurements: The bicortical and unicortical constructs were compared for stiffness, yield load and displacement, and maximum load and displacement to failure. Results: Bicortical screw placement significantly outperformed unicortical screw placement in stiffness (53.1 +/- 6.7 N/mm versus 35.6 +/- 7.2 N/mm, P < 0.002) and maximum load (476.5 +/- 83.8 N versus 258.9 +/- 62.1 N, P < 0.001) but the yield properties and the ultimate displacement were not significantly different. Conclusion: Bicortical screw placement may provide a biomechanically superior construct than unicortical screw placement for the stabilization of unstable proximal tibia fractures.

J	Jeong, BO; Chung, DW; Baek, JH				Jeong, Bi O.; Chung, Duke Whan; Baek, Jong Hun			Management of calcific myonecrosis with a sinus tract A case report	MEDICINE			English	Article						calcific myonecrosis; compartment syndrome; dystrophic calcification; surgical treatment	COMPARTMENT SYNDROME; LATE SEQUELA; LEG	Rationale: Calcific myonecrosis is a very rare late sequela that occurs in patients who have had trauma accompanied by vascular compromise, in which a single muscle or entire muscles in a compartment undergoes necrosis and form a calcified mass. It is mostly a benign entity, but some cases cause bone destruction and form non-healing chronic sinuses. In such cases, wound management becomes difficult and there is a potential risk of secondary infection. Patient concerns: A 60-year-old male was referred for evaluation of a pain, erythematous changes, and draining sinus of the anterolateral aspect of his left leg. He had an open reduction and internal fixation as well as a stent insertion in the femoral artery owing to a distal femur fracture and femoral artery rupture. Diagnoses: A thick fluid with a chalk-like material was discharged through the shiny skin via the sinus. The radiographs of the left leg showed a large, fusiform-shaped, radiopaque soft tissue mass in the space between the tibia and fibula. We performed an incisional biopsy to differentiated soft tissue sarcoma and malignant cells were found. Pathologic evaluation revealed acute and chronic inflammation with dystrophic calcification. These findings led to the diagnosis of calcific myonecrosis. Interventions: We performed an extensive debridement of the anterior and deep posterior compartments to ensure definitive treatment. Upon performing extensive debridement, we inserted a drain tube and performed primary closure. Outcomes: The fluid continued to be discharged through the drain even after the surgery; delayed wound healing occurred 4 weeks following the surgery, and there was no recurrence at follow-up conducted 2 years later. Lessons: Calcific myonecrosis is mostly a benign entity, but some cases of calcific myonecrosis cause bone destruction and form non-healing chronic sinuses. In such cases, surgical treatment is required, during which the necrotic tissue and calcific material must be extensively debrided and drained.

J	Cooke, SL; Whittington, AR				Cooke, Shelley L.; Whittington, Abby R.			Influence of therapeutic radiation on polycaprolactone and polyurethane biomaterials	MATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING C-MATERIALS FOR BIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Therapeutic radiation; Polycaprolactone; Polyurethane; Porous scaffolds	THERMAL-PROPERTIES; DEGRADATION; TISSUE; IRRADIATION	Biomedical polymers are exposed in vivo to ionizing radiation as implants, coatings and bystander materials. High levels of ionizing radiation (e.g. X-ray and gamma) have been reported to cause degradation and/or cross-linking in many polymers. This pilot study sought to determine causes of failure, by investigating how therapeutic radiation affects two different porous polymeric scaffolds: polycaprolactone (PCL) and polyurethane (PU). PCL is a bioresorbable material used in biomedical devices (e.g., dentistry, internal fixation devices and targeted drug delivery capsules). PU is commonly used in medical applications (e.g., coatings for pacemakers, tissue expanders, catheter tubing and wound dressings). PU was specifically fabricated to be a non-degradable polymer in this study. Porous scaffolds, fabricated using solvent casting and/or salt leeching techniques, were placed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH = 7.4) and exposed to typical cancer radiotherapy. A total dose of 50 Gy was broken into 25 doses over an eleven-week period. Collected PBS was tested for polymer leachants and degradation products using Gas Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS), results revealed no analyzable leachants from either polymer. Scaffolds were characterized using Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy, Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). No gross visual changes were observed in either polymer, however PU exhibited microstructure changes after irradiation. Increased number average molecular weight and weight average molecular weight in PCL and PU were observed after irradiation, indicating crosslinldng. PU displayed an increase in intrinsic viscosity that further confirms increased crosslinldng. PCL and PU showed decreases in crystallinity after irradiation, and PU crystallinity shifted from long-range-order hard segments to short-range-order hard segments after irradiation. Results from both PCL and PU suggest changes in polymer backbones. This preliminary study suggests that therapeutic radiation doses cause both degradation and crosslinking in PCL and PU.

To overcome the drawbacks of PMMA, a modified augmentation technique applying a self-curing elastomeric material into a balloon-created cavity prior to screw insertion was developed and evaluated. The aim of the study was to compare the effect of the established and novel augmentation technique on pedicle screw anchorage in a biomechanical in vitro experiment. Methods: In ten lumbar vertebral bodies, the right pedicles were instrumented with monoaxial cannulated and fenestrated pedicle screws and augmented in situ with 2 ml PMMA. The left pedicles were instrumented with monoaxial cannulated pedicle screws. Prior to left screw insertion, a balloon cavity was created and filled with 3 ml of self-curing elastomer (silicone). Each screw was subjected to a cranio-caudal cyclic load starting from - 50 to 50 N while the upper load was increased by 5 N every 100 load cycles until loosening or 11,000 cycles (600 N). After cyclic loading, a pullout test of the screws was conducted. Results: The mean cycles to screw loosening were 98241982 and 7401 +/- 1644 for the elastomer and PMMA group, respectively (P = 0.012). The post-cycling pullout test of the loosened screws showed differences in the failure mode and failure load, with predominantly pedicle/vertebrae fractures in the PMMA group (1188.6 N +/- 288.1) and screw pullout through the pedicle (671.3 N +/- 332.1) in the elastomer group. Conclusion: The modified pedicle screw augmentation technique involving a balloon cavity creation and a self-curing elastomeric silicone resulted in a significantly improved pedicle screw anchorage under cyclic cranio-caudal loading when compared to conventional in situ PMMA augmentation.

A multi- functional zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-9-ImBr) consisting of electrophilic cobalt ions, CO2-philic nitrogen-rich units and nucleophilic imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs) was synthesized by simple substitution reaction of amino-functionalized ZIF (ZIF-9-NH2) with 1-(4-bromobutyl)-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([BrBMIM]Br). The obtained ZIF-9-ImBr was employed as heterogeneous catalyst for the solvent-free synthesis of cyclic carbonates from CO2 and epoxides in the absence of any cocatalyst. A certain amount of micropores and abundant nitrogen atoms could facilitate CO2 enrichment and its activation, while the mesopores could enhance the mass transfer of reactant and product molecules. Moreover, the synergistic effect between Lewis-acid cobalt and Lewis-base bromine ions of ZIF-9-ImBr made it promising in the CO2 cycloaddition reaction. As expected, ZIF-9-ImBr displayed good catalytic performance of 93.8 % yield and 98.9 % selectivity of propylene carbonate at 120 degrees C and 2.0 MPa for 3.5 h. Additionally, the reactions proceeded with a broad substrate scope and high selectivity to give the corresponding cyclic carbonates in good to excellent yields (77.9-95.8 %). Even for the challenging internal epoxide, cyclohexene oxide, a satisfactory 71.4 % yield was obtained by extending the reaction time to 24 h. More importantly, ZIF-9-ImBr can be easily recycled and maintains its reactivity and selectivity after five successive cycles. This work highlights the potential of functional ZIF-based materials for targeting CO2 capture and conversion.

Achieving arthrodesis using autogenous bone graft is inconsistent when rigid internal fixation such as transpedicular instrumentation is applied. Synthetic materials, particularly calcium phosphate-based ceramics, have shown promise for spine fusion applications, especially when combined with autograft. Silicate substitution has been shown to enhance the bioactivity of calcium phosphates and may obviate the need for autologous supplementation. PURPOSE: Determine efficacy of silicated calcium phosphate (Si-CaP) compared with autograft to generate solid lumbar fusion. STUDY DESIGN: Comparison of healing of instrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion in ewes at 2 and 6 months using Si-CaP or iliac crest autograft. METHODS: Eighteen skeletally mature ewes underwent implantation of either autograft or SiCaP in the space spanning the L4-L5 transverse process. In vivo quantitative computed tomography (CT) scans were made at 2-month intervals and after euthanasia. Harvested spine segments were radiographed and biomechanically tested in bending at 6 months. Histological assessments were made at 2 and 6 months. RESULTS: Animals receiving Si-CaP graft were biomechanically and radiographically equivalent to those receiving autograft. Fusion mass density and volume were higher for the Si-CaP group throughout the healing period. Si-CaP regenerated normal bone tissue morphology, cellularity, and maturation with no inflammatory responses despite the fact that no autograft, bone marrow aspirate, or blood was mixed with the material. Histomorphometrically, fusion mass was higher for Si-CaP and bony bridging was equivalent when compared with autograft treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Si-CaP was biomechanically, radiographically, and histologically equivalent to autograft in generating a solid, bony, intertransverse process fusion in an ovine model. Both treatment groups achieved 100% bridging fusion after 6 months of healing. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All fights reserved.

It is noted that the biomechanics behaviour of device can be altered by introducing more features such as material suitability and additional components. Therefore, this study was conducted via finite element method to investigate the effects of additional hollow cylinder coated with external fixator screws in treating Type III pilon fracture. Finite element models which have been validated with experimental data were used to simulate stresses at the pin-bone interface and relative micromovement at interfragmentary fractures during swing (70 N load) and stance phases (350 N load). All bones and external fixators were assigned with isotropic material properties while the cartilages were simulated with hyper-elastic. For the hollow cylinder, polyethylene was assigned due to its properties which are equivalent to the bone. From the results, it is found that stresses at the pin-bone interface for the coated screws were reduced to 54% as compared to the conventional fixator. For the micromovement, there was no difference between both models, whereby the value was 0.03 mm. The results supported previously published literature, in which high stresses are unavoidable at the interface, fortunately, those stresses did not exceed the ultimate strength of bone, which is safe for treating patients. In conclusion, if patients are allowed to bear weight bearing, the external fixator with coated screws is a more favourable option to be fixed into the bone to avoid complications at the interface.

J	Chang, HR; Zheng, ZL; Yu, YY; Zhang, YZ				Chang, Hengrui; Zheng, Zhanle; Yu, Yiyang; Zhang, Yingze			The degree of fracture displacement does not affect the risk for concomitant proximal fibular fractures in tibial plateau fractures	INTERNATIONAL ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Tibial plateau fracture; Schatzker classification; Proximal fibula; Column involvement		Objective The proximal fibula plays an important role in the knee joint; however, it has not been given enough attention by surgeons. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors for concomitant proximal fibular fractures in patients with tibial plateau fractures through computed tomography (CT) imaging. Materials and Methods From January 2016 to November 2017, patients who underwent percutaneous reduction and internal fixation (PRIF) for tibial plateau fractures at a level 1 trauma centre institute were included in this retrospective study. Full materials of CT imaging were obtained for measurements. Schatzker's and a newly proposed classification system were used for the fracture of the tibial plateau and proximal fibula, respectively. Several clinical and radiological characteristics were recorded, and the impact of those variables on fibular fractures was assessed with univariate and multivariate analyses. Results In total, 174 patients were enrolled in the study with mean age of 45.6 +/- 13.1 years. The incidence of combined proximal fibular fracture was 38.3%. Schatzker type VI fracture had the highest rate of fibular fracture (77.4%). High-energy-pattern tibial plateau fractures (p=0.029) and posterolateral joint facet (PJF) involvements (p=0.002) are risk factors for proximal fibular fracture on multivariate analysis. Neither posterolateral column (PLC) involvements nor fracture displacement correlated with proximal fibular fractures. Conclusions Proximal fibular fractures were commonly seen among patients who sustained tibial plateau fractures. Schatzker type VI fractures had the highest rate of fibular fractures than other fracture types. High-energy fractures and PJF involvements correlated with a higher risk of proximal fibular fractures. A better understanding and awareness of the risk factors for proximal fibular fractures will provide surgeons with comprehensive understanding of tibial plateau fractures.

One of the potential applications involves monitoring of callus mineralization for longitudinal assessment of fracture healing. However, fracture repair usually involves internal fixation hardware that can generate significant artifacts in reconstructed images. To address this challenge, we develop a novel algorithm that combines simultaneous reconstruction-decomposition using a previously reported method for model-based material decomposition (MBMD) augmented by the known-component (KC) reconstruction framework to mitigate metal artifacts. We apply the proposed algorithm to simulated DE data representative of a dedicated extremity cone-beam CT (CBCT) employing an x-ray unit with three vertically arranged sources. The scanner generates DE data with non-coinciding high- and low-energy projection rays when the central source is operated at high tube potential and the peripheral sources at low potential. The proposed algorithm was validated using a digital extremity phantom containing varying concentrations of Ca-water mixtures and Ti implants. Decomposition accuracy was compared to MBMD without the KC model. The proposed method suppressed metal artifacts and yielded estimated Ca concentrations that approached the reconstructions of an implant-free phantom for most mixture regions. In the vicinity of simple components, the errors of Ca density estimates obtained by incorporating KC in MBMD were similar to 1.5-5x lower than the errors of conventional MBMD; for cases with complex implants, the errors were similar to 3-5x lower. In conclusion, the proposed method can achieve accurate bone mineral density measurements in the presence of metal implants using non-coinciding DE projections acquired on a multisource CBCT system.

Material and methods: Following preliminary testing in an animal model, the multidirectional angular stable system TiFix 2.3 obtained from Litos (Hamburg, Germany) was utilised for internal fixation of 39 mandibular fractures. These involved four symphyseal fractures, 17 parasymphyseal, 16 of the angle of the mandible and two comminuted fractures. The surgical and postoperative course was closely scrutinised. Radiographs were taken after 6 months and all plates removed under local anaesthesia. Photographs were taken intraoperatively and the plates and surrounding soft tissues were salvaged for histological analysis. Additionally, these operations were compared with treatment of equivalent fractures which were treated with conventional, non-angular stable systems. The relative costs have also been evaluated. Results: In 33 of the 39 fractures one TiFix plate sufficed for osteosynthesis. The plate most often used was a 2-hole plate which was applied in 25 (55.5%) fractures, followed by the 4-hole plates used in 16 (35.5%) fractures. In two comminuted fractures, four 6-hole plates were used (9%). In 17 patients the operation lasted less than 30 min, in 20 patients less than 60 min, in two less than 120 min. In all cases, the operations were shorter, and due to the plates' dimensions fewer screws had to be used, thus reducing the costs. Discussion: This angular stable system enabled reduction of the amount of the implant material. Also reduced were the operation time and the cost of the procedure. Furthermore, in the future it will allow smaller access incisions and better preservation of the soft tissue integrity. (c) 2008 European Association for Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery.

The aim of our study was to analyze the results in terms of access, scare quality and complications that could be noticed in a 12 years period of time with the use of the high sub-mandibular approach (HSMA) we first described in 2006 for the surgical treatment of neck and base fractures. Material and method: All the files of patients operated on for condylar neck and base fractures approached by mean of a HSMA between January 2006 and December 2018 in our department and containing information concerning age, sex, type of fracture, kind of osteosynthesis material, operating time, name of the surgeon, postoperative complication linked to the approach, scare quality at 6 months follow-up at least were included. The skin incision and the dissection planes followed the original publication of Meyer et al. in 2006. Results: 434 patients (sex ratio: 2.06, mean age: 32, 496 approaches) met the inclusion criteria. Following the AO classification, 21.2% of the fractures were classified as neck fractures and 78.8% as base fractures. 97.6% of all fractures were stabilized by mean of a 3D plate (TCP1 plate, Medartis, Basel-CH), the remaining ones by mean of a combination of 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0 straight plates. Mean operating time was 40 minutes per side. Patients were operated on by senior surgeons in 71.7% of the cases and by trainees under supervision for the others. Concerning the complications linked to the approach, we noticed 11 (2.2%) temporary (0 definitive) paresis of the facial nerve, 1 (0.2%) hematoma and 1 (0.2%) abscess that both needed revision. Scare was hypertrophic or considered as unaesthetic by the patient in 5 cases (1%). Discussion: The HSMA, if performed as initially described, is a safe and quick procedure compared to other cutaneous approaches. It gives access to all base fractures and to most of neck fractures. The very low rate of facial nerve complications is mainly explained by the plane by plane dissection making it very easy to avoid the facial nerve branches or to check them when encountered. The HSMA is particularly suited to the use of TCP plates as the upper holes of these plates, placed horizontally, are easy to reach from below. The HSMA is therefore still our preferred cutaneous approach to the condylar process. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

In previous clinical and biomechanical studies, implant failure of the posterolateral plate has been reported with orthogonal configurations; however, the reason for screw loosening in the posterolateral plate is unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate biomechanical properties and to clarify the causes of posterolateral plate loosening using a humeral fracture model under axial compression on the radial or ulnar column separately. And we changed only the plate set up: parallel or orthogonal. Materials and methods: We used artificial bone to create an Association for the Study of Internal Fixation type 13-C2.3 intra-articular fracture model with a 1-cm supracondylar gap. We used an anatomically-preshaped distal humerus locking compression plate system (Synthes GmbH, Solothurn, Switzerland). Although this is originally an orthogonal plate system, we designed a mediolateral parallel configuration to use the contralateral medial plate instead of the posterolateral plate in the system. We calculated the stiffness of the radial and ulnar columns and anterior movement of the condylar fragment in the lateral view. Results: The parallel configuration was superior to the orthogonal configuration regarding the stiffness of the radial column axial compression. There were significant differences between the two configurations regarding anterior movement of the capitellum during axial loading of the radial column. Discussion: The posterolateral plate tended to bend anteriorly under axial compression compared with the medial or lateral plate. We believe that in the orthogonal configuration axial compression induced more anterior displacement of the capitellum than the trochlea, which eventually induced secondary fragment or screw dislocation on the posterolateral plate, or nonunion at the supracondylar level. In the parallel configuration, anterior movement of the capitellum or trochlea was restricted because of the angular stability of the plate and locking screws in the condyle. Conclusions: The posterolateral plate tended to bend anteriorly under axial compression of the radial column in the orthogonal configuration, which led to secondary displacement of the posterolateral plate and eventual screw loosening.

Osteosynthesis of periprosthetic type A and B femoral fractures using an unlocked plate with integrated cerclage cable and trochanteric hook: A multicenter retrospective study of 45 patients with mean follow-up of 20 months	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Hip arthroplasty; Periprosthetic fractures; Osteosynthesis; Vancouver classification	TOTAL HIP-ARTHROPLASTY; LOCKING-PLATE; INTERNAL-FIXATION; FEMUR FRACTURES; STABILIZATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; REPLACEMENT; RELIABILITY; MANAGEMENT; MORTALITY	Introduction: Femoral periprosthetic fracture (FPF) is a frequent complication in dependent elderly persons, with a limited life expectancy. Their management is difficult and the choice between osteosynthesis and prosthesis is still matter of discussion. To date, there is no study on unlocked plate with integrated cerclage cable and trochanteric hook for this indication. The objectives of this study were to analyze fracture healing, complication rate and functional outcome. Our hypothesis is that this technique allows a high rate of consolidation and a return to the previous state in terms of autonomy and place of residence. Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective multicenter study between 2010 and 2015. The inclusion criteria were: patients with type A and B FPF according to the classification of Vancouver who received osteosynthesis hook plate. The evaluation focused on the consolidation period, complications and pre and postoperative Parker and Katz scores. Death, nonunion, dislocation, infection and failure of fixation were considered major complications. Results: Forty-five patients met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated at mean 20 months (6-72). All fractures consolidated at a mean 7 weeks (6-10), except one that has not undergone further surgery in the absence of functional impairment. Parker score decreased from 6.4 to 4.9 (p = 0.03) and Katz score from 4.8 to 4.3 (p = 0.045). Five patients died within the year of the operation. Five patients living at home preoperatively were admitted to an institution, the others returned to their retirement home or nursing home. Conclusion: This plate allows for a quick and effective management of patients with FPF. The low rate of complications and the very good consolidation rate lead us to use the same plate even for class B2 or B3 fractures in some patients with precarious health condition who cannot tolerate major revision surgery: Elderly, ASA score >3, loss of autonomy, Katz score <4.

In the present study, we examined the role of implant material and surface topography as influencing factors on the development of infection in an experimental model of plating osteosynthesis in the rabbit. Methods: The implants included in this experimental study were composed of: standard Electropolished Stainless Steel (EPSS), standard titanium (Ti-S), roughened stainless steel (RSS) and surface polished titanium (Ti-P). Construct stability and load-to-failure of Ti-P implants was compared to that of Ti-S implants in a rabbit cadaveric model. In an in vivo study, a rabbit humeral fracture model was used. Each rabbit received one of three Staphylococcus aureus inocula, aimed at determining the infection rate at a low, medium and high dose of bacteria. Outcome measures were quantification of bacteria on the implant and in the surrounding tissues, and determination of the infectious dose 50 (ID50). Results: No significant differences were observed between Ti-S and Ti-P regarding stiffness or failure load in the cadaver study. Of the 72 rabbits eventually included in the in vivo study, 50 developed an infection. The ID50 was found to be: EPSS 3.89 x 10(3) colony forming units (CFU); RSS 8.23 x 10(3) CFU; Ti-S 5.66 x 10(3) CFU; Ti-P 3.41 x 10(3) CFU. Significantly lower bacterial counts were found on the Ti-S implants samples compared with RSS implants (p < 0.001) at the high inoculum. Similarly, lower bacterial counts were found in the bone samples of animals in the Ti-S group in comparison with both RSS and EPSS groups, again at the high inoculation dose (p < 0.005). Conclusion: No significant differences were seen in susceptibility to infection when comparing titanium and steel implants with conventional or modified topographies. Ti-P implants, which have previously been shown in preclinical studies to reduce complications associated with tissue adherence, do not affect infection rate in this preclinical fracture model. Therefore, Ti-P implants are not expected to affect the infection rate, or influence implant stability in the clinical situation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Metsemakers, W.

Benign lesions may cause pathologic fractures, limb length inequities, and growth disturbances. Differential diagnoses, e.g., malignant bone tumors and osteomyelitis, are sometimes difficult to rule out. Objective We aimed to evaluate outcomes in children with benign lesions of the proximal femur treated with curettage, bone grafting, and plate fixation. Methods In this retrospective study, we included 30 children (median age 10.5 years; range 1.1-17.8 years) suffering from bone cysts and tumor-like lesions of the proximal femur region treated between 2002 and 2018. We analyzed plain X-ray images and CT scans in all children and obtained MRI scans in a selected group of children (63.3%). We examined histopathologic biopsy results for all bone lesions before initiating treatment. Surgical management comprised tumor curettage with adjuvant high-speed drilling and allogenic bone grafting supplemented by bone graft substitutes before plate fixation. Median follow-up interval was 87 months (range 24-156 months). We evaluated the healing of lesions according to Capanna's classification and rated functional outcomes according to Merle d'Aubigne and Postel score. Results Overall, 25 of 30 (83.3%) patients were admitted to hospital because of a pathologic fracture. We diagnosed simple bone cysts in 15 (50.0%) patients, aneurysmal bone cysts in 7 (23.5%) patients, and fibrous dysplasia in 8 (26.5%) patients. Bone consolidation was achieved in 22 of 30 (73.3%) patients after a mean of 5 months (range 3-7 months). The main complication was recurrence of the lesion in 4 of 30 (13.3%) patients. With respect to the Merle d'Aubigne and Postel scores, 17 of 30 (56.7%) patients obtained an excellent result (18 points), while 12 (40.0%) patients had a good result (15-17 points) and only 1 (3.3%) patient had a fair result (14 points). Conclusion Surgical treatment of bone cysts and tumor-like lesions of the proximal femur by local resection or destruction of the lesion, followed by filling the defect with bone graft material and internal stabilization represents a safe and effective treatment option in children.

Bone mineral density (BMD) is used as surrogate parameter to quantify bone strength and to predict implant anchorage. BMD can be measured by means of quantitative computer tomography (QCT) or dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). These noninvasive methods for BMD measurement are not available pre- or intra-operatively. Instead, the surgeon could determine bone strength by direct mechanical measurement. We have evaluated mechanical torque measurement for (A) its capability to quantify local bone strength and (B) its predictive value towards load at implant cut-out. Materials and methods Our experimental study was performed using sixteen paired human cadaver proximal femurs. BMD was determined for all specimens by QCT. The torque to breakaway of the cancellous bone structure (peak torque) was measured by means of a mechanical probe at the exact position of subsequent DHS (R) placement. The fixation strength of the DHS (R) achieved was assessed by cyclic loading in a stepwise protocol beginning with 1,500 N increasing 500 N every 5,000 cycles until 4,000 N. Results A highly significant correlation of peak torque with BMD (QCT) was found (r = 0.902, r (2) = 0.814, P < 0.001). Peak torque correlated highly significant with the load at implant cut-out (r = 0.795, P < 0.001). All specimens with a measured peak torque below 6.79 Nm failed at the first load level of 1,500 N. The specimens with a peak torque above 8.63 Nm survived until the last load level of 4,000 N. Conclusion Mechanical peak torque measurement is able to quantify bone strength. In an experimental setup, peak torque identifies those specimens that are likely to fail at low load. In clinical routine, implant migration and cut-out depend on several parameters, which are difficult to control, such as fracture type, fracture reduction achieved, and implant position. The predictive value of peak torque towards cut-out in a clinical set-up therefore has to be carefully validated.

The aim of this study was to assess the long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes of func-tional treatments for mandibular condylar fractures with an articular impact. Materials and Methods: Young patients (< 15 years of age) presenting with either a unilateral or a bilateral mandibular fracture of the condylar process were included in this retrospective study. The clinical analysis focused on investigation of joint amplitudes at 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 months after the beginning of the treatment, and at the end of their physical growth for the long-term study. Other clinical parameters included temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ) disorders and facial asymmetry. Photographs of patients and panoramic X-rays were assessed to identify any growth disorders at the end of the follow-up. Results: One hundred and eight patients were included in this study, and 33 patients who were no longer undergoing mandibular growth at the time of the last follow-up were included in the long-term study. The mean age at the time of the trauma was 9.33 years, and the mean follow-up was 82.2 months. A significant improvement was observed in the maximal mouth opening (MMO), diduction, and propulsion in the first months after the trauma, reaching 44.31 mm (p < 0.0001), 10.50 mm (p = 0.0001), and 6.33 mm (p = 0.01), respectively, at 6 months. Three patients experienced a clinical posterior vertical insufficiency, one of which required a surgical procedure, while four patients exhibited a ramus asymmetry of up to 10 mm, albeit with no clinical consequences. One case of TMJ ankylosis was noted. Conclusion: Our study suggests that functional treatment is appropriate for fractures of the mandibular con-dyle with an articular impact in children, as it promotes mandibular growth and good functional recovery. Children have to be followed up, however, until completion of growth. (C) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis for humerus diaphyseal fractures	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis; diaphyseal fracture; humerus	SHAFT FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; FEMORAL-SHAFT; MIPO; RECONSTRUCTION	Background: Minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) technique is reported as a satisfactory procedure for the treatment of humeral shaft fractures by the anterior approach by several authors. However, none of the published reports had a significant follow-up nor have they reported patient outcomes. We evaluated the clinical, radiographic, and functional outcome over a minimum follow-up of 2 years using the same MIPO technique to humeral shaft fracture. Materials and Methods: 32 adult patients with diaphyseal fractures of the humerus treated with MIPO between June 2007 and October 2008 were included in the study. Patients with metabolic bone disease, polytrauma, and Gustilo and Anderson type 3 open fractures with injury severity score >16 were excluded from the study. All cases were treated with closed indirect reduction and locking plate fixation using the MIPO technique. The surgery time, radiation exposure, and time for union was noted. The shoulder and elbow function was assessed using the UCLA shoulder and Mayo elbow performance scores, respectively. Results: Of the 32 patients in the study, 19 were males and 13 were females. The mean age was 39 years (range: 22-70 years). Twenty-seven of the thirty-two patients (84.3%) had the dominant side fractured. We had eight cases of C2 type; five cases of C1 and A2 type; four cases of B2 type; three cases each of B3, B1, and A1 type; and one case of A3 type of fracture. The mean surgical time was 91.5 minutes (range: 70-120 minutes) and mean radiation exposure was 160.3 seconds (range: 100-220 seconds). The mean radiological fracture union time was 12.9 weeks (range: 10-20 weeks). Shoulder function was excellent in 27 cases (84.3%) and good in remaining 5 cases (15.6%) on the UCLA score. Elbow function was excellent in 26 cases (81.2%), good in 5 cases (15.6%), and fair in 1 case (3.1%) who had an associated olecranon fracture that was fixed by tension band wire in the same sitting. Conclusion: MIPO of the humerus gives good functional and cosmetic results and should be considered one of the management options in the treatment of humeral diaphyseal fractures.

The present study aimed to assess the preliminary outcomes of treatment for PCLTAF with concomitant ipsilateral lower limb fractures by open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF).Materials and MethodsThe medical records of patients who sustained PCLTAF with concomitant ipsilateral lower limb fractures between March 2015 and February 2019 and underwent treatment at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Imaging examinations performed at the time of injury were applied to identify concomitant ipsilateral lower limb fractures. We used 1:2 matching between patients with PCLTAF combined with concomitant ipsilateral lower limb fractures (combined group; n = 11) and those with isolated PCLTAF (isolated group; n = 22). Outcome data were collected, including the range of motion (ROM) and visual analogue scale (VAS), Tegner, Lysholm, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores. At the final follow-up, the clinical outcomes were compared between the combined and isolated groups and between patients who underwent early-stage surgery and those who underwent delayed treatment for PCLTAF.ResultsThirty-three patients (26 males, 7 females) were included in this study, with eleven patients having PCLTAF and concomitant ipsilateral lower limb fractures and a follow-up of 3.1 to 7.4 years (average, 4.8 years). Compared to patients in the isolated group, patients in the combined group demonstrated significantly worse Lysholm scores (85.7 +/- 5.8 vs. 91.5 +/- 3.9, p = 0.040), Tegner scores (4.4 +/- 0.9 vs. 5.4 +/- 0.8, p = 0.006), and IKDC scores (83.6 +/- 9.3 vs. 90.5 +/- 3.0, p = 0.008). Inferior outcomes were found in patients with delayed treatment.ConclusionsInferior results were found in patients with concomitant ipsilateral lower limb fractures, while better outcomes were obtained in patients with PCLTAF through early-stage ORIF using the posteromedial approach. The present findings may help determine the prognoses of patients with PCLTAF combined with concomitant ipsilateral lower limb fractures treated through early-stage ORIF.

The transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments requires adaptations in the physiology of vegetative cells and in the structural properties of their cell walls. Sexual reproduction occurs in Zygnematophyceae by conjugation and results in the formation of zygospores, possessing unique multi-layered cell walls, which might have been crucial in terrestrialization. We investigated the structure and chemical composition of field sampled Spirogyra sp. zygospore cell walls by multiple microscopical and spectral imaging techniques: light microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, transmission electron microscopy following high pressure freeze fixation/freeze substitution, Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. This comprehensive analysis allowed the detection of the subcellular organization and showed three main layers of the zygospore wall, termed endo-, meso- and exospore. The endo- and exospore are composed of polysaccharides with different ultrastructural appearance, whereas the electron dense middle layer contains aromatic compounds as further characterized by Raman spectroscopy. The possible chemical composition remains elusive, but algaenan or a sporopollenin-like material is suggested. Similar compounds with a non-hydrolysable character can be found in moss spores and pollen of higher plants, suggesting a protective function against desiccation stress and high irradiation. While the tripartite differentiation of the zygospore wall is well established in Zygnematopyhceae, Spirogyra showed cellulose fibrils arranged in a helicoidal pattern in the endo- and exospore. Initial incorporation of lipid bodies during early zygospore wall formation was also observed, suggesting a key role of lipids in zygospore wall synthesis. Multimodal imaging revealed that the cell wall of the sexually formed zygospores possess a highly complex internal structure as well as aromatics, likely acting as protective compounds and leading to impregnation. Both, the newly discovered special three-dimensional arrangement of microfibrils and the integration of highly resistant components in the cell wall are not found in the vegetative state. The variety of methods gave a comprehensive view on the intricate zygospore cell wall and its potential key role in the terrestrial colonization and plant evolution is discussed.

Analysis of practices and radiologic results of a cohort of 407 thoracolumbar fractures	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Fracture; Spine; Fusion; Management; Percutaneous approach	INJURY CLASSIFICATION-SYSTEM; VERTEBRAL FRACTURES; SPINE FRACTURES; BURST FRACTURES; INSTRUMENTATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; FIXATION; FUSION	Background: Thoracolumbar fractures are a public health issue due to their severity and frequency. Management varies according to demographic, clinical and radiologic features, from non-operative treatment to extensive fusion. In the two last decades, improvements and new techniques have emerged, such as kyphoplasty and percutaneous approaches. The main goal of this study was to describe the management of thoracolumbar fractures in France in 2018. Hypothesis: The study hypothesis was that management of thoracolumbar fractures in France has progressed in recent decades. Material and methods: The files of 407 adult patients operated on between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2016 for T4-L5 thoracolumbar fracture in 6 French teaching hospitals were retrospectively reviewed, at a mean follow-up at 10.2 +/- 8.2 [1; 42] months. Demographic, surgical and postoperative radiological data were collected. p-values < 0.05 on Student test were considered significant. Results: Five hundred and thirty-one fractures were analyzed (27% of patients presented more than one fracture). Surgery consisted in internal fixation for 56% of patients, including 17% with associated kyphoplasty; 29% had fusion, and 15% stand-alone kyphoplasty. Surgery used an open posterior approach in 54% of cases, and a percutaneous approach in 46%. Initial sagittal angulation was not a significant decision criterion for screwing (p = 0.8) or for a secondary anterior approach in case of fusion (p = 0.6). Immediate postoperative sagittal correction was significantly better with an open than a percutaneous approach (p = 0.004), but without significant difference at last follow-up (p = 0.8). Correction at last follow-up was significantly better with anterior associated to posterior fusion (p = 0.003). Discussion: Management of the thoracolumbar fractures has progressed in France in recent years: 46% of surgeries used a percutaneous approach, compared to 28% in 2013; 90% used a posterior approach only, compared to 83% in 2013; rates of combined approach were unchanged, at 6%. Twenty-five percent of burst fractures were treated by fusion, possibly due to lack of preoperative MRI in 79% of cases. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

The key to achieving this goal is cryo-fixation, where the biological materials, tissues and associated solutions are rapidly frozen and preserved in a vitreous state. We developed a correlative cryo-Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)/Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) protocol that provides quantitative elemental analysis correlated with spatial imaging of cryo-immobilized specimens. We report the accuracy and sensitivity of the cryo-EDS method, as well as insights we derive on biomineralization pathways in a foraminifer. Foraminifera are marine protozoans that produce Mg-containing calcitic shells and are major calcifying organisms in the oceans. We use the cryo-SEM/EDS correlative method to characterize unusual Mg and Ca-rich particles in the cytoplasm of a benthic foraminifer. The Mg/Ca ratio of these particles is consistently lower than that of seawater, the source solution for these ions. We infer that these particles are involved in Ca ion supply to the shell. We document the internal structure of the MgCa particles, which in some cases include a separate Si rich core phase. This approach to mapping ion distribution in cryo-preserved specimens may have broad applications to other mineralized biomaterials. Statement of significance Ions are an integral part of life, and some ions play fundamental roles in cell metabolism. Determining the concentrations of ions in cells and between cells, as well as their distributions at high resolution can provide valuable insights into ion uptake, storage, functions and the formation of biomaterials. Here we present a new cryo-SEM/EDS protocol that allows the mapping of different ion distributions in solutions and biological samples that have been cryo-preserved. We demonstrate the value of this novel approach by characterizing a novel biogenic mineral phase rich in Mg found in foraminifera, single celled marine organisms. This method has wide applicability in biology, and especially in understanding the formation and function of mineral-containing hard tissues. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This cadaveric study was designed to compare the reverse "Y" plasty reconstruction method with the conventional single-bundle technique for the first time. Methods: In this study, 30 cadaveric knees were used and were randomly divided into five groups with six knees each. Six cadaveric knees with intact ACL were treated as the control group, and another six knees with ruptured ACL were treated as the rupture group. In group A, the single-bundle technique was used. In groups B and C, reverse "Y" plasty technique was used, and the grafts were fixed with absorbable biointerference screws in tibiae and absorbable biointerference screws (Group B) or Endobutton (Group C) in femora. Five groups were tested with an MTS material testing machine (MTS-858) by the use of a cyclic loading of 134 N at 15 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees of knee flexion and a combined 7-Nm valgus torque and 5-Nm internal tibial rotation torque at 15 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees and 60 degrees of knee flexion. Results: Both single-bundle and reverse "Y" plasty groups demonstrated similar anteriore posterior stability compared with the control group, whereas the single-bundle group showed inferior rotational stability tested at 30 degrees and 45 degrees of knee flexion than the reverse "Y" plasty group and control group. These two different fixation methods at the femoral site (Group B and C) showed no difference in anterioreposterior and rotational stability. Conclusions: The new reverse "Y" plasty ACL reconstruction method may restore normal knee stability, especially rotational stability, better than single-bundle reconstruction. The translational potential of this article: This study provides strong support for the new reverse "Y" plasty ACL reconstruction technique and is expected to propose a new surgical approach with good biomechanical features.

The extensile lateral approach is commonly preferred because it provides sufficient exposure of the subtalar facet. However, this technique has the risk of complications such as wound necrosis and sural nerve injury. Various minimally invasive approaches, such as sinus tarsi approach, limited posterior approach, and percutaneous approach, have been introduced to reduce possible complications. This study was prospectively performed to evaluate the results of the sinus tarsi approach for Sanders Type 2 calcaneal fractures using postoperative computed tomography (CT). Materials and Methods: Between October 2012 and December 2013, 20 Sanders Type 2 calcaneal fractures were consecutively treated using a sinus tarsi approach and checked using CT preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, and at 12 months after surgery. Clinical evaluations were performed using the visual analog scale (VAS) and the ankle-hindfoot score developed by the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS). Radiographic evaluations were performed using calcaneus lateral and axial radiographs, hindfoot alignment radiograph, and CT. Changes in Bhler's angles and calcaneal widths were evaluated both preoperatively and at last followup. Reduction of the posterior facet was graded according to articular step, defect, and angulation of the posterior facet in CT. Results: VAS and AOFAS scores were significantly improved at 1 year after surgery but did not improve further. Bhler's angles and calcaneal widths were significantly improved after surgery. Bohler's angle was significantly smaller at the last followup than immediately after surgery, whereas calcaneal width was maintained. Reduction of the posterior facet was graded excellent in five feet (25%), good in ten (50%), and fair in five (25%) on immediately postoperative CT. Two feet (10%) had transient sural nerve injury which resolved within 3 months. Five feet (20%) had subfibular pain due to a prominent screw heads. Conclusion: Surgical management using a sinus tarsi approach produced good clinical and radiographic results and low wound complications for Sanders type 2 calcaneal fractures. It is important to have stable fixation and to achieve sufficient reduction of calcaneal width for the prevention of loss of reduction and lateral subfibular impingement.

However, there is no conclusive evidence in the study to demonstrate whether biodegradable magnesium screws promote angiogenesis and no comparison has been made between degradable magnesium screws and traditional screws. Objective To investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of biodegradable magnesium screws in pedicled vascularized iliac bone graft transfer (PVIBGT) for osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). Materials and methods A total of thirty-six patients (37 hips) with ONFH were recruited from March 2020 to July 2022. The study used a single-blind method, and patients who underwent PVIBGT were randomized into three groups: 12 patients (12 hips) were fixed with biodegradable magnesium screws (Group A), 12 patients (13 hips) were fixed with titanium screws (Group B), 12 patients (12 hips) were directly embedded (Group C). The operating time and the length of stay were recorded. Harris scores, radiological examinations (X-ray, CT, DCE-MRI), blood and serum tests were conducted before and after surgery. The gas yield and degradation rates of the magnesium screws were measured at the 3-months and 6-months post-operative follow-ups in Group A. Results There was no statistically significant difference among these three groups in terms of types, gender, age, course of disease, surgical side, operation time, the length of stay (P > 0.05). All patients were followed up for 6 months. The mean Harris scores were higher in all groups 6 months after surgery (P < 0.05). The rates of excellent and good outcomes were 66.7%, 46.2%, and 33.3% in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. PVIBGT and magnesium screws can improve the blood supply of the femoral head via DCE-MRI evaluation. Two patients with poor incision healing received prompt treatment and subsequently recovered well. No adverse events, such as hip infection or deep vein thrombosis, were reported in the patients. The patients had good biocompatibility of magnesium screws, and no fracture of the magnesium screws was observed in Group A. Liver and kidney functions (including serum magnesium) were within normal ranges. The area of the intermuscular air space was 0 cm(2) in follow-ups. The degradation rate of the biodegradable magnesium screws was approximately 10.32% at the 3-months follow-up and 13.72% at the 6-months follow-up. Conclusions PVIBGT has a positive effect, especially with regard to improving blood supply of the femoral head. The fixation of biodegradable magnesium screws is reliable and safe in PVIBGT, and promote angiogenesis.

However, no studies have reported their application in the thoracic vertebrae. Our research is aimed to assess the stability and strength of the TCPS in thoracic vertebrae under osteoporotic condition by three dimensional (3D) finite element method on the basis of medical image reconstruction using computed tomography (CT), and verifying its effectiveness in clinical application. Materials and methods: The 3D finite element models were constructed using Mimcs to transfer two dimensional CT images into 3D models by marching cubes algorithm of six-partition. Six physiological activities were simulated in 3D finite element models. Compared with the strength and stability of the uni-cortical pedicle screw (UCPS) and bi-cortical pedicle screw (BCPS), the effectiveness of TCPS was assessed. The stress distribution and maximum stress were measured to evaluate the strength. The maximum displacement and the range of motion were analysed to assessed the stability. Experimental results: Four geometrically accurate and nonlinear T7-T9 finite element models were constructed successfully by 3D finite element method based on the CT images. Three kinds of internal fixation methods in the osteoporotic thoracic vertebral body can improved the maximum stress, decrease the maximum displacement and range of motion in six physiological activities. The range of motion and maximum displacement of TCPS decreased more significantly than that of UCPS and BCPS. The maximum von Mises stress of TCPS was minimum and UCPS was maximum under the condition of extension, right lateral bending, left rotation and right rotation. Conclusions: Effectively, TCPS can provide better stability and strength than that of UCPS and BCPS techniques in the osteoporotic thoracic vertebrae. In practice, the technique of TCPS can be applied in the osteoporotic thoracic vertebral body to enhance the griping strength of the screws and reduce the risk of pedicle screw loosening. However, further cadaver experiments and more biomechanical analysis are necessary to confirmed our findings. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, investigations of the mechanisms and correlated factors of complicated removal remain scant. This study aims to identify correlated factors for the difficult removal of locking plates and to propose suggestions for decision making regarding implant removal and the prevention of complicated removal. Materials and methods: In total, 308 consecutive patients who underwent LCP/LISS removal from Sep. 2004 to Nov. 2013 were assessed. Using the Mann-Whitney U test, we analysed the correlation between difficult removal and the duration between open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and implant removal as well as the correlation between difficult removal and the patients' age. Using Chi Square test, we assessed the correlations between complicated removal and the size, location, insertion technique and cortical purchase of the locking head screw (LHS). Correlated factors were separately determined in upper and lower extremities. Rates of difficult removal in different fracture locations were evaluated, and postoperative complications were documented. Results: Of the total 308 patients, thirty-seven had intra-operative difficulties, and six patients experienced postoperative complications. Six out of fifteen patients with peri-elbow fractures and five out of seventeen patients with femur fractures suffered difficult removal, while four out of one hundred patients with malleolar fractures had intra-operative difficulties. Difficulties were experienced with 30 of 338 LCPs, 7 of 32 LISSs, 67 of 1533 small-diameter (<= 3.5-mm) LHSs, and 12 of 442 large-diameter (>= 4.5-mm) LHSs. Three LCPs and seventeen small-diameter LHSs were retained. A longer interval between ORIF and removal, younger age and bicortical screws correlated with difficult removal in the upper extremities, and a longer duration before removal, small-diameter LHS and minimally invasive insertion of LHS were predictors in the lower extremities. Conclusions: Complications occur with LCP/LISS removal, and it should not be a routine procedure. If removal is indicated, performing surgery as soon as radiographs show fracture healing is recommended. Different considerations should apply when making decisions and removing implants from patients with different fracture sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

MILITARY MEDICINE			English	Article							OSTEOMYELITIS; EXTREMITY; TIBIA	Introduction Prophylactic local antibiotic therapy (LAbT) to prevent infection in open long bone fracture (OLBF) patients has been in use for many decades despite lack of definitive evidence confirming a beneficial effect. We aimed to evaluate the effect of LAbT on outcomes of OLBF patients on a nationwide scale. Materials and Methods In this retrospective analysis of 2017-2018 American College of Surgeons-Trauma Quality Improvement Program database, all adult (>= 18years) patients with isolated OLBF (non-extremity-Abbreviated Injury Scale<3) were included. We excluded early deaths (<24h) and those who had burns or non-extremity surgery. Outcomes were infectious complications (superficial surgical site infection, deep superficial surgical site infection, osteomyelitis, or sepsis), unplanned return to operating room, and hospital and intensive care unit length of stay (LOS). Patients were stratified into two groups: those who received LAbT and those who did not receive LAbT (No-LAbT). Propensity score matching (1:3) and chi-square tests were performed. Results A total of 61,337 isolated OLBF patients were identified, among whom 2,304 patients were matched (LAbT: 576; No-LAbT: 1,728). Both groups were similar in terms of baseline characteristics. Mean age was 4317years, 75% were male, 14% had penetrating injuries, and the median extremity-Abbreviated Injury Scale was 1 (1-2). Most common fracture locations were tibia (66%), fibula (49%), femur (24%), and ulna (11%). About 52% of patients underwent external fixation, 79% underwent internal fixation, and 86% underwent surgical debridement. The median time to LAbT was 17 (5-72) h, and the median time to debridement was 7 (3-15) h (85% within 24h). The LAbT group had similar rates of infectious complications (3.5% vs. 2.5%, P=0.24) and unplanned return to the operating room (2.3% vs. 2.0%, P=0.74) compared to the No-LAbT group. Patients who received LAbT had longer hospital LOS (16 [10-29] vs. 14 [9-24] days, P<0.001) but similar intensive care unit LOS (4 [3-9] vs. 4 [2-7] days, P=0.19). Conclusions Our findings indicate that prophylactic LAbT for OLBF may not be beneficial over well-established standards of care such as early surgical debridement and systemic antibiotics. Prospective studies evaluating the efficacy, risks, costs, and indications of adjuvant LAbT for OLBF are warranted.

Volar locking plate based on polyetheretherketon (PEEK) polymer has developed lately as an alternative to conventional metallic devices. The advantage of this kind of plates include the lack of metal allergies, radiolucency, low artefacts on MRI or imaging scans and the high resistance associated to loading forces. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological results using a new Carbon-PEEK volar locking plate compared with titanium volar locking plates for the treatment of distal radius fractures. Materials and Methods: Thirty patients were included in this study. They all underwent traumatic intra-articular distal radius fractures and were surgically treated with volar locking plates. The patients were randomly divided in two groups: In Group A (15 patients) the fracture was stabilized with a CarboFix volar locking plate whereas in group B (15 patients) with an Acu-Lock Volar Distal Radius Plate. Range of motion (ROM), grip strength, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score and X-rays were evaluated. The mean follow up was 12 months. Results: Analysis of Wrist ROM revealed that there was no statistical significant difference (p > 0.05) in regards to extension, flexion, ulnar deviation, radial deviation, supination and pronation comparing to the unaffected arm and between Group A and Group B. The mean score on the DASH was 15.3 in Group A and 13.2 in Group B (p > 0.05). Patients were able to return to their normal activities of daily living at an average of 4 weeks post-op in both Groups. Overall, the mean VAS score was 3.6 There were no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) on X-Rays examination between two Groups in regards to alignment and fracture healing. Conclusions: Volar locking plates represent the most common procedure for the treatment of displaced distal radius fractures. In our series Carbon-peek volar locking plates seems to be analogue to titanium volar locking plates in terms of radiographic parameters and functional outcome. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

On the biomechanical role of glycosaminoglycans in the aortic heart valve leaflet	ACTA BIOMATERIALIA			English	Article						Glycosaminoglycan; Heart valve; Mechanical properties; Mechanical test	MEDIAL COLLATERAL LIGAMENT; BIAXIAL MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; INTERNAL SHEAR PROPERTIES; STRESS-RELAXATION; BIOPROSTHETIC VALVES; ANTERIOR LEAFLET; HETEROGRAFT BIOMATERIALS; GLUTARALDEHYDE FIXATION; EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX; FIBER RECRUITMENT	While the role of collagen and elastin fibrous components in heart valve valvular biomechanics has been extensively investigated, the biomechanical role of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) gelatinous-like material phase remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the biomechanical role of GAGs in porcine aortic valve (AV) leaflets under tension utilizing enzymatic removal. Tissue specimens were removed from the belly region of porcine AVs and subsequently treated with either an enzyme solution for GAG removal or a control (buffer with no enzyme) solution. A dual stress level test methodology was used to determine the effects at low and high (physiological) stress levels. In addition, planar biaxial tests were conducted both on-axis (i.e. aligned to the circumferential and radial axes) and at 45 degrees off-axis to induce maximum shear, to explore the effects of augmented fiber rotations on the fiber-fiber interactions. Changes in hysteresis were used as the primary metric of GAG functional assessment. A simulation of the low-force experimental setup was also conducted to clarify the internal stress system and provide viscoelastic model parameters for this loading range. Results indicated that under planar tension the removal of GAGs had no measureable affect extensional mechanical properties (either on- or 45 degrees off-axis), including peak stretch, hysteresis and creep. Interestingly, in the low-force range, hysteresis was markedly reduced, from 35.96 +/- 2.65% in control group to 25.00 +/- 1.64% (p < 0.001) as a result of GAG removal. Collectively, these results suggest that GAGs do not play a direct role in modulating the time-dependent tensile properties of valvular tissues. Rather, they appear to be strongly connected with fiber-fiber and fiber-matrix interactions at low force levels. Thus, we speculate that GAGs may be important in providing a damping mechanism to reduce leaflet flutter when the leaflet is not under high tensile stress. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

Improved bonding can be achieved with self-reinforced composites compared to traditional dual-polymer, fiber-reinforced composites owing to the identical chemistry of the components in SRCs. Bonding between the fiber and matrix phase is an important factor in applications where mechanical stability is required, such as in the field of bone repair. In this study, we prepared bioabsorbable poly(L-lactic acid)/hydroxyapatite (PLLA/HA) self-reinforced composites via a three-step process that includes surface etching of the fiber, the deposition of the HA coating onto the PLLA fibers through immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF), and hot compaction molding. Although coated with a layer of HA, self-reinforced composites were successfully generated by hot compaction. The effects of compaction time (15 and 30 min), compaction temperature (140, 150, 155, 160, 165, and 170 degrees C), and HA wt% (0, 5, 10, and 15 wt%) on flexural mechanical properties were studied. Mechanical test results indicated that in unfilled (no HA) PLLA SRCs, compaction time and temperature increased the flexural modulus of the composites tested. Based on the results obtained for unfilled composites, a single compaction time and temperature condition of 15 min and 170 degrees C were selected to study the effect of HA loading on the composite mechanical properties. HA was successfully loaded onto the fibers at 0, 5, 10, and 15 wt% before hot compaction and was found to significantly increase flexural modulus (P=0.0001). Modulus values ranged from 8.3 GPa +/- 0.5 (0 wt% HA) to 9.7 GPa +/- 0.6 (15 wt% HA). Microscopy results suggest that the HA in these composites forms a nodular-like structure along the fibers, which allows polymer polymer contact yet prevents longitudinal shear. The procedure used successfully generated composites with flexural moduli near the lower range of bone that may have a possible clinical use for load-bearing bone-fixation devices.

Early initiation of physical therapy after geriatric hip fracture surgery is associated with shorter hospital length of stay and decreased thirty-day mortality	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Hip fracture; physical therapy; postoperative mobilization; fragility fracture; mortality; length of stay	1-YEAR MORTALITY; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; COSTS; AMBULATION; IMPACT; TIME	Introduction: While the importance of timely surgery and early mobilization are understood in geriatric fracture populations, the relationship between timing of initiation of physical therapy (PT) postoperatively on length of stay (LOS) and mortality has not been well delineated. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effect of PT initiated on postoperative day zero (POD0) on LOS and mortality in geriatric hip fracture patients.Materials and Methods: Patients aged 60 and over who underwent hip fracture surgery, including arthroplasty or internal fixation, between January 2017 and December 2019 at three affiliated academic hospitals were identified. Retrospective chart review and review of hospital charges were used to determine patient demographics, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), surgery performed, timing of postoperative PT visits, LOS, and mortality.Results: Of 1,551 patients identified that met inclusion criteria, 83 (5.3%) received PT on POD0. Most patients (76.3%) received PT on postoperative day 1 (POD1), and 18.4% received first PT on postoperative day 2 or later (POD2 + ). Time from admission to surgery, CCI, sex, and BMI did not differ significantly between groups. The age difference between patients in the POD0 and the POD1/POD2 + groups was statistically significant with the mean age in the POD1/2 + group being 2.3 years older than the POD0 group ( p = 0.045) . There was no difference in postoperative length of stay (PLOS) based on type of fixation. The average PLOS was 3.4 days in the POD0 PT group compared to 5.2 days in the POD1 group ( p < 0.0 0 01 ) and 8.2 days in the POD2 + group ( p < 0.0 0 01 ). The POD0/1 group had significantly lower mortality than the POD2 + group [3.7% vs. 9.8%, OR 0.354 (95% CI 0.217-0.575), p < 0.0 0 01 ].Conclusion: Earlier initiation of PT postoperatively is associated with significantly shorter total and postoperative LOS and initiation of PT before POD2 is associated with decreased 30-day mortality. Each day that initiation of PT is delayed is associated with a two- to three-day increase in LOS.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Materials and Methods: Forty five patients were included in the study in whom unilateral high IAT were identified and were subjected to two-stage laparoscopic orchiopexy. Patients were prospectively randomized into two groups according to laparoscopic technique in use; either two stage Fowler-Stephens laparoscopic orchiopexy (FSLO) or staged laparoscopic traction orchiopexy (SLTO). Intraoperative evaluation for the distance of the testis from the internal ring, state of the internal ring (closed or open), operative time (min), intraoperative and early postoperative complications were recorded after first stage. Surgical outcomes of both techniques included operative time, intraoperative complications, success rate, final scrotal site position, testicular size and vascularity, and these were recorded within 48h of the second stage procedure and at 6 month follow-up. Results: Staged FSLO was performed on 25 testes. Four cases were lost during follow up. Out of these 21 cases, one child had an atrophic testis before the second stage based on previously recorded operative size. SLTO was done on 20 testes. We had 2 cases of fixation suture slippage rendering a total of 18 patients who underwent second stage operation. No patients converted from laparoscopic to open surgery. At 6 month follow-up visits, 27 testes were found on examination to have a low scrotal position, (14 in the FSLO group and 13 in the SLTO group), 9 testes in high scrotal position (5 in the FSLO group and 4 in the SLTO group). Testicular ascent occurred in one patient in each group. Testicular atrophy was identified in 3 cases among the FS group, while no case of testicular atrophy occurred in the traction group of patients (p = 0.048). Conclusions: Both staged laparoscopic techniques had comparable success rates as regard final scrotal position for high undescended IAT in children, and were associated with no intra or post operative complications. SLTO had a better outcome as it was not associated with any testicular atrophy compared to FSLO at 6 months follow up. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Kettle holes reflect the biogeochemical characteristics of their catchment area and the intensity of the element-specific input	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS			English	Article						Agricultural soils; Soil erosion; Element mobility; Phosphorus; Kettle hole; Sediment	NATURAL PONDS; LAND-USE; CARBON; WATER; PHOSPHORUS; SEDIMENT; EROSION; NUTRIENT; HYDROPERIOD; NITROGEN	Purpose Kettle holes are small inland water bodies known to be dominated by terrigenous material; however, the processes and structures that drive the enrichment and depletion of specific geochemical elements in the water column and kettle hole sediment remain unclear. We hypothesized that the mobile elements (Ca, Fe, K, P) behave different from each other in their transport, intermediate soil retention, and final accumulation in the kettle hole sediment. Methods Topsoils from transects spanning topographic positions from erosional to depositional areas, sediment cores, shallow groundwater, and kettle hole water of two glacial kettle holes in NE Germany (Rittgarten (RG) and Kraatz (KR)) were collected. The Fe, Ca, K, and total P (TP) concentrations were quantified and additionally the major anions in shallow groundwater and kettle hole water. The element-specific mobilization, relocation, and, finally, accumulation in the sediment were investigated by enrichment factors. Furthermore, a piper diagram was used to estimate groundwater flow directions and pond-internal processes. Results At KR only, the upper 10 cm of the kettle hole sediment reflected the relative element composition of the eroded terrestrial soils. The sediment from both kettle holes was enriched in Ca, Fe, K, and P compared to topsoils, indicating several possible processes including the input of clay and silt sized particles enriched in these elements, fertilizer input, and pond-internal processes including biogenic calcite and hydroxyapatite precipitation, Fe-P binding (KR), FeSx formation (RG), and elemental fixation and deposition via floating macrophytes (RG). High Ca concentrations in the kettle hole water indicated a high input of Ca from shallow groundwater inflow, while Ca precipitation in the kettle hole water led to lower Ca concentration in groundwater outflow. Conclusions The considerable element losses in the surrounding soils and the inputs into the kettle holes should be addressed by comprehensive soil and water protection measures, i.e., avoiding tillage, fertilizing conservatively, and creating buffer zones.

Surgical treatment, complications, and reimbursement among patients with clavicle fracture and acromioclavicular dislocations: a US retrospective claims database analysis	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Clavicle fracture; acromioclavicular joint; surgery; complications; reoperation; infection; non-union; mal-union; reimbursement	NONOPERATIVE TREATMENT; PLATE FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT; IPSILATERAL FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; MANAGEMENT; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Aims: To assess rates of surgical treatment, post-surgical complications, reoperations, and reimbursement in patients with clavicle fractures and acromioclavicular (AC) dislocations. Materials and methods: This US retrospective study used data from patients with >= 1 diagnosis of clavicle fracture or AC dislocation (index) between 2012-2016. Surgical treatment was defined as a procedure within 4 weeks after clavicle fracture/AC dislocation. Rates of complications (infection, non-union, mal-union), reoperations (device removal or revisions), and all-cause healthcare reimbursement (adjusted to 2016$) were evaluated 2 years post-index among surgical patients. Results: A total of 95,243 patients with clavicle fracture and 52,100 patients with AC dislocation were identified. Mean (SD) age for clavicle fracture and AC dislocation was 23.8 (18.6) and 33.0 (15.6) years, respectively. Most clavicle fracture and AC dislocation patients were male (70.9% and 78.0%, respectively), and had few comorbidities (86.4% and 84.8% had a Charlson Comorbidity Index = 0 and 73.1% and 66.0% had Elixhauser = 0, respectively). Only 15.2% of clavicle fracture and 5.3% of AC dislocation patients received surgical treatment. Among patients undergoing surgical treatment, 2-year rates of infection, non-union, and mal-union were 1.0%, 4.2%, and 0.9%, respectively, for clavicle fracture, and 2.0%, 0.9%, and 0.1%, respectively, for AC dislocation. Reoperations occurred in 83.0% of clavicle fracture and 67.5% of AC dislocation patients. Mean (SD) 2-year reimbursement was $27,635 ($68,173) for clavicle fracture and $23,096 ($28,746) for AC dislocation. Limitations: Administrative claims data lack clinical information, limiting inferences that can be made. This data may not be generalizable to other patients. Conclusions: Rates of surgical treatment for clavicle fractures and AC dislocation and rates of infection, non-union, and mal-union among surgically-treated patients were low. However, surgical patients had high rates of device removal or revision surgery during 2-year follow-up. Improved surgical methods and technologies could reduce non-planned reoperations and device removals, thereby reducing healthcare system costs.

In Vitro Biomechanical Evaluation of the Use of Conventional and Locking Miniplate/Screw Systems for Sagittal Split Ramus Osteotomy	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							RIGID INTERNAL-FIXATION; MANDIBULAR ADVANCEMENT; SKELETAL STABILITY; FUNCTIONAL STABILITY; ORTHOGNATHIC SURGERY; POSITION SCREWS; STABILIZATION	Purpose: The aim of this in vitro study was to assess the biomechanical stability of 9 different osteosynthesis methods after sagittal split ramus osteotomy by simulating the masticatory forces and using a 3-point biomechanical test method. Materials and Methods: Forty-five polyurethane hemimandibles with bone-like consistency were randomly assigned to 9 groups (n = 5) and subjected to sagittal split ramus osteotomy. After 4-mm advancement of the distal segment, the bone segments were fixed by different osteosynthesis methods using 2.0-mm miniplate/screw systems: group A, one 4-hole conventional straight miniplate; group B, one 4-hole locking straight miniplate; group C, one 4-hole conventional miniplate and one bicortical screw; group D, one 4-hole locking miniplate and 1 bicortical screw; group E, one 6-hole conventional straight miniplate; group F, one 6-hole locking straight miniplate; group (3: two 4-hole conventional straight miniplates; group H. two 4-hole locking straight miniplates; and group 1, 3 bicortical screws in an inverted-L. pattern. All models were mounted on a base especially constructed for this purpose. Using a 3-point biomechanical test model, the hemimandibles were loaded in compressive strength in an Instron machine (Norwood, MA) until a 3-mm displacement occurred between segments vertically or horizontally. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance and Tukey test (alpha = 1%). Results: The multiparametric comparison of the groups showed a statistically significant difference (P<.01) between groups that used 2 miniplates (groups G and H), 1 miniplate and 1 bicortical screw (groups C and D), and only bicortical screws (group D compared with groups that used only 1 miniplate with 2 screws per segment (groups A and B) and 3 screws per segment (groups E and F). Conclusion: The placement of 2.0-mm-diameter bicortical screws in the retromolar region, associated or not with conventional and locking miniplates with monocortical screws, promoted a better stabilization of bone segments. Locking miniplates presented a better performance in bone fixation in all groups.

Various factors, such as various fracture sites, fracture types, and accompanying fractures at other sites, act as error variables in the evaluation of routine OIRS. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefits of orthopedic implant removal surgery (OIRS) in patients with no implant-related symptoms such as infection and soft tissue irritation after union of isolated lower extremity shaft fractures from a patient-centered evaluation Materials and methods Eighty-four patients who achieved fracture union after internal fixation of femoral shaft or tibial shaft fractures (March 2004 to December 2018) and who showed no implant-related symptoms were evaluated retrospectively. Minimum post-OIRS follow-up period was 1 year. Thirty-eight patients were treated with intramedullary nail and 13 were treated with plate and screws for femoral shaft fracture. Twenty patients were treated with intramedullary nail and 13 were treated with plate and screws for tibial shaft fracture. All patients subsequently underwent OIRS. Quality of life (QoL) and lower extremity pain using visual analogue scale (VAS) were evaluated 1 day before OIRS. Patient satisfaction with the OIRS, VAS, and QoL were assessed at least 1 year after OIRS using the SF-36 questionnaire. Results The physical component score, mental component score, and scores of all eight domains showed significant improvement after OIRS (p < 0.01). Patients with femoral shaft fractures tended to have lower pre- and post-OIRS SF-36 scores than those with tibial shaft fracture. Among patients with femoral shaft fracture, SF-36 scores were comparable in the nail and plate groups. Among patients with tibial shaft fracture, nail group showed relatively better QoL than the plate group, before and after OIRS in spite of several complications such as formation of scar tissue, nerve damage, and refracture. Conclusions Patients with no implant-related symptoms showed significant improvement in QoL and satisfaction after OIRS. This suggests that OIRS is beneficial from the patients' evaluation.

Optimal Entry Point and Trajectory for Anterior C1 Lateral Mass Screw	CLINICAL SPINE SURGERY			English	Article						atlas; anatomy; lateral mass screw; anterior; trajectory	FUNCTION-PRESERVING OPTION; INTERNAL CAROTID-ARTERY; ATLANTOAXIAL-DISLOCATION; ATLANTOODONTOID JOINT; TRANSORAL APPROACH; OSTEOSYNTHESIS C1; PLATE FIXATION; PLACEMENT; REDUCTION; FUSION	Study Design: A radiographic analysis of the anatomy of the C1 lateral mass using computed tomography (CT) scans and Mimics software. Objective: To define the anatomy of the C1 lateral mass and make recommendations for optimal entry point and trajectory for anterior C1 lateral mass screws. Summary of Background Data: Although various posterior insertion angles and entry points for screw insertion have been proposed for posterior C1 lateral mass screws, no large series have been performed to assess the ideal entry point and optimal trajectory for anterior C1 lateral mass screw placement. Materials and Methods: The C1 lateral mass was evaluated using CT scans and a 3-dimensional imaging application (Mimics software). Measuring the space available for the anterior C1 lateral mass screw (SAS) at different camber angles from 0 to 30 degrees (5-degree intervals) was performed to identify the ideal camber angle of insertion. Measuring the range of sagittal angles was performed to calculate the ideal sagittal angle. Other measurements involving the height of the C1 lateral mass were also made. Results: The optimal screw entry point was found to be located on the anterior surface of the atlas 12.88mm (+/- 1.10 mm) lateral to the center of the anterior tubercle. This optimal entry point was found to be 6.81mm (+/- 0.59 mm) superior to the anterior edge of the atlas inferior articulating process. The mean ideal camber angle was 20.92 degrees laterally and the mean ideal sagittal angle was 5.80 degrees downward. Conclusions: These measurements define the optimal entry point and trajectory for anterior C1 lateral mass screws and facilitate anterior C1 lateral mass screw placement. A thorough understanding of the local anatomy may decrease the risk of injury to the spinal cord, vertebral artery, and internal carotid artery. Delineating the anatomy in each case with preoperative 3D CT evaluation is recommended.

Dermal glands in freshwater mites <i>Limnesia undulata</i> (OF Muller, 1776) and <i>Limnesia fulgida</i> (CL Koch, 1836) (Acariformes, Limnesiidae)	ARTHROPOD STRUCTURE & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Anatomy; Ultrastructure; Dermal glands; Water mites; Secretion	ACARI; MORPHOLOGY; SILK	Dermal glands in the water mites Limnesia undulata (O.F. Muller, 1776) and Limnesia fulgida (C.L. Koch, 1836) and their secretion were studied by means of light microscopical, transmission electron microscopical (TEM) and scanning electron microscopical (SEM) methods. These mites possess two types of dermal glands - the 'common' dermal glands in a number of 14 pairs and one pair of the so-called 'idiosomal' dermal glands. The common dermal glands are bi-lobed organs and consist of high prismatic secretory cells directed to the gland mouth and mostly replacing the intra-alveolar lumen. The cells contain numerous cisterns of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and specifically organized Golgi bodies (GB) producing electron-dense elongated secretory granules. These granules are released from the cells via apocrine secretion and come to the gland mouth, where they are sometimes accompanied by secretory cell cytoplasm. The final secretion may show a fibrous character. The idiosomal glands are saclike organs stretched along the ventral body wall in posterior direction from the gland orifice corresponding to the epimeroglandularia 4. The secretory epithelium leaves a large intra-alveolar lumen filled with an electron-dense secretory material. Golgi bodies are organized identically with those in the common glands, which indicates the general homology of these two types of dermal glands. The glands' orifices are organized similarly in all glands and possess an internal funnel-shaped sclerite with muscle armament, an internal valve, medial epicuticular flaps and an external circular cuticular ring. All glandularia, except for E4 and V1, are accompanied with a long and thin sensitive seta. During fixation, secretion of the common dermal glands is extruded to the exterior in the form of large amounts of convoluted tube-like structures. In the living organisms, being secreted in mass from the glands, this secretion acquires the form of long rigid mostly hollow un-branched threads comparable with the similar silken threads of other water arthropods. The function of the idiosomal glands secretion still remains unknown. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Materials and methods: Using a 3D motion analyzer, free mandibular border movements were recorded in 21 patients successfully treated for unilateral fractures of the mandibular condylar process (nine patients: open reduction, rigid internal fixation, and functional treatment; 12 patients: closed reduction and functional treatment; follow-up: 6-66 months), and in 25 control subjects. Results: No differences were found among the groups at maximum mouth opening (MO), protrusion and in lateral excursions. During opening, the patients had a larger maximal deviation to the fractured side than the controls (controls 2.3 mm, open treatment 3.9 mm, closed treatment 4.2 mm; Kruskal Wallis test, p = 0.014; closed treatment vs. controls, p = 0.004), with a larger coronal plane angle (controls 2.4 degrees, open treatment 3.6 degrees, closed treatment 4.4 degrees; p = 0.016; closed treatment vs. controls, p = 0.013). In the closed treatment patients, a longer follow-up was related to increased maximum MO (p = 0.04), sagittal plane angle (p = 0.03), and reduced lateral mandibular deviation during MO (p = 0.03). Conclusion: Mandibular condylar fractures can recover good function; some kinematic variables of mandibular motion were more similar to the norm in the open treatment patients than in closed treatment patients.

In this paper the kinetics of absorption of As(V) on Fe(III)-loaded sponge have been studied and the results are compared with those of other natural and synthetic adsorbents. Arsenate was adsorbed very rapidly by Fe(III)-loaded sponge with saturation being reached in less than ten minutes. Arsenate was also adsorbed by Fe(III)-loaded Lewatit-TP-207 and non-loaded Purolite A100S ion-exchange resins but the times required to reach total saturation of the adsorbent were more than 100 minutes. The experimental data followed first-order kinetics. The extraordinarily superior kinetics are postulated to be related to the open-celled internal structure of the sponge material. The effect of flow rate on the dynamic removal of As(V) was studied in a fixed-bed column reactor for Fe(III)-loaded sponge and Fe(III)-loaded resin. The adsorption of As(V) on fixed-bed columns of adsorbent also indicated better kinetic properties for the sponge. Column studies showed a good correlation between the experimental data and the calculated breakthrough curves obtained by the Wolborska and Clark models. Application of the Wolborska model to the data at low C/C-0 ratios enabled the determination of the kinetic coefficient of mass transfer for the sponge and resin materials at the different flow rates used and gave a good prediction of the 5% breakthrough times. Furthermore, the breakthrough curves were well described by the Clark model at the ratios of concentration of effluent to influent up to 0.5 for the sponge and 0.3 for the Fe(III)-loaded resin. Above these levels, a large deviation occurred for the resin adsorption. Thus, the sponge was found to be kinetically effective and favored for As(V) adsorption from solution over the conventional adsorbents used and for most of the adsorbents reported in the bibliography.

We combined the main technical details of 2 previously reported surgical techniques to simplify the surgical approach. We report the key points of this revisited surgical correction for megaprepuce and the long-term results. Materials and Methods: Penile reconstruction was performed between March 2004 and March 2009 in 26 children 2 to 19 months old (median age 6) with congenital megaprepuce. Surgical repair consisted of limited preputial resection of the phimotic ring, wide dissection of the outer prepuce to the base of the penis, fixation of the proximal outer prepuce to Buck's fascia to create a new penoscrotal junction, and unfurling and wide tailoring of the inner prepuce in the ventral midline to resurface the whole elongated penile shaft. A bladder catheter was left in place for 5 or 6 days. Only patients with at least 6 months of followup were included in analysis. Results: All patients underwent surgery on an outpatient basis. Operative time was between 50 and 85 minutes. Median followup was 17.6 months (range 6 to 59). Two patients had slight dehiscence of the ventral suture, which healed spontaneously without a scar. In 1 patient transient urethral meatal stenosis developed. The final cosmesis result was adequate in all patients. Conclusions: It is possible to correct megaprepuce and achieve an adequate genital aspect with a simple approach of resurfacing the penis with the unfurled, tailored inner prepuce.

MATERIAL OF STUDY: Retrospective evaluation of patients who underwent surgical reduction of condylar fracture from January 2012 to December 2014 at the Department of Cranio Maxillo-Facial Surgery of the University Hospital of Catanzaro, Italy. All the patients were clinically assessed for signs/symptoms of infection, signs of Frey 's syndrome or salivary fistula, facial nerve palsy ,postoperative scar, TMJ function, and occlusion with range of mouth opening and deviation. RESULTS: The sample was composed of 15 patients. Good results were achieved in all patients and with an average follow-up of 20 months. No major intraoperative or postoperative complication remained at 6 months of postoperative follow-up. DISCUSSION: Management of condylar fractures is still one of the most controversial topics in maxillofacial surgery. Regarding our experience with the mini-retromandibular approach, we evaluate the advantages in comparison with other extra-oral approaches. Advantages include the shorter working distance from the skin incision to the condyle with direct alignment of the fractured segments, less conspicuous facial surgical scarring with good cosmetic result, short operation time, with a low risk of postoperative complications and possible injuries of the facial nerve. CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, we believe that the mini-retro-mandibular approach is a viable and safe approach for the surgical treatment of condylar fractures, with a relatively low risk of postoperative complications.

Population concentration, lifestyle, cultural background, and socioeconomic status can affect the prevalence of maxillofacial injuries. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the maxillofacial fractures epidemiology and treatment plans in hospitalized patients (2012-2014) which would be useful for better policy making strategies. Material and Methods: In this retrospective study, the medical records of 386 hospitalized patients were evaluated from the department of maxillofacial surgery at Bahonar Hospital of Kerman, Iran. The type and cause of fractures and treatment plans were recorded in a checklist. For data analysis, ANOVA, t-test, Chi-square, and Fisher's exact test were performed, using SPSS version 21. Results: The majority of patients were male (76.5%). Most subjects were within the age range of 20-30 years. Fractures were mostly caused by accidents, particularly motorcycle accidents (MCAs), and the most common site of involvement was the mandible (parasymphysis). There was a significant association between the type of treatment and age. In fact, the age group of 16-59 years under went open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) more than other age groups (P=0.02). Also, a significant association was observed between gender and the occurrence of fractures (P=0.01). Conclusions: Considering the geographic and cultural indices of the evaluated population, it can be concluded that patients age and gender and trauma causes significantly affect the prevalence of maxillofacial traumas and fracture kinds and treatment plans.

Although continuous infusion (CI) of FVIII concentrate during surgical procedures in haemophilia A patients has been shown to be beneficial, some publications suggest that CI increases the risk of inhibitor generation. We conducted a prospective subgroup analysis to investigate if CI of the high-purity, pasteurized, plasma-derived FVIII concentrate Beriate (R) P during surgery increases the risk of inhibitor formation. Materials and methods: Patients with severe haemophilia A (FVIII:C<1%) were included if they presented with a negative history of previous inhibitors, had >= 50 exposure days, and had been scheduled for a planned surgical procedure. A bolus infusion (30-50 IU/kg body weight) of Beriate (R) P was administered intravenously and followed by CI at a rate of 3-4 IU/kg body weight/hour. Dose adjustments were subsequently made based on daily measurements of plasma FVIII activity. Results: Five patients (aged 8-34 years) with severe haemophilia A were included. The surgical procedures ranged from teeth extraction to internal fixation of a fracture. There was no inhibitor generation with CI of Beriate (R) P in patients undergoing surgery, and we did not observe any complications due to re-bleeding or virus transmission. Conclusion: Beriate (R) P was efficacious, safe, and well tolerated during CI. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The crystallization behavior, mechanical property and in vitro degradation of HA/PLGA composite were studied by scanning electron microscope, differential scanning calorimeter, polarized optical microscopy, electromechanical universal tester and soaking in simulated body fluid (SBF) at 37 degrees C for 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks, comparing with pure PLGA. The results showed that n-HA had better mechanical increment effect for PLGA than w-HA, because of the more uniformly dispersion in PLGA matrix without any cavities and the better promotion crystallization effectiveness in HA/PLGA composite than w-HA. However, the in vitro degradation showed that w-HA could keep denser microstructure so that the w-HA/PLGA composite had lower bending strength reduction percent than the n-HA/PLGA composite, owing to the higher crystallinity of w-HA and the more perfectly microcrystalline of PLGA (PLGA/w-HA) than n-HA. The study would be of guidance to select the suitable filler for poly(lactic acid) (PLA) or PLGA polymers in manufacturing bone fracture internal fixation material in future. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Materials and methods In total, 20 cadavers fixed in 10% formalin were used in this study. Of these cadavers, 14 were male and six were female, with a mean age at death of 57 (42-82 years). The four windows were defined as follows in all the cadavers: pubic, quadrilateral, sacroiliac, and iliac windows. Results The most important structure at risk in the pubic window was the corona mortis, as it was observed in 12 (60%) cadavers. In men, the spermatic cord was an important structure at risk in the pubic window. The obturator vessels and nerves were the structures at most risk in the quadrilateral window due to their close location with the quadrilateral surface. The obturator nerve on the medial side and at the entrance of the pelvis through the linea terminalis and lumbosacral truncus were the structures at most risk close to the sacroiliac joint in the sacroiliac window. Conclusion This anatomical study includes highly instructive visual shapes and cadaver images for the acetabulum and pelvis, whose anatomical structures are quite complex. We have found that this modified pararectus approach provides excellent access to the internal pelvic rim.

Yet, unfortunately it is also injury prone. The aim of the study was to perform a biomechanical analysis of the forces which act during arm wrestling, as well as to explain the mechanism of the occurrence of humeral fractures of a similar topology as observed on X-rays. Material/Methods: During the period 2001 to 2008 nine cases of humeral fractures resulting from arm wrestling were consulted and treated at the Clinic. The assessment of the limb condition included an interview and the examination of the fractured extremity. All the patients underwent surgical treatment, using the method of open reduction and internal fixation. The virtual dynamic model of the upper limb was established on the basis of a series of computer tomography scans of the bone, and literature data. The biomechanical analysis was carried out using the Finite Elements Method (FEM). Results: There were five cases of the 12-B1 type in the AO Classification with butterfly fragments in five cases, and four of the 12-A1 type without the butterfly fragment. The maximum bone stress resulting from torsional loading which occurs during arm wrestling amounted to 60 MPa and was located 115 mm above the elbow on the medial - posterior side of the humeral. Conclusions: The strength analysis carried out during arm wrestling revealed that the forces of the acting muscles significantly exert stresses within the distal third of the humeral.

Management of open olecranon fractures using clamp-cum-compressor device	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Clamp-cum-compressor; olecranon fractures; open fractures		Background: Open fractures of olecranon are not a rare occurrence in patients with road traffic accidents particularly motor bike riders who dont use elbow guards. Definitive treatment has to be delayed in many till the wound heals. The present study was conducted to evaluate the results of open fractures of olecranon using clamp-cum-compressor device. Materials and Methods: Seventeen patients between the ages of 20 and 45 years of open olecranon fractures reported 5-20 days after injury were treated using an indigenous clamp-cum-compressor. All fractures were Mayo type II-A, i.e., displaced, stable and noncomminuted. Four patients had Gustilo-Anderson grade I and 13 had Gustilo-Anderson grade II open fractures. The patients with transverse or short oblique fractures were included in the study. The apparatus was applied under regional anesthesia after thorough washing and debridement of wounds with few loose sutures applied wherever needed. The wounds healed within 2-4 weeks and fractures united within 8-10 weeks. The elbow was mobilized with apparatus still in place. The results were evaluated by MayoElbow performance score. Results: We achieved excellent results in twelve patients, good in four and poor in one patient, who reported late, hooks of the apparatus were cut through the proximal fragment, leading to union of fracture in elongation and restricted elbow movements. Conclusion: The apparatus was found to be quite useful in transverse and short oblique fractures with contamination or infection, where internal fixation has to be delayed or avoided.

The most popular operation for the valgus deformity has been the Grice talocalcaneal blocking. It has not been studied primarily in children with spina bifida. We report a prospective series, we present the results of hind foot valgus deformity of children with spina bifida, using Grice talocalcaneal arthrodesis with a tricortical iliac bone graft. Materials and Methods: Between May 2000 and December 2003, 21 patients with bilateral (42 feet) valgus deformity of feet underwent surgery. There were 7 males and 14 females. The mean age of patients was 67.7 months (range 50-108 months). Results: The total number of feet that had nonunion was 11, in 7 of them the grafts were completely reabsorbed and the outcome of all these feet was unsatisfactory. Four feet had partial union of which three had unsatisfactory and one had satisfactory outcome. Sixteen feet had residual valgus deformity at the last followup visit, 10 patients had nonunion, and 6 had inadequate correction. Mean preoperative talocalcaneal and calcaneal pitch angles were 48.5 and 31.9, respectively, which decreased to 38.5 and 29.1, respectively, postoperatively. The decrease in talocalcaneal angle and calcaneal pitch was significant between preoperative and postoperative measurements (P< 0.05). Conclusion: Grice subtalar arthrodesis technique is still a valuable option for valgus foot in patients with spina bifida. In this study, we found more encouraging results in older patients.

We compared the effects of anterior and posterior decompressions in treatment of these patients. Material/Methods: A total of 80 male patients with traumatic thoracolumbar spinal fractures and spinal cord injury were prospectively selected and divided into 2 groups. The control group underwent posterior decompression and internal fixation and the observation group underwent real-time anterior decompression. Results: The observation group had longer operative time and length of postoperative hospital stay, larger intraoperative blood loss, remarkably greater immediate postoperative anterior height and middle column height of the fractured vertebrae, and a notably smaller Cobb's angle than in the control group. The total ASIA score was significantly higher in the observation group than in the control group immediately after surgery and at 6 months and 1 year after surgery. The maximal urine flow, maximal detrusor pressure, and bladder compliance were also evidently higher in the observation group than in the control group during 1 year of follow-up. Compared with the control group, the International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) score in the observation group was significantly higher at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery. Conclusions: Compared with the posterior approach, anterior decompression in patients with thoracolumbar spinal fractures complicated with spinal cord injury can effectually enhance the surgical efficiency, and restore the physiological anatomy of the fractured vertebrae, thereby improving patient quality of life.

Materials and methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 58 patients from 2009 to 2011 with 69 condylar neck fractures in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. The fractures were treated surgically either with a 2-cm mini-preauricular and transparotid approach in 29 patients with 36 fractures, or via endoscope-assisted intraoral, or facelift or retromandibular approaches in a control group of 29 patients with 32 fractures. The postoperative hospital stay, occlusion status, mouth opening and facial nerve and parotid gland related complications were compared between the two groups. Results: In both groups around 90% of patients had good restoration of preinjury occlusion. Postoperative mouth opening was 39.8 mm and 39.9 mm in the mini-preauricular approach and the other approaches group, respectively. Facial symmetry was achieved in all of the patients. There was no incidence of facial nerve palsy, infection or hemorrhage in the mini-preauricular group. One patient in the control group had a persistent weakness due to frontal nerve palsy.

Torsional Properties of Distal Femoral Cortical Defects	ORTHOPEDICS			English	Article							PROPHYLACTIC INTERNAL FIXATION; LONG BONES; STRENGTH REDUCTION; CANCELLOUS BONE; METASTASES; FRACTURES; FEMUR	The optimal management of pathologic long bone lesions remains a challenge in orthopedic surgery. The goal of the current study was to investigate the effect of defect depth on the torsional properties of the distal femur. A laterally placed distal metaphyseal cylindrical defect was milled in the cortex of the distal femur in 20 composite models. The proximal extent of the defects was constant. By decreasing the radius of the cylinder that intersected this predefined cord, 4 different radii defining 4 different depths of resection of the distal femur were created for testing: 17%, 33%, 50%, and 67% cortical defects, when normalized to the width of the femur at the level of resection. Each femur was mounted into a hydraulic axial/torsion materials testing machine and each specimen underwent torsional stiffness testing and torsional failure in external rotation. The specimens with less than a 33% cortical loss consistently demonstrated a superiorly oriented spiral fracture pattern, while the specimens with greater than a 50% cortical loss consistently demonstrated an inferiorly oriented transverse fracture pattern. The cortical defects were all statistically (P<.05) less stiff in torsion as the defect grew larger. There was a strong linear correlation between the mean torsional stiffness and cortical defect size (r(2)=0.977). This observation is supported by finite element analysis. The amount of femur remaining is crucial to stability. This biomechanical analysis predicts a critical loss of torsional integrity when a cortical defect approaches 50% of the width of the femur.

To our knowledge, no studies compare its relation to pedicle entry point for screw placement. We proposed to evaluate whether a valid and reliable relationship exists between the accessory process and the projected pedicle axis. Material and Methods The distance between the tip of the accessory process and the entry point of the pedicle screw was measured for 50 pedicles. The angle between this axis and the midline was measured. Interrater reliability was assessed intraclass correlation coefficient for two raters. Statistical analysis of the results was performed using SPSS. Results The mean distance between the tip of accessory process and pedicle screw entry point was 6.58 mm (SD +/- 2.05), and the mean angle between this axis and the midline was 29.4 degrees medial (SD +/- 10.08). The ICC for the two raters for the mean distance and the mean angle was 0.974 and 0.894. The calculated mean distance between the tip of the accessory process and pedicle screw entry point was 3.2 mm (SD +/- 1.3) and 5.7 mm (SD +/- 1.9) medial and cranial respectively. Conclusions The accessory process is a consistent and reliable landmark to guide pedicle screw entry point, and compliments other screw insertion techniques. To our knowledge, this is the first study in the published literature to assess this relationship.	[Kanawati, Andrew J.; Fernandes, Renan J.

Growth of the human lens in the Indian adult population: Preliminary observations	INDIAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Article						Growth; human adult; lens diameter; lens dry weight; lens thickness; lens wet weight	INTERNAL STRUCTURE; AGE-DEPENDENCE	Context: The eye lens grows throughout life by the addition of new cells inside the surrounding capsule. How this growth affects the properties of the lens is essential for understanding disorders such as cataract and presbyopia. Aims: To examine growth of the human lens in the Indian population and compare this with the growth in Western populations by measuring in vitro dimensions together with wet and dry weights. Settings and Design: The study was conducted at the research wing of a tertiary eye care center in South India and the study design was prospective. Materials and Methods: Lenses were removed from eye bank eyes and their dimensions measured with a digital caliper. They were then carefully blotted dry and weighed before being placed in 5% buffered formalin. After 1 week fixation, the lenses were dried at 80 degrees C until constant weight was achieved. The constant weight was noted as the dry weight of the lens. Statistical Analysis Used: Lens parameters were analyzed as a function of age using linear and logarithmic regression methods. Results: Data were obtained for 251 lenses, aged 16-93 years, within a median postmortem time of 22 h. Both wet and dry weights increased linearly at 1.24 and 0.44 mg/year, respectively, throughout adult life. The dimensions also increased continuously throughout this time. Conclusions: Over the age range examined, lens growth in the Indian population is very similar to that in Western populations.

Unipolar, bipolar and total hip endoprosthesis are all used. The aim of this paper is to compare the functional results of bipolar arthroplasty with that of total hip arthroplasty in a South Asian population. Materials and methods Sixty-one patients who underwent prosthetic replacement for fracture neck of femur between May 1997 and Dec 2002 were followed-up prospectively. Twenty-nine patients were treated with total hip replacement and thirty-two were treated with bipolar arthroplasty. At the time of the last follow-up, twenty-four patients had expired and seventeen could not be traced. The results in the remaining twenty are presented. Results The period of follow up ranged from 24 months to 90 months, with a mean of 58.5 months. The mean Harris Hip Score for the bipolar group was 86.93, and for the total hip group was 83.82. More than a third of our patient population died within 5 years of endoprosthetic replacement. Conclusion The functional outcome is equally good whether bipolar or total hip replacement is used, in the elderly, in a South Asian population. More than a third of our patient population expired within 5 years of prosthetic replacement; therefore it may be wise to choose the less expensive treatment modality in resource poor countries.

INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Inter-observer agreement; Intra-observer agreement; Distal radius fractures; Fernandez; AO; Universal; CT scan; Classification systems	INTEROBSERVER	Introduction: Distal radius fractures are very common upper limb injuries irrespective of the patient's age. The aim of our study is to evaluate the reliability of the three systems that are often used for their classification (AO - Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen/Association for the Study of Internal Fixation, Fernandez and Universal) and to assess the need for computed tomography (CT) scan to improve inter- and intra-observer agreement. Materials and methods: Five orthopaedic surgeons and two hand surgeons classified radiographs and CT scans of 26 patients using the Fernandez, AO and Universal systems. All data were recorded using MS Excel and Kappa statistics were performed to determine inter- and intra-observer agreement and to evaluate the role of CT scan. Results: Fair-to-moderate inter- observer agreement was noted with the use of X-rays for all classification systems. Intra-observer reproducibility did not improve with the addition of CT scans, especially for the senior hand surgeons. Conclusions: The agreement rates observed in the present study show that currently there is no classification system that is fully reproducible. Adequate experience is required for the assessment and treatment of these injuries. CT scan should be requested only by experienced hand surgeons in order to help guide treatment, as it does not significantly improve inter- and intra-observer agreement for all classification systems.

Tissue bioengineering holds the promise for additional tissue availability. Various scaffolds are currently used, whereas polyglycolic acid ( PGA), which is currently used in absorbable sutures and orthopedic pins, provides an excellent support for tissue development. Unfortunately, PGA can induce a local inflammatory response following implantation. Therefore, we investigated the molecular mechanism of inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Degraded PGA induced an acute peritonitis, characterized by neutrophil (PMN) infiltration following intraperitoneal injection in mice. Similar observations were observed using the metabolite of PGA, glycolide. Dissolved PGA or glycolide, but not native PGA, activated the classical complement pathway in human sera, as determined by classical complement pathway hemolytic assays, C3a and C5a production, and C3 and immunoglobulin deposition. To investigate whether these in vitro observations translated to in vivo findings, we used genetically engineered mice. Intraperitoneal administration of glycolide or dissolved PGA in mice deficient in C1q, factor D, C1q and factor D, or C2 and factor B demonstrated significantly reduced PMN infiltration compared to congenic controls (WT). Mice deficient in C6 also demonstrated acute peritonitis. However, treatment of WT or C6 deficient mice with a monoclonal antibody against C5 prevented the inflammatory response. These data suggest that the hydrolysis of PGA to glycolide activates the classical complement pathway. Furthermore, complement is amplified via the alternative pathway and inflammation is induced by C5a generation. Inhibition of C5a may provide a potential therapeutic approach to limit the inflammation associated with PGA-derived materials following implantation.

Materials and methods: Two different sets of plates with five, seven and nine shaft holes were applicated on 62 cadaveric femurs. Ball clay was molded onto the entire inner surfaces of the plates and then the plates were fixed to the bones using two self-locking nylon cable zip ties. The volume of ball clay sandwiched in between the plate and bone was calculated and used as a quantitative fit parameter. Data of each plate were analyzed separately. Results: Using Double Medical Technology Incorporated (TM) plates, the mean plate to bone volumes were calculated as 8.4 mL (range, 5-14 mL), 10.0 mL (range, 6-17 mL), and 13.1 mL (range, 7-25 mL) in five, seven and nine-hole plates, respectively. Using Zimmer Biomet Incorporated (TM) plates, the mean volumes were 10.5 mL (range, 6-21 mL), 12.7 mL (range, 7-22 mL) and 16.3 mL (range, 8-30 mL) in five, seven and nine-hole plates, respectively. Within each group, the measurements were significantly correlated positively with femoral length. Conclusion: Optimal fit may not be achieved in each femur using current distal femoral plate implant sets. Thus additional sizes of plates should be supplied in the implant sets.

Among the two main aims of this study, one is to pioneer the technique of dynamic finite element (FE) analysis, and the other is to compare stress distribution between two implants during walking. Materials and Methods: First, we performed an inverse dynamic analysis with optimization method using a musculoskeletal model to calculate the inter-segmental and muscular forces during walking. Second, three FE models were prepared: (I) intact hip joint, (II) fractures treated with two Hansson pins (HP), and (III) fractures with Dual SC Screws (DSCS) maintaining an angular stability. The direction and magnitude of the loadings varied continuously. Stress distribution during the walking was evaluated by using a dynamic explicit method. We examined the time-dependent von Mises stresses at two representative spots: medial cortex at the femoral neck fracture site and lateral pin (presumed) insertion holes. Results: In general, stress values are always changing during walking cycle. Regarding medial femoral neck cortex at the fracture line, intact model showed almost consistent value. Both HP model and DSCS model amounted the highest around 30 MPa. At lateral holes, highest values were 18.8, 104.0, and 63.1 MPa of intact, HP, and DSCS models, respectively. Conclusion: Thus, our analysis simulating the real walking will be useful in evaluating time-varying stress distribution to assess postoperative complication.

This causes problem with the healing process and requires that the patient undergoes another surgery. Experience and knowledge of the orthopaedic surgeon is one of the most important factors contributing to the frequency of fatigue failures. If incorrectly implanted, plates will be subjected to overloading from the start, which is convenient for crack initiation. One of the most commonly used biocompatible materials for internal bone fixation is alpha + beta titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V. Focus of this study was to simulate the behaviour of titanium alloy orthopaedic plates in the presence of cracks under four-point bending. The extended finite element method (XFEM) in ANSYS was employed for this purpose. Loads correspond to the ones occurring in human tibia during gait cycle for different body weights. Experimental investigation of tensile and fracture mechanics parameters of Ti-6Al-4V alloy was conducted on tensile testing machine and fractomate. Numerical simulation established the optimal geometry from remaining life point of view, indicating large differences between different geometries. Results also have shown that the remaining life of orthopaedic plates is strongly dependant on patients body weight (load) and that the relative differences in remaining life between compared plate geometries stay the same under different loads. Influence of corrosive environment of the human body was not taken into consideration.

This study aimed to estimate the removal rate and risk factors associated with removal. Materials and Methods: The authors designed and implemented a retrospective study. Adult patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation with titanium implants for maxillofacial fractures were included and those who returned for implant removal were identified from January 2007 to December 2016. The predictor variables were gender, age, preoperative infection, injury time, trauma cause, and fracture site. The primary outcome variable was removal of titanium implants. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were computed. Kaplan-Meier survival methods were used to estimate rate of removal. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify risk factors associated with removal. Results: Of 2,325 patients ( 1,890 men and 435 women; average age, similar to 35.49 yr) registered in this study, 163 ( 7.01%) had their titanium implants removed and 1-, 2-, and 10-year removal rates were 3, 7, and 8%, respectively. The risk factors most closely associated with removal were preoperative infection, injury by a blow from an object, obsolete fracture, and female gender. Conclusions: Routinely removing titanium implants in patients with maxillofacial fracture is not necessary. When the risk factors listed earlier are present in these patients, follow-up should be scheduled more frequently.

We hypothesize that the associated injuries are under-diagnosed, under-treated and are under-estimated in terms of their relevance to the patients final functional outcome. We hypothesize a high correlation between the associated injuries and poor functional scores. Materials: Thirty-nine displaced radial head fractures were clinically, radiologically and functionally assessed at an average of 47 months postoperatively. Demographic data, case notes, and follow up data were statistically analyzed. Pearson's correlation coefficient was performed for the associated injuries and final functional scores. Results: There were 21 type II and 18 type III radial head fractures. About 52% of Mason type II (11/21) and 94% of the Mason type III (17/18) had associated injuries. The average Mayo Elbow Performance Score for the Mason II fractures was 70 and for the Mason III was 55. There was a strong correlation between the number of associated injuries and functional scores. For Mason II injuries the Pearson correlation coefficient was r = -0.994, and for the Mason III group, r = -0-972. Conclusions: "Isolated radial head fractures" are rare. All displaced radial head fractures need thorough clinical and radiographic evaluation. The associated injuries are often unappreciated on initial diagnosis and are often under-treated. Associated injuries are strongly correlated with poor functional scores and therefore need to be addressed during surgery.

For example, hip prostheses require a porous external area that allows their fixation by means of osseointegration and a solid internal area that will be in contact with the femoral head. The manufacturing of complex ceramic shapes, by means of machining processes, for example, is complicated and can lead to breakage of the parts because of their fragility. The direct ink writing (DIW) process allows the printing of ceramic pastes into complex shapes that achieve their final strength after a heat treatment operation. This paper studies both the dimensional error and surface finish of porous zirconia prismatic parts prior to sintering. The variables considered are infill, layer height, printing speed, extrusion multiplier and bed temperature. The responses are the dimensional error of the lateral walls of the samples and an areal roughness parameter, the arithmetical mean height, Sa. Mathematical models are found for each response, and multiobjective optimization is carried out by means of the desirability function. The dimensional error depends mainly on the interaction between layer height and infill, while the roughness on the interaction between infill and printing speed. Thus, infill is an important factor for both responses. In the future, the behavior of compact printed parts will be addressed.

Material and methods We studied the stability of an ankle arthrodesis with the use of two cross-screws combined with dowel graft technique in 14 fresh-frozen ankles from amputees. The arthrodesis was performed by a dowel graft technique, in the coronal plane in 7 specimens (group 1) and in the diagonal plane in the remaining 7 (group 2). Allocation into the two groups took place after normalization according to the bone mineral content of the specimens. All ankles were fixed with two 6.5-mm diameter cancellous-bone screws, with the ankle in neutral position. Tibiotalar motion was measured during 5 Nm torque loading in plantar flexion-dorsiflexion, abduction-adduction and eversion-inversion planes of the ankle joint. Two testing sequences were performed and the mean value of both tests in each direction was used for the analysis. Results In all 3 planes, the torque applied caused more motion with the dowel graft in the coronal plane (group 1) than with the graft in the diagonal plane (group 2). The differences between the two groups were significant for abduction-adduction and eversion-inversion planes. Statistical analysis of differences between the first and second test showed significantly greater stiffness in group 2 than in group 1 in plantar flexion-dorsiflexion torque. Interpretation The placement of a dowel graft in the diagonal plane in comparison to the coronal plane significantly increased the initial stability of an ankle arthrodesis.

Treatment is often combined, using antibiotics and surgery (with radical debridement and secondary or concomitant reconstruction). One-stage management is an alternative approach, with few reported cases in literature. Patients/Material and methods We carried out an observational retrospective multicenter study to evaluate the results of one-stage reconstructions with vascularized bone flaps. We assessed bone and infection healing in 14 cases, with a mean follow-up of 63.6 months. Results: Bone union was obtained in 10 cases (71.4 %) in a mean period of 7.9 months. Nonunion occurred in 4 cases (28.6 %), 2 of them with infection persistence. Bone nonunion risk increases in polymicrobial infections (p = 0.0269) and in compromised hosts (p = 0.0110). Infection healing was achieved in 11 cases (78.6 %). Fistula recurred in 3 cases of forearm osteomyelitis (21.4 %) in 10 months on average. Infection recurrence is associated with polymicrobial infections (p = 0.0378) and is higher in internal fixation and compromised hosts with no statistically significant relation. Conclusions One-stage surgical treatment seems to be an effective approach in selected patients, in particular when an important impairment of local soft tissue and bone exposure are present, and immediate bone coverage with vascularized soft tissue is needed. Most complications occurred in compromised hosts and in patients with polymicrobial cultures. Further research, with comparison between one and two-stage procedures, is needed in order to strengthen the level of evidence.

Hypothesis: Treatment of bone and joint infection (BJI) secondary to surgery for ankle or hindfoot fracture is at high risk of failure. We analyzed results of treatment of BJI in this context. Material and methods: 33 patients (34 cases) were treated for ankle or hindfoot BJI between 2010 and 2015. Cure was defined by absence of fistula and of local or general inflammatory signs and by normal Creactive protein level, at a minimum 2 years' follow-up. Fusion without infection was counted as success; recurrent infection and amputation were counted as failure. Mean age at trauma was 52 years (range, 16-85 years). Median time to diagnosis of BJI was 44 days (range, 2-830 days). Results: Mean follow-up was 20 months (range, 3-59 months). Twenty-two patients were cured (65%). Seven cases required joint fusion (21%). The failure rate was 15%, including 5 transtibial amputations. Skin cover flap was required for 15 patients (44%), at a median 33 days (range, 0-167 days). Discussion: Despite its retrospective design and small numbers, the present study confirmed the poor prognosis of BJI following surgery for ankle and/or hindfoot fracture. Patients need to be informed of this. Type of study and level of evidence: IV, retrospective observational. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Materials and Methods: Four groups were divided according to the prosthetic connection (internal or external hexagon) and abutment type. The vertical misfit between the abutment and implant was evaluated under stereomicroscope. Next, the implants were divided into pairs and embedded in polyurethane to receive two-element prostheses. The initial removal torque was measured for abutments and for prosthesis fixation. The samples were mechanically cycled (200 N, 2 Hz, 2 x 10(6) cycles) before measuring the torque loss in the same regions. For stress verification, a finite element analysis was used. Results: For vertical misfit, one-piece (4.70 +/- 0.26 mu m) < two-piece (16.8 +/- 0.32 mu m). For preload in abutment screw, two-piece = one-piece. For prosthetic screw, a higher percentage of preload was found for two-piece, but no statistical difference was observed after fatigue cycling between the groups. For stress analysis, no difference (10%) was observed for abutments, retention screw, or for the bone. Conclusion: The one-piece abutment maintained even amounts of preload after cyclic loading and presented less vertical misfit in comparison with the two-piece abutment for both implant connections. The use of one-piece abutments did not increase the stress and strain concentration, suggesting acceptable biomechanical behavior.

Sundar; Nuuman, Jiju A.; Pattathil, Amish Sunder			Bone impregnated hip screw in femoral neck fracture Clinicoradiological results	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Bone impregnated hip screw; osteogenic; femoral neck fracture; cannulated cancellous screws	INTERTROCHANTERIC OSTEOTOMY; AVASCULAR NECROSIS; PROXIMAL FEMUR; BLOOD-FLOW; HEAD; OSTEONECROSIS; PRESSURE; GRAFT	Background: Femoral neck fractures are treated either by internal fixation or arthroplasty. Usually, cannulated cancellous screws are used for osteosynthesis of fracture neck of femur. The bone impregnated hip screw (BIHS) is an alternative implant, where osteosyntehsis is required in femoral neck fracture. Materials and Methods: The BIHS is a hollow screw with thread diameter 8.3 mm, shank diameter 6.5 mm and wall thickness 2.2 mm and holes in the shaft of the screw with diameter 2 mm, placed in a staggered fashion. Biomechanical and animal experimental studies were done. Clinical study was done in two phases: Phase 1 in a group of volunteers, only with BIHS was used in a pilot study and phase 2 comparative study was done in a group with AO cannulated screws and the other group treated with BIHS. Results: In the phase 1 study, out of 15 patients, only one patient had delayed union. In phase 2, there were 78 patients, 44 patients in BIHS showed early union, compared to the rest 34 cases of AO cannulated screws Out of 44 patients with BIHS, 41 patients had an excellent outcome, 2 had nonunions and one implant breakage was noted. Conclusions: Bone impregnated hip screw has shown to provide early solid union since it incorporates the biomechanical principles and also increases the osteogenic potential and hence, found superior to conventional cannulated cancellous screw.

Unfortunately, loss of rotation is observed when tuberosity excision is used, impairing function and patient satisfaction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the advantage of tuberosity repair in terms of the functional result. Materials and methods: We reviewed 41 patients, with a mean age at trauma of 76.9 years, at a mean follow-up of 24 months. Tuberosities were repaired in 27 patients and totally removed in the other 14 cases. Results: Two-thirds of the repaired tuberosities consolidated in anatomic position. We compared a group with tuberosity healing in anatomic position versus a group without repair and with malunion or nonunion of the tuberosities. In the first group, all sectors of motion, especially external rotation (49 degrees vs 10 degrees), were improved and both Constant scores (65 vs 50) and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores (30 vs 40) were significantly better. Conclusion: Management of complex fractures of the superior extremity of the humerus by reverse shoulder arthroplasty is an accepted approach, but such treatment is restricted to elderly patients. Shoulder rotational ability is improved by systematically repairing the tuberosities around the implant. However, their consolidation should be anatomic; otherwise, the result is impaired by the lack of rotation. Nonunion or malunion does not lead to a functional disaster, as is sometimes the case with hemiarthroplasty without tuberosity healing.

We believe that anatomical restoration of coracoclavicular ligament could best restore the function of the acromioclavicular joint. We attempted to correctly reconstruct the anatomy of the coracoclavicular ligament (trapezoid and conoid ligaments) in which the ipsilateral palmaris longus tendon and Endobutton were used as the reconstructing ligament and fixation material, respectively. Cross-sectional study. The subjects were 16 patients (15 men and one woman). The mean age at the time of the surgery was 38.6 years. The mean time of the surgery from the injury was 16.3 days. The mean duration of postoperative follow-up was one year and 5 months. The reduction in the acromioclavicular joint was complete in 10 of 16 patients. Meanwhile, the subluxation that represented less than 5 mm superior translation of the clavicle, occurred only in 5, that represented 5-10 mm superior translation in none, and the complete dislocation occurred in one patient. Concerning the range of motion, mean forward flexion was 171A degrees, mean abduction was 165A degrees, mean internal rotation was Th11, and mean horizontal adduction was 132A degrees. Pain, fatigues on the shoulder girdle, and impairments with shoulder motion on the affected side disappeared one month after surgery. Although it requires excision of the ipsilateral palmaris longus for graft, we believe that anatomical restoration of both coracoclavicular ligaments could best restore the function of the acromioclavicular joint.

Consequently, dealing with hardware removal is quite frequent when performing a total ankle arthroplasty (TAA). The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes regarding either a staged or concurrent hardware removal when performing TAA.Materials and methods 275 consecutive patients with TAA previously treated with internal fixation were retrospectively reviewed. Finally, 57 patients were enrolled based on exclusion criteria, and were differentiated into two groups considering the timing of hardware removal (staged-group A vs concurrent-group B) to compare: neurovascular and wound complications, time to recover full weight bearing, scar-tissue esthetic, and surgical time. Moreover, a subgroup comparison considering the surgical approach (single approach, minor additional approach, major additional approach) was performed between the group A and group B.Results No statistically significant difference other that longer surgical time (p < 0.05) was observed between group A and group B. When considering surgical approach subgroups, statistically significant higher surgical wound complications and revision rate were reported in group B (concurrent) major additional approach subgroup, and a statistically significant shorter time to full weight bearing was reported in group A (staged) major additional approach subgroup.Conclusions When performing TAA requiring hardware removal, no clear superiority of staged over concurrent hardware removal was observed. However, when considering a subgroup of patients requiring a separate major incision, a staged approach has shown reduced surgical time, less risk of wound complications, and shorter recovery to full weight bearing.

ANNALS OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF ENGLAND			English	Article						Hemiarthroplasty; Total hip arthroplasty; Neck of femur fracture	FEMORAL-NECK; INTERNAL-FIXATION; RISK-FACTORS; REPLACEMENT; EPIDEMIOLOGY; METAANALYSIS; VOLUME	INTRODUCTION The aim of this study was to determine the trends in national practice regarding total hip arthroplasty compared with hemiarthroplasty in fractured neck of femur between 2010 and 2016. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of NHS Digital data (England) between 2010 and 2016. 'Emergency' neck of femur fracture admissions, hemiarthroplasties and total hip arthroplasties were included. Elective total hip arthroplasties, revisions and prostheses relocations were excluded. Annual percentages for each operation were calculated. Trends were tabulated and displayed graphically for analysis. RESULTS The total number of emergency neck of femur diagnoses was 257,789. Total hip arthroplasty was performed in 2217, 2737, 3305, 3686, 3670 and 3825 patients and hemiarthroplasty was performed in 21,335, 21,744, 21,115, 21,798, 21,804 and 22,163 patients for each year between 2011 and 2016, respectively. The rate of change for total hip arthroplasty slowed from 24.54% increase/year (2011-2013) to 5.24% increase/year (2013-2016). Uncemented arthroplasties decreased over the same time period. DISCUSSION Increasing numbers of total hip arthroplasties are conducted for hip fractures; however, this trend has slowed since 2013. Possible explanations include all eligible fractures being treated with total hip arthroplasty, trauma surgeon preference for hemiarthroplasty due to lower surgical specialism or publication of individual surgeon data (National Joint Registry) which may lead to surgeons favouring hemiarthroplasties which have a lower complication rate compared to elective total hip arthroplasties.

Material and methods: Medical records and radiographs of dogs with ET (n = 21) or NET (n = 19) were retrospectively reviewed. Signalment, TPLO procedure side, meniscal treatment, surgery time, haemorrhage, pre- and postoperative tibial plateau angle, assistant, amount of rehabilitation, bone healing (cortical, osteotonny, combined healing scores), complications, limb function, recovery time and follow-up were recorded and analysed using multivariate analysis. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. I Results: Surgery time was significantly shorter with the NET (68.5 min +/- 3.4) than with the ET (87.8 min +/- 3.4) (p < 0.01). No significant differences were detected for all other evaluated factors. Soft tissue trauma was minimal and none of the dogs suffered severe haemorrhage. The bone healing scores with the NET and the ET were not significantly different (p = 0.1, p = 0.2, p = 0.1). Complications were rare, minor and not significantly different between groups (p = 0.73). Clinical relevance: The results of this in vivo study indicate that NET is a feasible technique that can be considered for the clinical setting.	[von Pfeil, D. J. F.; Edwards, M.

J	Stokbro, K; Thygesen, T				Stokbro, Kasper; Thygesen, Torben			Surgical Accuracy in Inferior Maxillary Reposition	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							EXTERNAL REFERENCE POINT; ORTHOGNATHIC SURGERY; I OSTEOTOMY; STABILITY; SIMULATION; FIXATION	Purpose: Inferior maxillary repositioning is among the least stable and least predictable orthognathic procedures. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether posterior movement occurred with inferior maxillary repositioning and to analyze potential causes. Materials and Methods: This retrospective observational study evaluated all consecutive patients treated at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the Odense University Hospital (Odense, Denmark) with inferior maxillary repositioning from 2011 to 2013. The obtained repositioning was compared with the virtual surgical plan to determine surgical accuracy. Measurements were performed at 3 dental reference points. Linear and rotational measurements were performed along and around the right, anterior, and superior axes. Measurements were compared by paired t tests. Internal correlations and confounding variables were analyzed by mixed model regression analysis. Results: Twenty patients were included for analysis. On average, the maxilla was positioned 1 mm posterior and 0.4 mm superior to the planned position. The virtual surgically planned reposition was statistically correlated with surgical accuracy. No other confounding variable influenced the outcome. Conclusion: The correlation between planned advancement and inferior repositioning suggests that inferior repositioning destabilizes the maxillary position and that a perioperative or early postoperative relapse occurs in response to the advancement. This immediate relapse of 1 mm should be considered in the virtual surgical plan to ensure that the maxilla is placed closer to the desired position. Thus, this procedure could still benefit from increased surgical precision and stability based on technologic advancements, such as positioning guides or printed patient-specific plates.

A patch test revealed a positive reaction to a titanium alloy. All symptoms subsequently disappeared after we removed the implanted titanium screws. Histopathologic examination of the tissue surrounding the screws showed macrophage infiltration in the tissue. For >1 year after removal of the titanium screws, the patient's body temperature remained <37 degrees C. These results support a diagnosis of titanium allergy in our patient. To the best of our knowledge, a long-term fever caused by an allergic reaction to mini-titanium screws of such a small size has not been reported. A review of 16 cases of titanium allergy reported in the published data confirmed that titanium allergy is extremely rare and that the clinical symptoms can vary. Titanium allergy should be suspected when a patient presents with a fever of unknown cause, delayed wound healing, dermatitis, or impaired fracture healing after internal fixation with titanium materials. A patch test for titanium or the lymphocyte transformation test could offer guidance for the clinical diagnosis of titanium allergy. Finally, we recommend that all patients should be asked whether they have a history of an allergy to any metal before surgery. (C) 2015 by the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

Noninvasive Investigation of Asymmetrically Conjoined Tripus Twins With Features of Rachipagus, Parapagus Dicephalus, and Cephalopagus	CLINICAL ANATOMY			English	Article						conjoined twins; fission and fusion; rachipagus; parapagus; cephalopagus; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); computerized tomography (CT)	HUMAN BRAIN; NEONATAL AUTOPSIES; PERINATAL AUTOPSY; FORMALIN FIXATION; RELAXATION; T-2	A hypothetical mechanism for conjoined twinning postulated by Spencer ([2003] Developmental Malformations and Clinical Implications, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, p 1476) suggests that, after separation, monovular twins fuse in one of eight predictable homologous sites. The tripus fetal specimen under study embodies characteristics of three types therefore preventing it from classification into a simple variant of any one of the eight twin types described by Spencer. The aim of this study was to reveal internal structural anomalies of the fetal specimen by using magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography. Dorsally appended to the primary twin is a secondary head mass (brain tissue and ocular globe) and two spinal columns converging at T4/T5, suggesting rachipagus twinning. The ventral orientation of the secondary twin's (right lateral) lower limb suggests parapagus twinning. The caudal divergence of the spinal columns and the presence of a secondary hemipelvis, separate from the primary pelvis, suggest cephalopagus twinning. Measurements of the long bones indicate a gestational age of similar to 2023 weeks. Secondary malformations of the primary fetal body include anencephaly, cleft palate, renal agenesis, decreased left ventricular outflow, and a prematurely terminating descending aorta. This study demonstrates the possibility of using current imaging techniques to study very old, formalin-preserved human material for documentation and scientific discussion without destroying the specimen, thus keeping it intact for posterity.

Corrosion performance of the plasma nitrided 316L stainless steel	SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	33rd International Conference on Metallurgical Coatings and Thin Films	MAY 01-05, 2006	San Diego, CA	Amer Vacuum Soc, Adv Surface Engn Div		plasma nitriding; 316 L stainless steel; corrosion resistance; medical implants	IMMERSION ION-IMPLANTATION; AISI 304-STAINLESS-STEEL; LAYER; RESISTANCE; PHASE; IMPROVEMENT; FILM	The AISI 316L stainless steel has been widely used in artificial knee or hip joints, as well as internal fixation devices. It is well known that this material has a good corrosion resistance and acceptable biocompatibility properties. Ion nitriding is a well established Process for steel hardening that can also be applied to this kind of steels with the aim of enhancing its hardness but without reducing its corrosion resistance. In this work, the effects of ion nitriding on the corrosion performance of a 316L stainless steel was evaluated in a 0.9% sodium chloride solution by using electrochemical tests such as potentiodynamic polarization and linear polarization in both nitrided and untreated AISI 316L steel condition. Surface characterization before and after corrosion testing was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with an energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS). It was shown that an ion nitriding treatment in a 25% N2-75% H2 atmosphere performed at a temperature of 410 degrees C improves the surface hardness of the AISI 316L stainless steel. However, under the experimental conditions carried out in this research, the nitrided steel is as prone to localized corrosion as the untreated one. It is considered that this behavior is mainly due to the presence of CrN, which precipitates during processing, contributing to the depletion of chromium from the adjacent matrix and leading to a galvanic corrosion mechanism.

Saravana			Anthropometric analysis of the hip joint in South Indian population using computed tomography	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Computed tomography; femoral stem; fracture implants; proximal femur	PROXIMAL FEMUR; FEMORAL GEOMETRY; MORPHOLOGY	Background: Proximal femur has a significant functional modification on erect bipedal posture. Various proximal femoral parameters were analyzed in Western literature. This information was utilized in prosthetic designing. Implants designed for Western people are used in Indian patients undergoing hip surgeries such as internal fixation and replacement arthroplasty. Materials and Methods: The study was done among 200 individuals (400 hips) with a normal hip joint after ethical committee clearance. Computed tomography scanning of proximal femur was done. Neck-shaft angle (NSA), neck width (NW), head diameter (HD), acetabular angle (AA) of sharp, horizontal offset (HO), vertical offset (VO), medullary canal diameter at the level of lesser trochanter (MD LT), and acetabular version (AV) were measured. These parameters were tabulated and compared with various populations and statistically analyzed. Results: The mean values were NSA 135 degrees, NW 27 mm, femoral HD (HD) 42.5 mm, AA of sharp 35.5 degrees, HO 37 mm, VO 46 mm, MD LT 20 mm, and AV 18.64 degrees. The values differ when compared with Western population. This study results differed when compared with other Indian studies done in Northern and Northeast Indian population. Significant differences noted in the parameters between sexes and between the sides of the hip joint. Conclusion: This study indicates that there are significant differences in anthropometric parameters of proximal femur among the South Indian population compared with Western population. Even within the Indian population, the anthropometric parameters vary region to region.	[Sengodan, Vetrivel Chezian; Sinmayanantham, Elangovan; Kumar, J.

Ion chelator (CA) as a new type of crystalline admixture could improve self-healing performance of cementitious materials by crack-healing and pore filling. The porosity of mortar was measured by vacuum saturation and pore size distribution of mortar was tested by low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF NMR). The water sorption of mortar was evaluated by water vapor adsorption desorption balance. The water transport of mortar with and without crack was tested by capillary water absorption. Based on the experimental results, the water distribution of capillary water absorption in mortar was calculated. Results showed that the pore structure of mortar was improved evidently by CA, and the pores (>1 mu m) and the total porosity in mortar containing 50 %BFS were significantly reduced. CA had no obvious effect on the water vapor diffusion coefficient of mortar, but has a significant impact on the liquid water diffusion coefficient, especially in pure cement and containing 50 % BFS mortar. The total capillary water ab-sorption and capillary absorption coefficient of mortars were reduced by CA, especially in pure cement and containing 50 % BFS mortar. The addition of CA decreased the water penetration in mortar, the reduction rates of water penetration depth in experimental groups (with CA) at 360 min were 12.4 % (100 %OPC), 6.0 % (30 %FA), 21.3 % (50 %BFS) and 10.8 % (16 %FA 24 %BFS) compared to control group (no CA). After curing for 42d, the normalized water absorption coefficients S" of cracked M100CA and M50BFS50CA were 55.1 % and 72.0 %, respectively. Ion chelator significantly improved internal pore structure and crack healing ability of the mortar containing 50 %BFS, and then delayed the water diffusion.

The development of such binder-free, self-supporting electrodes is of great significance for applications in electrocatalysis. In this work, a simple hydrothermal in situ self-assembly reaction and annealing process was developed to prepare three kinds of nickel oxide @ carbon felt (NiO@CF) nanocomposites with different morphologies. The influence of different precipitators (strong or weak bases) on the morphology of the resulting nano-sized nickel oxide nanocomposites was investigated. The microstructures of the NiO@CF samples were characterized with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). When ammonia was used as the precipitator, NiO grew vertically on the surface of the carbon felt and formed a mesoporous nanosheet-like structure (NiO NSs@CF). As an electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (e-NRR) electrode, the NiO NSs@CF sample showed an excellent NH3 yield (71.3 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1)) and Faradaic efficiency (17.9 % at -0.5 V vs. RHE) in 0.1 M Na2SO4. The good performance was attributed to the vertical interleaved mesoporous sheet-like structure (with the pore size of 15 nm and the thickness of similar to 30 nm) and the relatively high concentration of oxygen vacancies. First-principles calculations with strong on-site Coulomb interactions demonstrated that the presence of oxygen vacancy on NiO sample leads to a significantly stronger N binding over the surface, benefiting for the nitrogen gas adsorption and reduction. The e-NRR performance of this binder-free, flexible electrode material is superior to that of other reported nickel-based nanomaterials. This study highlights the potential of such binder-free carbon felt electrodes for use in e-NRR that could meet the needs of industrial production.

Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) includes reduction of the quadrilateral plate and securing its position. In this study, the concept of medial buttressing in acute and periprosthetic acetabular fractures is evaluated. Materials and methods Patients, who sustained an acetabular fracture between 2012 and 2018, in whom ORIF with a specific implant for medial buttressing was performed, were included in the study. Patients were divided in two groups; acute acetabular fractures (group 1) and periprosthetic acetabular fractures (group 2). Demographics, type of fracture, surgical approach, type of implant for medial buttressing, comorbidities, general and surgical in-hospital complications and length of hospital stay were recorded retrospectively. The following data were collected from the surviving patients by telephone interview: EQ-5D-5L, SF-8 physical and SF-8 mental before trauma and at follow-up, UCLA activity scale, Parker Mobility Score and Numeric Rating Scale. Results Forty-six patients were included in this study, 30 males (65.2%) and 16 females (34.8%). Forty patients were included group 1 and six patients in group 2. The median age of patients of group 1 was 78 years. Among them, 82.5% presented with comorbidities. Their median length of in-hospital stay was 20.5 days. 57.5% of patients suffered from in-hospital complications. The concept of medial buttressing was successful in all but one patient. ORIF together with primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) was carried out as a single stage procedure in 3 patients. Secondary THA was performed in 5 additional patients (5/37 = 13.5%) within the observation period. Among surviving patients, 79.2% were evaluated after 3 years of follow-up. Quality of life, activity level and mobility dropped importantly and were lower than the values of a German reference population. SF-8 mental did not change. The median age of patients of group 2 was 79.5 years, all of them presented with one or several comorbidities. The median length of in-hospital stay was 18.5 days. 50% of patients suffered from in-hospital complications. The concept of medial buttressing was successful in all patients. 5 of 6 patients (83.3%) could be evaluated after a median of 136 weeks. In none of these patients, secondary surgery was necessary. Quality of life, activity level and mobility importantly dropped as well in this group. SF-8 mental remained unchanged. Conclusion In geriatric acetabular fractures with involvement and medial displacement of the quadrilateral plate, medial buttressing as part of ORIF proved to be reliable. Only 13.5% of patients of group 1 needed a secondary THA within 3 years of follow-up, which is lower than in comparable studies. Despite successful surgery, quality of life, activity level and mobility dropped importantly in all patients. The loss of independence did however not influence SF-8 mental values.

So, we propose a new concept of relieving this crowding without affecting stability. Objective: To derive a threshold for coring out of internal surface of C1 posterior arch instead of complete laminectomy accompanying FMD. Methods and Material: We prospectively included nine patients with a mean age of 25.33 +/- 7.97 years, diagnosed with ACM-1 without AAD, who were operated with FMD and lax duraplasty and C1 laminectomy. The preoperative dural diameter and area covered under the dura at the level of C1 were measured and compared with the postoperative state. Results were analyzed to derive a cut-off threshold which could be drilled from the inner aspect of C1 arch. Results: The postoperative AP diameter of the dura increased statistically significantly from pre-op; however, the AP extension was less than the preoperative diameter with posterior arch included. Likewise, the area spanned by the dura increased statistically significantly from pre-op but was less than the cumulative area of dura with C1 arch included in pre-op. Analyzing all, a mean cut-off of 50.58% was achieved. Conclusion: The authors suggest FMD with partial coring (similar to 50%) of the inner part of arch of C1, instead of full-thickness laminectomy with a wider length of coring as the target, and this will serve the purpose intended, without increasing mobility.

There are a lot ofsuspected mechanisms, including mechanical friction, vascular impairment, injuryassociated with reduction, and local adhesion. However, there have been limitedreports about a closed rupture of the EPL tendon associated with a relativelylarge, displaced dorsal "beak" fracture fragment. We report about the managementoutcomes and clinical significance of closed ruptures of the EPL tendon causedby a displaced dorsal fracture fragment of beak-like appearance in DRF. Patients/Material and Methods Our study included 7 cases of a completeclosed rupture of the EPL tendon after open reduction internal fixation. Allcases showed a similar pattern involving a relatively large dorsal beak fragmentoriginating from Lister's tubercle, and we treated them with a palmar lockingplate within 7 days from the initial fracture without separate dorsal fragmentmanagement. All patients were diagnosed with a delayed EPL tendon rupture. Results The study included 5 female and 2 male patients. Mean patient agewas 59 years. In all cases we explored the extensor compartment III to verifythe exact cause of the EPL rupture. Six patients underwent an extensor indicistransfer and one patient underwent tendon grafting. Mean fragment width and length were 7.0 mm and 13.3 mm, respectively. Thefragments were dorsally elevated (mean, 2.4 mm) and distally displaced (mean,3.5 mm). At the last follow-up, the mean DASH score was 4.4. Mean thumb MP jointflexion and extension were 4 degrees and 62 degrees, respectively. Conclusion We support the possibility of EPL tendon rupture caused bydisplaced sharp Lister's tubercle fracture fragments.

The present study investigated implant survival and adverse events related to this procedure based on available Swedish registries and examined the completeness of the Swedish Elbow Arthroplasty register. Materials and methods: Patients treated in Sweden with a primary elbow replacement due to a distal humeral fracture between 1999 and 2014 were identified through 3 different registries: The Swedish Elbow Arthroplasty Register, National Board of Health and Welfare inpatient register, and local registries of all orthopedic departments. Prosthetic survival was examined using Cox regression analysis with Kaplan-Meier plots. Adverse events, defined as medical treatment of the affected elbow besides revision, were analyzed separately. The study included 406 elbows in 405 patients, and no register was complete. Results: Implant survival at 10 years was 90% (95% confidence interval, 85%-96%), but only 45 patients had an observation time of 10 years or more because 46% of the patients had died, resulting in a mean observation time of 67 (standard deviation, 47) months. An increase in the use of hemiarthroplasties and a proportional decrease of total elbow arthroplasties was detected. There were 18 revisions (4%), and 26 patients (6%) experienced an adverse event, of whom 16 (4%) required surgery. The completeness of the Swedish Elbow Arthroplasty Register regarding primary arthroplasty was 81%. Conclusion: Primary arthroplasty as treatment of distal humeral fractures produces reliable results with regards to revisions and other adverse events.

Vascularised fibula or induced membrane to treat congenital pseudarthrosis of the Tibia: A multicentre study of 18 patients with a mean 9.5-year follow-up	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia; Induced membrane technique; Vascularised fibula	RECONSTRUCTION; PSEUDARTHROSIS; RESECTION; CHILDREN; DEFECTS; NEUROFIBROMATOSIS; GRAFTS; SERIES; TUMOR	Background: The objective of this study was to compare outcomes of two surgical techniques used to treat congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT), the induced membrane technique (IM) and the transfer of the contralateral vascularised fibula (VF). Hypothesis: The IM technique produces similar outcomes to those of VF grafting in terms of healing and function, while being simpler and having a lower complication rate. Material and method: This retrospective multicentre study included 18 patients with a mean age of 2.8 years at surgery. Among them, 11 had neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The IM technique was used in 10 patients and VF grafting in 8 patients. Mean follow-up was 9.5 years (range: 5-15 years). Results: The two groups showed no significant differences for healing or the occurrence of complications such as limb length discrepancy and residual malalignment. Two patients required amputation, one in each group. The mean number of surgical procedures per patient was 4.7 in the IM group and 5 in the VF group. Discussion: Outcomes are similar with the two techniques. Although VF grafting theoretically involves a single stage, the mean number of surgical procedures was not lower than after the IM technique. The IM technique was associated with lower risks of complications and residual donor site abnormalities. Regardless of the reconstruction technique, the quality of the initial bone resection and internal fixation, particularly regarding alignment, is of the utmost importance.

However, the conventional surgical method requires the coronal approach, including a coronal incision, together with other surgical approaches, such as an intraoral incision. Therefore, surgeons often hesitate to propose this type of osteotomy, even for patients who develop severe nonsyndromic midfacial-nose hypoplasia. This report presents a new surgical approach for performing a safe Le Fort II osteotomy for nasomaxillary, midfacial corrective advancement via a solely intraoral approach. Materials and Methods: Surgery was performed with endoscopically assisted piezoelectric surgery. The osteotomized nasomaxillary Le Fort II segment was successfully protracted without aggressive down-fracture procedures with the sole intraoperative use of a rigid external distraction (RED) system, followed by internal rigid fixation, and the subsequent removal of the RED system. Seven patients (all patients were nonsyndromic, but 2 had cleft lip and palate, and an average age of 19.9 years) were included in this study. Results: The degrees of midfacial advancement at the base of nasal bone (the top edge of the modified Le Fort II segment) that was osteotomized and at maxillary point A was 8.3 mm (range 5.8 mm to 10.5 mm) and 8.5 mm (range 5.9 mm to 9.8 mm), respectively. Conclusion: This new method less invasively facilitates safe, secure, and ideal nasomaxillary midfacial protraction to yield a satisfactory resultant facial profile and favorable occlusion in patients with severe midfacial-nose hypoplasia and skeletal class III malocclusions.

Influence of dental metallic artifact from multislice CT in the assessment of simulated mandibular lesions	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ORAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Mandible; Tomography; X-ray computed; Pathology	INTERNAL-FIXATION DEVICES; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; RADIOGRAPHIC APPEARANCE; IMPLANTS; REDUCTION; DEFECTS; ALGORITHM; CARCINOMA; JAW	Objective: This study evaluated the influence of metallic dental artifacts on the accuracy of simulated mandibular lesion detection by using multislice technology. Material and Methods: Fifteen macerated mandibles were used. Perforations were done simulating bone lesions and the mandibles were subjected to axial 16 rows multislice CT images using 0.5 mm of slice thickness with 0.3 mm interval of reconstruction. Metallic dental restorations were done and the mandibles were subjected again to CT in the same protocol. The images were analyzed to detect simulated lesions in the mandibles, verifying the loci number and if there was any cortical perforation exposing medullar bone. The analysis was performed by two independent examiners using e-film software. Results: The samples without artifacts presented better results compared to the gold standard (dried mandible with perforations). In the samples without artifacts, all cortical perforation were identified and 46 loci were detected (of 51) in loci number analysis. Among the samples with artifacts, 12 lesions out of 14 were recognized regarding medullar invasion, and 40 out of 51 concerning loci number. The sensitivity in samples without artifacts was 90% and 100% regarding loci number and medullar invasion, respectively. In samples with artifacts, these values dropped to 78% and 86%, respectively. The presence of metallic restorations affected the sensitivity values of the method, but the difference was not significant (p>0.05). Conclusion: Although there were differences in the results of samples with and without artifacts, the presence of metallic restoration did not lead to misinterpretation of the final diagnosis. However, the validity of multislice CT imaging in this study was established for detection of simulated mandibular bone lesions.

Materials and methods A retrospective multi-variant analysis of an open prospective, single-armed clinical study was conducted. Patients receiving focused high-energy ESWT for a delayed healing or an apparent non-union of a humeral fracture between January 1999 and December 2015 at a single trauma center were included in the study. Bony healing was defined as cortical continuity in three of four cortices and pain-free force loading and evaluated using CT scans and clinical examination at three- and six-month follow-ups after ESWT. Results A total of 236 patients were included. N = 93 (43.8%) showed bony consolidation three months after ESWT and n = 105 (52.5%) after six months. Sub-group analysis showed significantly better healing for the proximal metaphyseal humerus (66.7% after six months, n = 42) compared to the diaphyseal region (48.1%, n = 133) and distal metaphyseal humerus (48.1%, n = 25). Regression analysis indicated significantly increased healing rates for patients of younger ages (p = 0.001) and a fracture diastasis of less than 5 mm (p = 0.002). Conclusion The findings of this study indicate that ESWT can be considered as a treatment option for a well-selected patient population despite the lower healing rates compared to other anatomical regions.

Study Design This is a retrospective case series. Materials and Methods Medical records of skeletally immature dogs ( n =25) were reviewed. The association of pin design [smooth (SP); negatively threaded (NTP)], pin insertion angles, TTAF-type, age and breed with various outcome variables was statistically evaluated. Long-term follow-up was assessed via direct examination, radiographs, questionnaires and videos. Results Mean age, weight and surgery times were 6.2 months, 9.6kg and 21minutes respectively. No major complications occurred among the 19 SP and 6 NTP; no pin broke. Seromas and patellar desmitis rates were higher with SP (11/19; 16/19) versus NTP (0/6; 2/6) ( p =0.02; 0.03). The median horizontal pin cross angles for cases without and with desmitis were 40 and 26 degrees respectively ( p =0.047). Explantation was needed in 5/19 SP and 0/6 NTP cases. The mean tibial plateau angle (TPA) changed significantly between initial (25.6 degrees) and follow-up (18.8 degrees) radiographs ( p =0.0002). Long-term outcome, obtained at a mean of 19.9 months, was excellent in all cases. Conclusion Tibial apophyseal percutaneous pinning can be considered to treat TTAF. Divergent pin placement and using NTP might reduce complications. Tibial plateau angle should be monitored until skeletal maturity has been reached. Long-term outcome post TAPP can be expected to be excellent.	[von Pfeil, Dirsko J.

Effect of Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells on Biological Healing of Allografts in Critical-sized Tibial Defects Simulated in Adult Rabbits	ANNALS ACADEMY OF MEDICINE SINGAPORE			English	Article						Adult mesenchymal stem cells; Critical-sized tibial defect; Deep frozen allografts	MARROW STROMAL CELLS; HUMAN BONE-MARROW; PROGENITOR CELLS; REPAIR; DIFFERENTIATION; CHONDROGENESIS; STRENGTH; CULTURES; GRAFTS; TISSUE	Introduction: This study evaluated the effect of autologous bone marrow derived adult Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) on the biological healing of weight bearing diaphyseal bone allograft in the tibia of adult rabbits. Materials and Methods: Forty Adult New Zealand White Rabbits divided into 3 groups (Autograft, Allograft or Allograft impregnated with MSCs) with 12 rabbits in each group were used for the study. A 1.5 cm of cortical bone segment was excised from the rabbit's right tibia. The segment was replaced by an Autograft, Allograft or Allograft loaded with MSCs, depending on which group the rabbit was assigned. Internal fixation was performed using a 9-hole Mini-compression Plate and Cerclage Wires. Rabbits were sacrificed at end of observation periods of 12, 16 and 24 weeks. Specimens procured were assessed clinically and radiologically and fixed in 10 A, buffered formalin. For each specimen, 5 pm undecalcified sections were cut and stained with Von Kossa and Toluidine Blue stains. Histomorphometery was then performed. Results: Our study showed that addition of autologous MSCs to diaphyseal allograft segments enhances and accelerates not just the union at host graft junctions and also the biological incorporation of the allograft segment as shown by Resorption Index, New-Bone Formation Index and Osteocyte Index. Conclusions: The addition of autologous MSCs to deep frozen cortical allograft segments improved the host allograft union rate and biological incorporation of diaphyseal allografts as shown by resorption activity, new bone formation and osteocyte cell counts.

ANNALS ACADEMY OF MEDICINE SINGAPORE			English	Article						Hip fracture	TOTAL HIP-ARTHROPLASTY; INTRACAPSULAR FRACTURE; INTERNAL-FIXATION; INDEPENDENT PATIENTS; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; AUSTIN-MOORE; FOLLOW-UP; FEMUR; SURVIVAL; MOBILE	Introduction: Hip hemiarthoplasties are commonly performed for displaced femoral neck fractures. Considerable differences of opinion exists regarding the choice between unipolar and bipolar designs. The main theoretical advantage of a bipolar over a unipolar prosthesis is the reduction of acetabular erosion due to movement taking place within the implant rather than at the acetabular implant interface. It is thus hypothesised that bipolar prostheses lead to better long-term functional outcomes with less complications. In this study, we aimed to compare unipolar (Moore's) and bipolar hemiarthroplasty looking specifically for differences in 1) pain and functional hip scores; 2) rates of acetabular erosion, component migration and revision surgery; and 3) rates of postoperative morbidity. Materials and Methods: Inclusion criteria were 1) age more than or equal to 65 years; 2) displaced femoral neck fracture of non-pathologic origin; 3) normal cognitive function; 4) ambulatory with or without assistive devices prior to the fracture; and 5) treated with a primary prosthetic replacement. Of the 193 patients that were available for review, 118 were in the Moore's group and 75 in the bipolar group. Postoperatively, patients were assessed with regards to pain, satisfaction, Modified Harris hip score and Oxford hip score. Standard anteroposterior pelvis and lateral hip radiographs were obtained at regular intervals. These were analysed specifically with regards to acetabular erosion and component migration. Results: There was no significant difference between a Moore's and a bipolar prosthesis regarding hip pain, functional hip scores, rates of acetabular erosion, component migration, revision surgery and complications rates. Conclusion: Use of the more expensive bipolar prosthesis in elderly and premorbidly ambulant patient is not justified.	[Ng, Dennis Z. W.; Lee, Kevin B.

Materials and Methods: This research retrospectively analyzed 146 patients with cervical spinal tuberculosis who were treated by anterior debridement, decompression, bone grafting, and instrumentation in four institutions between January 2000 and January 2015. There were 68 males and 78 females with an average age of 31.32 ? 11.69 years. All patients received chemotherapy for 18 months after surgery, and fixed by brace for 3 months. Clinical outcome, laboratory indexes and radiological results were analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of anterior approach surgery in the treatment of cervical spinal tuberculosis. Results: All cases were followed up about 18 to 52 months later (average 24 months). At the last follow-up, all patients obtained bone fusion, pain relief and neurological recovery. There was no recurrence in any of the patients, and no complications related to internal fixation. There were statistically significant differences before and after treatment in terms of Visual analog scale (VAS), Neck disability index (NDI) and Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA)(P < 0.05). During the last follow-up examination, in 83 patients with neurological deficit, 78 patients improved. The kyphosis was significantly improved postoperatively (P < 0.05). At the last follow-up, the Cobb angle had some degree of correction loss, but the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Our study suggests that one-stage anterior debridement, decompression, bone grafting, and instrumentation are safe and effective methods in the surgical management of cervical spinal tuberculosis.

Materials and Methods: We included 20 healthy eyes, 40 glaucomatous eyes of elderly patients, and 17 eyes with pathologic nystagmus. For healthy eyes, RNFL thickness measurements were obtained under 3 conditions: (1) without eye movement, fixated on the device's internal target, (2) with horizontal eye movement, and (3) with vertical eye movement during scan acquisition. Each session was performed 3 times with and without the use of the retinal tracking system. The repeatability of RNFL thickness measurements obtained with and without the retinal tracking was compared within each session and among the sessions. Results: In healthy eyes, measurements obtained without the use of a retinal tracking system showed lower repeatability when measurements were obtained with eye movements than without (P < 0.05). However, when retinal tracking system was used, measurement repeatability under conditions with eye movements was similar to that achieved without eye movement (P > 0.05) and higher than that obtained without the use of a retinal tracking system (P < 0.05). In elderly glaucomatous patients, the retinal tacking system did not significantly improve measurement repeatability during fixation (P > 0.05). In eyes with pathologic nystagmus, the tracking system did not follow eye movement and scan acquisition was not processed. Conclusions: Cirrus HD-OCT retinal tracking system may enhance RNFL thickness measurement repeatability under certain, but not all, eye movement conditions.

The study focuses on the comparison of tissue reaction to titanium and bioresorbable implants with and without postoperative irradiation on an animal model. Materials and Methods. Thirty-nine LEW/W rats were randomly assigned to experimental or control groups. One titanium and one bioresorbable screw (poly-L-lactide [PLLA] and L- and D-lactide poly-L/-lactide [PDLLA]) were implanted into the left scapulas of 24 rats. Half of them received 30 Gy to the operation site and the other half received 42 Gy. In the control groups, 3 rats received 30 Gy, and 6 rats received 42 Gy to the scapula area without operation; and 6 rats had implants inserted as in the experimental group, but received no postoperative irradiation. The scapulas were removed 14 or 30 days after irradiation and a histologic analysis was performed. Results. The host tissue reaction to titanium and PLLA-PDLLA screws without postoperative irradiation was of similar intensity. In irradiated animals, the inflammatory tissue reaction was more evident around the titanium screws than around the bioresorbable screws, irrespective of the radiation dose and of the time that elapsed from the irradiation. The reaction was more evident on the 14th day than on the 30th day after the last radiation dose (70 and 86 days after surgery, respectively). The intensity of the inflammatory tissue reaction, irrespective of the implant type, was more intense in the group irradiated with 42 Gy. Conclusions. PLLA-PDLLA implants appear to cause less tissue reaction after irradiation and could be safer reconstructive devices than titanium implants for patients undergoing surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy for cancer.

The poor bone stock often leads to secondary loss of reduction and implant failure. Therefore, the development of new implants and their biomechanical testing is essential. In a previous study, we developed and initially characterized an artificial osteoporotic bone model of the distal femur. This follow-up study was performed to characterize this model in a biomechanical comparison. We investigated two different artificial bones: five foam cortical shell (Sawbones) and 10 custom-made artificial femoral condyles. Additionally, eight human femora were used for comparison. For biomechanical testing, two intramedullary nails (distal femur nail (DFN) and supracondylar nail (SCN)) were cyclically axial loaded in an AO 33 C2 unstable distal femoral fracture model. In our testing, the artificial bone showed a decrease in the axial stiffness of 27% for the SCN and 28% for the DFN compared to the human results. Also the number of cycles for a deformation of 2.5mm was reduced by 55% (SCN) and 62% (DFN). This decrease was homogenous and caused by the relative high bone mineral density of the human specimen used. The modes of failure showed no difference between the artificial and human bones. Our customized artificial bone provides suitable results. In relation to the human bones classified as mildly osteoporotic, we assume that the biomechanical properties match to serve as an osteoporotic bone. Yet, we suggest to check transferability of the results with human material.

Material and methods: Three internal hexagon implants were linearly embedded in a polyurethane block. Microunit abutments were connected to the implants applying a torque of 20 Ncm, and prefabricated Co-Cr cylinders and plastic prosthetic cylinders were screwed onto the abutments, which received standard patterns cast in Co-Cr alloy (n=5). Four strain gauges (SG) were bonded onto the surface of the block tangentially to the implants, SG 01 mesially to implant 1, SG 02 and SG 03 mesially and distally to implant 2, respectively, and SG 04 distally to implant 3. Each metallic structure was screwed onto the abutments with a 10 Ncm torque and an axial load of 30 kg was applied at five predetermined points (A, B, C, D, E). The data obtained from the strain gauge analyses were analyzed statistically by RM ANOVA and Tukey's test, with a level of significance of p<0.05. Results: There was a significant difference for the loading point (p=0.0001), with point B generating the smallest microdeformation (239.49 mu epsilon) and point D the highest (442.77 mu epsilon). No significant difference was found for the cylinder type (p=0.748). Conclusions: It was concluded that the type of cylinder did not affect in the magnitude of microdeformation, but the axial loading location influenced this magnitude.

Joint degeneration following closed Intraarticular fracture in the mouse knee: A model of posttraumatic arthritis	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH			English	Article						cartilage; osteoarthritis; trauma; injury; inflammation	ARTICULAR-CARTILAGE; SUBCHONDRAL BONE; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; ANIMAL-MODEL; OSTEOARTHRITIS; INJURY; MENISCECTOMY; MORPHOLOGY; THICKNESS	Posttraumatic arthritis is one of the most frequent causes of disability following joint trauma. The objective of this study was to develop a model of a closed articular fracture in the mouse knee joint to quantify the temporal sequence of joint degeneration in a model of posttraumatic arthritis. Closed intraarticular fractures were created in the tibial plateau of adult mice (C57BL/6) using a computer-controlled materials testing system and a custom-built indenter tip. Tibial plateau fractures were classified and imaged over time using high-resolution digital radiography. Animals were sacrificed at 2, 4, 8, and 50 weeks following fracture, and the experimental and contralateral control limbs were harvested for histology and micro-computed tomography (microCT) analysis. By radiographic analysis, tibial plateau fractures closely resembled clinical fractures. More complex and comminuted fractures correlated to significantly higher fracture energies. Histologic analysis demonstrated progressive joint degeneration as measured by a modified Markin scale, with fibrillation and loss of proteoglycan in the articular cartilage. Subehondral bone thickening was also observed in experimental joints. The induction of a closed intraarticular fracture of the mouse tibial plateau generated a reproducible and clinically relevant joint injury that progressed to osteoarthritis-like changes by histologic and microCT evaluations. The ability to induce joint degeneration without an osteotomy or open arthrotomy provides a valuable new model for studying the natural sequelae of posttraumatic arthritis. Notably, the use ofa murine model will facilitate the use of genetically modified animals for the investigation ofspecific genes implicated in the pathology of posttraumatic arthritis.

These plates have been designed to stabilize sub-condylar and condylar neck fractures of the mandible. Material and methods: In order to apply the principles of functionally stable osteosynthesis to the mandibular condyle, i.e. to put the plate as close as possible to the tensile strain lines occurring during function, two new 4- and 9-hole 3-D trapezoidal plates were designed. Tests were conducted on fresh human mandibles before and after osteosynthesis of a standardised unilateral sub-condylar 'fracture', and a static biting exercise between the ipsilateral first molars was reproduced on a test bench. The resulting condylar fragment displacement in the sagittal plane was measured and the alterations of the condylar tensile strain lines induced by the osteosynthesis were investigated by using photoelastic strain tests. Results: None of the plates broke. No macroscopic condylar displacement was noted when assessing the quality of the primary stabilization. Strain analysis showed the ability of these 3-D plates to transmit physiological strains across the fracture tine and the absence of potentially damaging strains around the plate. Discussion: These results were accredited to the 3-D and trapezoidal features of the plates. Conclusion: The Modus TCP (R) plates experimentally fulfil the principles of functionally stable osteosynthesis in the condylar region and are able to resist physiological strains.

Materials and Methods Medical records of dogs that had a unilateral hip hemi-arthroplasty performed between 2015 and 2020 were reviewed. Data collected included follow-up orthopaedic examinations performed at 0, 2, 8 and 52 weeks postoperatively, pelvic radiography at 0, 8 and 52 weeks postoperatively and an owner questionnaire (Helsinki chronic pain index [HCPI]). Results Eleven unilateral hip hemi-arthroplasty procedures were identified. The median age at time of surgery was 3.6 years (8 months-10 years) and the median follow-up time was 13 months (range: 2 months-3 years). The HCPI for all dogs at follow-up was median 87.30 (range: 5-25). Total HCPI was<12 for 7/10 dogs and <greater than or equal to> 12 for 3 dogs. Pelvic radiographs at 1 year confirmed osteointergration of the femoral stem implant and no evidence of implant subsidence or progression of osteoarthritis. However, there was some evidence of mild lucency of the acetabular bed around the prosthetic femoral head and mild peri-acetabular sclerosis in four cases. Conclusion Hip hemi-arthroplasty provides a clinically acceptable treatment for disabling disease of the coxofemoral joint with 10/11 patients achieving acceptable short-term clinical function. Long-term assessment of the hip hemi-arthroplasty and comparison with total hip replacement is indicated.

Does compression treatment work? A randomized, controlled trial	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND EMERGENCY SURGERY			English	Article						Trauma; Ankle fracture; Wound complications; Compression treatment; Surgical site infection; Necrosis	INTERMITTENT PNEUMATIC FOOT; INTERNAL-FIXATION; COLD COMPRESSION; FRACTURES; MANAGEMENT; THERAPY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; INFECTION; IMPACT; MUSCLE	PurposeInfection rates following ankle fractures are as high as 19% in selected material and is the most common complication following this type of surgery, with potential catastrophic consequences. The purpose of this study was to test a regime of intermittent pneumatic compression, a compression bandage and a compression stocking and its effect on the rate of wound complications. The hypothesis was that compression could lower the infection rate from 20 to 5%.MethodsWe performed a randomized, controlled, non-blinded trial, including 153 adult patients with unstable ankle fractures. Patients were randomized to either compression (N=82) or elevation (N=71). Patients with open fracture, DVT, pulmonary embolism, dementia, no pedal pulse, or no Danish address were excluded. Primary endpoint was infection. Secondary endpoints were necrosis and wound dehiscence.ResultsAfter 2weeks, 1.4% (0.0;7.6) in the compression group had infection compared to 4.6% (1.0;12.9) in the control group, p=0.35. The rate of necrosis after 2weeks was 7.0% (95% CI 2.3;15.7) in the compression group compared with 26.2% (95% CI 16.0;38.5) in the elevation group, p=0.004. No difference was shown regarding wound dehiscence.ConclusionBased on this study, we cannot conclude if compression therapy prevents infection or not. This is mainly due to under-powering of the study. The effect on necrosis was in favor of compression, but the trial was not powered to show a difference regarding this endpoints and the result is thus hypothesis generating. Further research is needed before a thorough recommendation on the use of compression treatment that can be made.

The aim of this study was to analyze the long-term results of beta-TCP in patients with tibial plateau fractures. Methods: 52 patients were included in this study. All patients underwent open surgery with beta-TCP block or granulate application. After a mean follow-up of 36 months (14-64 months), the patients were reviewed. Radiography and computed-tomography were performed, while the Rasmussen score was obtained for clinical outcome. Furthermore, seven patients underwent biopsy during hardware removal, which was subsequently analyzed by histology and backscattered electron microscopy.(BSEM). Results: An excellent reduction with two millimeters or less of residual incongruity was achieved in 83% of the patients. At follow-up, no further changes occurred and no nonunions were observed. Functional outcome was good to"excellent in 82%. Four patients underwent revision surgery due to reasons unrelated to the bone substitute material. Histologic analyses indicated that new bone was built around the beta-TCP-grafts, however a complete resorption of beta-TCP was not observed. Discussion: beta-TCP combined with internal fixation represents an effective and safe treatment of tibial plateau depression fractures with good functional recovery. While its osteoconductivity seems to be successful, the biological degradation and replacement of beta-TCP is less pronounced in humans than previous animal studies have indicated.

Results: Partial head fractures (Mason type 2) (26 fractures) are usually multi-fragmented (19 of 26 [73%]) and often have small fragments by volume (32 fragments) and surface area (46 fragments) criteria. particularly when the fracture is displaced and unstable Only 4 of the 17 patients (25%) with whole-head fractures (Mason type 3) had greater than 3 fragments, but 9 of 17 fractures (69%) with 3 or fewer fragments had small fragments Conclusions: According to this initial application of quantitative 3DCT analysis, partial-head fractures are often complex and difficult to repair (small fragments). and most whole-head fractures have 3 or fewer fragments, but many of those fragments are small and may be difficult to repair Level of evidence: Level IV, Diagnostic Study.

The structure is a brick and mortar arrangement: the bricks are flat polygonal crystals of aragonite and the mortar consists of organic compounds. The biological mineralization of composites such as the molluscan shell has generally been thought to be directed by preformed organic arrays of proteins or others biopolymers. The possibility that the organic matrix behaves as a template for crystal formation by heteroepitaxial growth, is examined. The structure and growth of nacre of Pinctada margaritifera and Pinctada maxima are studied at different scales. We propose a new model in nacre growth and maturation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate biomineralization may thus provide practical routes to the synthesis of new high-performance composite materials. Nacreous shell growth was studied by electron microscopy after fixation of immature nacre. It shows that the first step in crystal formation takes place in a biofilm, as evidenced by Laser Raman Spectroscopy. This biofilm is composed of organic matrix and calcium carbonate in the aragonite crystal form. Crystalin nuclei grow in the biofilm as an aligned sequence, starting with a row of intitial nucleation centres, gradually increasing concentrically in size and fusing together to form polygons in the next highest nacreous level. In Pinctada biomineralization takes place in a biopolymer that has the ability to initiate nucleation and to control orientation in the aragonite crystal form and growth. Also is stressed the existence of several levels or steps of mineralization, simultaneously, as a key mechanism for the thickening of the shell. This natural bioceramic is studied with the aim of using it as a biomaterial in bone repair.

MEDICINA-LITHUANIA			English	Article						bunk bed; children; mechanism; fracture; surgery	EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENTS; UNITED-STATES; INJURIES; FALL; SURVEILLANCE	Background and Objectives: Falls from heights are a common mechanism of trauma in children. However, data on bunk-bed-related (BBR) fractures are scarce. We aimed to assess types of fractures and age groups most at risk for BBR fractures. Material and Methods: We analyzed medical records and imaging procedures of patients aged <18 years who sustained a bunk bed injury and were treated at our department between January 2014 and December 2021. Demographic data, including age groups, mechanisms, types and anatomical regions of fractures, were assessed. Results: A total of 162 patients (median age 5 years, range 0-15; 59.9% male) was included. Fractures were recorded in 80 (49.4%) and contusions and abrasions in 49 (30.2%) cases. BBR fractures were recorded in 44.8% of children below the age of 3, in 50.8% aged 3-5, in 58.5% aged 6-9 and in 28.6% >= 10 years. Forearm fractures were most common (n = 34, 42.5%), followed by fractures of the clavicle (n = 13, 16.3%), humerus (n = 10, 12.5%), foot (n = 8, 10.0%), hand (n = 5, 6.3%), lower leg (n = 5, 6.3%) and skull (n = 5, 6.3%). Surgery was required in 12 (15.0%) cases, including closed reduction (n = 7) and closed reduction with internal fixation (n = 5). Overall, 21 (26.3%) patients were hospitalized with a mean length of stay of 2 +/- 1.6 days. Conclusions: Caregivers should be aware that bunk beds cause a significant amount of severe trauma in children and adolescents, especially in those younger than 10 years of age. Caregivers would benefit from receiving information about these risks and evidence-based strategies to prevent BBR fractures.

In this study, the process of fracture healing was analyzed using HR-pQCT in patients with distal radius fracture who underwent osteosynthesis. Materials and methods A total of 10 fracture sites identified from four patients with a distal radius fracture who underwent internal fixation with a volar locking plate (mean age 68.8 years, all women) were investigated. HR-pQCT was performed within a week (baseline) 4, 12, and 24 weeks after fracture. Rectangular region of interest (ROI) was established in the fracture site, inner callus, and external callus area, and the changes in bone mineral density (BMD) in each region were analyzed. Results From baseline to 24 weeks post-fracture, the BMD changed from 105.5 (95% CI 98.6-113) to 428.0 (331-554) mgHA/ccm at the fracture site, from 111.0 (104-119) to 375.3 (290-486) mgHA/ccm at the inner callus area, and from 98.5 (91.6-106) to 171.6 (132-222) mgHA/ccm at the external callus area. The BMD increased at the fracture site and inner callus area, but increased only slightly at the external callus area. At 24 weeks post-fracture, the BMD at the fracture site and inner callus area was significantly higher than the external callus area. Conclusion In the healing process of postoperative distal radius fractures, increased BMD at the inner surface of the fracture site was confirmed in all fractures. Bone formation on the endosteal side may be a necessary condition for bone union of distal radius fractures.

Materials and methods In a randomized double-blind trial with internal controls, 16 patients received a dental implant coated with zoledronate and one uncoated implant as a control. The coated and uncoated implants which were visually indistinguishable were bone level titanium implants with a moderately rough surface and a microthreaded neck. ISQ values were obtained at insertion and at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks. Radiographs were obtained at insertion and at 8 weeks. The primary outcome was the difference in ISQ values between the coated implants and the control implants at 4 and 6 weeks, corrected for insertion values. The secondary outcome was loss of marginal bone level from insertion to 8 weeks. Results Implant stability quotient values remained largely constant over the 8 weeks, and there was no significant difference between coated and uncoated implants at any time point. There was 0.12 (SD 0.10) mm marginal bone loss at the control implants and 0.04 (SD 0.08) mm at the coated implants. The difference was 0.17 mm; SD 0.14; p < 0.006). On blind qualitative scoring, 13 of the 15 control implants and two of 15 coated implants showed small marginal bone defects (p = 0.003). Conclusions There were no statistically significant differences observed in ISQ values between the coated and uncoated implants during the early healing. There was less marginal bone loss at the coated implants.

The effect of distal humeral hemiarthroplasty on articular contact of the elbow	CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS			English	Article						Elbow; Hemiarthroplasty; Contact pattern; Arthroplasty; Fracture; Arthritis; Kinematics; Distal humerus	IMAGE-BASED TECHNIQUE; INTERNAL-FIXATION; JOINT CONGRUENCY; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; OPEN REDUCTION; IN-VITRO; BIOMECHANICAL ANALYSIS; FRACTURES; ARTHROPLASTY; FLEXION	Background: Hemiarthroplasty is a treatment option for selected distal humerus fractures. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of distal humeral hemiarthroplasty and implant size on elbow articular contact. We hypothesized that implants of varying sizes produce different contact patterns compared with the native elbow. Methods: Eight cadaveric arms were tested in an elbow simulator and the kinematics recorded. Three-dimensional reconstructions of bones and cartilage were generated from computed-tomography images to determine contact patterns. The native articulation was compared to optimal, oversized, and undersized implants (Latitude Anatomic Hemiarthroplasty). Changes in contact patterns relative to the native articulation were measured using total contact area and contact patch agreement scores, defined as the sum of distance between contact patches x area, indicating how well contact patches agree with the native contact pattern. Findings: The native articulation had significantly lower ulnohumeral contact patch agreement scores compared to all tested implants (P < 0.05). Mean ulnohumeral and radiocapitellar contact area decreased an average 44% (P = 0.03) and 4% (P = 0.07) following placement of an optimally sized implant. There was no effect of implant size on contact area or contact patch agreement score (P > 0.05). Interpretation: Shape differences of elbow implants relative to the native joint maybe responsible for altered contact patterns and could be improved with design modifications. These changes may predispose the elbow to arthritis. The lack of influence of implant size suggests that implant shape and materials may be more important than implant sizing during surgery.

Methods This was a single-centre cohort study at Geneva University Hospitals from 2000 to 2012 investigating the remission rates of orthopaedic implant infections after fracture repair and associated variables. Reuslts A total of 139 episodes were included: There were 51 women (37 %) and 28 immunosuppressed (20 %) patients with a median age and American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score of 51 years and 2 points, respectively. The infected implants were plates (n = 75, 54 %), nails (24, 17 %), wires (20), screws (10), cerclage cables or wires (3), hip screws (4) or material for spondylodesis (3). A pathogen was identified in 135 (97 %) cases, including Staphylococcus aureus (73, 52 %), coagulase-negative staphylococci (20), streptococci (7) and 19 Gram-negative rods. All patients underwent antibiotic treatment, and 128 (92 %) remained in remission at a median follow-up time of 2.6 years (range one to 13 years). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the plate infections were significantly associated with lower remission rates [65/75, 87 %, odds ratio (OR) 0.1, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.01-0.90]. No associations were found for gender, age, immune status, ASA score, additional surgical interventions (OR 0.4, 95 % CI 0.1-4.1) or duration of antibiotic treatment (OR 1.0, 95 % CI 0.98-1.01). Conclsions Among all infected and removed orthopaedic implants, plates were associated with slightly lower remission rates, while the overall treatment success exceeded 90 %. The duration of antibiotic therapy did not alter the outcome.

Here, we investigated whether human SVF cells directly contribute to the repair of experimental fractures in nude rats, and explored the feasibility/safety of their clinical use for augmentation of upper arm fractures in elderly individuals. Human SVF cells were loaded onto ceramic granules within fibrin gel and implanted in critical nude rat femoral fractures after locking-plate osteosynthesis, with cell-free grafts as control. After 8 weeks, only SVF-treated fractures did not fail mechanically and displayed formation of ossicles at the repair site, with vascular and bone structures formed by human cells. The same materials combined with autologous SVF cells were then used to treat low-energy proximal humeral fractures in 8 patients (64-84 years old) along with standard open reduction and internal fixation. Graft manufacturing and implantation were compatible with intraoperative settings and led to no adverse reactions, thereby verifying feasibility/safety. Biopsies of the repair tissue after up to 12 months, upon plate revision or removal, demonstrated formation of bone ossicles, structurally disconnected and morphologically distinct from osteoconducted bone, suggesting the osteogenic nature of implanted SVF cells. We demonstrate that SVF cells, without expansion or exogenous priming, can spontaneously form bone tissue and vessel structures within a fracture-microenvironment. The gained clinical insights into the biological functionality of the grafts, combined with their facile, intra-operative manufacturing modality, warrant further tests of effectiveness in larger, controlled trials.

Safe zone for the superficial femoral artery demonstrated on computed tomography angiography	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Femur; Fracture; Closed hip nailing; Iatrogenic femoral artery injury	VASCULAR INJURY; FEMUR; PSEUDOANEURYSM; INTERLOCKING; NAIL	Introduction: Internal or external fixation of the femur is common following trauma. Neurovascular structures around the shaft of the femur are at risk, particularly the superficial femoral artery (SFA). Damage to this structure, when it is medial to the femur, can occur during the lateral approach, when drills, pins or screws are inserted. This anatomical study aims to delineate a safe zone for operative intervention to the shaft of the femur with respect to the SFA, and describe the relationship between this zone and the width and length of the femur. Materials and methods: 41 limbs from 22 patients were examined using Computed Tomography Angiography to determine the relationship between the SFA and the medial shaft of the femur. The danger zone where the SFA lies medial to the shaft of the femur in the sagittal plane was identified and measured, and the width and length of the femur were measured for reference points. Results: The SFA begins anterior to the shaft of the femur proximally and passes posteriorly, crossing the shaft of the femur in the sagittal plane at points 239.6 +/- 39.8 mm and 172.5 +/- 40.9 mm proximal to the adductor tubercle (AT). The width of the femur correlates to the inferior crossing point of the SFA on the femur with a mean ratio of 1: 2.05, p = 0.000, the length of the femur correlates to the mid crossing point of the SFA on the femur with a ratio of 2.00: 1, p = 0.000. Conclusions: There is a safe zone along the medial shaft of the femur, which can be estimated intraoperatively using anatomical reference points. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

MEDLINE, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases were searched until July 2013 using combinations of the search terms: tibial plateau, fractures, and arthroscopically/arthroscopic/arthroscopy/percutaneous/minimally invasive. Inclusion criteria were observational study, patients with tibial plateau fractures, and clinical and radiological outcomes assessed using Rasmussen scoring system. The outcome measures of interest were clinical and radiological Rasmussen scores and the prevalence of secondary osteoarthritis. A total of 12 studies, 5 prospective and 7 retrospective, involving 353 patients were included in the review. The majority of patients in most studies had Schatzker type I-III fractures. The graft material used varied between studies. The length of the follow-up was typically between 34 and 38 months. Mean clinical Rasmussen scores ranged from 25.5 to 28.4. In each study, the majority (a parts per thousand yen80 %) of patients had excellent/good clinical Rasmussen scores. In each study, the majority (a parts per thousand yen63 %) of patients had excellent/good radiological Rasmussen scores. The proportion of patients who experienced secondary osteoarthritis was variable, ranging from 0 to 47.6 %. The results of this systematic review indicate that arthroscopic-assisted management of tibial plateau fractures can be effective. Surgeons should consider using this approach when treating patients with tibial plateau fractures.

This study analyzed the radiographic and functional outcomes of intramedullary nailing of forearm diaphyseal fractures in children. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis was performed of children with forearm shaft fractures and open epiphyseal plates, treated with ESIN between 2000 and 2012 in our institution. Evaluation of cases was conducted minimum 14 months after osteosynthesis. Clinical results were evaluated according to the criteria developed by Price et al. and Flynn et al. Results: The study included 88 (42 boys) children. The average age of children at day injury was 10.5 +/- 2.59 years (range 4-16), and at the review clinic was 13.4 +/- 1.85 years (range 7-18). Forty six (52.3 %) had right forearm and 42 (47.7%) had left fracture respectively. Open reduction was required in 20 (22.7%) children. Primarily surgically were treated 62 (70.5%) children and 26 (29.5%) were operated as a second procedure after failed conservative management. There was one delayed union. Rotational forearm restriction with values between 11 and 20 degrees was present in nine children. Six children developed radial nerve hypoesthesia which eventually resolved with time. After removal of the implant one child sustained a re-fracture. The overall complication rate was 25%. Complete recovery to the original condition was noted in 76 (86.4%) children, eleven children (12.5%) had good and only one (1.1%) had poor outcome. Conclusion: Our study suggests that ESIN osteosynthesis for diaphyseal forearm fractures remains a valid technique with very good functional results. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hoffmeier, KL; Hofmann, GO; Mückley, T				Hoffmeier, Konrad L.; Hofmann, Gunther O.; Mueckley, Thomas			Choosing a proper working length can improve the lifespan of locked plates A biomechanical study	CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS			English	Article						Locked plate; Implant; Working length; Fatigue; Endurance; Lifespan; Biomechanical	LOCKING COMPRESSION PLATE; INTERNAL FIXATORS; LCP; FIXATION; FEMUR	Background: It is hypothesized that the working length influences the implants fatigue behavior. However, few studies addressing this issue came to contrary results. Therefore, we tested systematically the influence of working length and implant material on the plate's endurance. Methods: We used an artificial model providing the substantial angle and length conditions of a human femur. A fracture gap of 10 mm was bridged with identical shaped plate implants made of stainless steel and grade-2 titanium. The fatigue strength was tested for a short, medium and long working length. Aiming at an implant failure within 80,000 loading cycles the upper load threshold was set to 265 N for the titanium plates and to 420 N for the steel plates. The lower load threshold was -20 N for both plates. Findings: For the steel plates there was no correlation between fatigue strength and working length. The construct stiffness did not differ at short and medium working length and was reduced by 10% (P=0.047) at long working length. For the titanium plates the fatigue strength tends to increase with the working length but this correlation was not significant (tau = 0.417, P=0.051). Further there was a negative correlation between working length and construct stiffness (tau = 0.552; P=0.01). Interpretation: The working length has no appreciable effect on the endurance of the steel plates. Compared to the grade 2-titanium plates the stainless steel plates sustain a larger amount of cyclic load. However, for the titanium plates a larger working length tends to improve the endurance.

Pressure reducing skin pie-crusting in extremity trauma: An in-vitro biomechanical study and human case series	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Skin; Pie-crusting; Meshing; Meshed advancement flaps; Wound closure; Tension; Trauma; Upper extremity; Lower extremity	INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; TISSUE; MANAGEMENT	Background: Multiple small relaxing skin incisions oriented parallel to the longitudinal axis (so-called "pie-crusting") near traumatic lacerations or surgical incisions in edematous tissue beds have been utilized to achieve primary closure when edema or skin loss would otherwise have made this difficult. Our study hopes to demonstrate (1) biomechanical evidence that pie-crusting decreases wound closure tension and (2) provide a case series with data showing clinical results. Materials and methods: This study is a biomechanical cadaveric study and retrospective small series cohort using 16 porcine limbs and 7 patients with 8 wounds in which pie-crusting was performed. An elliptical incision was made on the porcine limbs and the wound closure tension was measured with a hydraulic test machine before and after pie-crusting. The retrospective patient cohort had pie-crusting performed on traumatic wounds that were difficult to primarily close. The patient cohort was assessed by retrospective chart review examining wound dimensions before and after pie-crusting, and wound healing at final follow-up. Results: The biomechanical data showed that pie-crusting the wound with both a single and double row of incisions significantly decreased the closing tension. A single row decreased wound tension by an average of 34%. Using an average of 3.5 parallel layers of pie-crusting at the time of definitive closure all wounds in the patient cohort closed and healed well with no complications at average follow-up (average 18 months).

THE INITIAL EXPERIENCE OF INTRODUCING THE ONSTEP TECHNIQUE FOR INGUINAL HERNIA REPAIR IN A GENERAL SURGICAL DEPARTMENT	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article						Herniorrhaphy; inguinal hernia; postoperative complications; chronic pain; cohort studies; activities of daily living; surgical mesh	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; CHRONIC PAIN; MESH; FIXATION; TRIAL; PATCH; TEP	Background and Aims: A new technique for the repair of inguinal hernia, called Onstep, has been described. This technique places the mesh in the preperitoneal space medially and between the internal and external oblique muscles laterally. The Onstep technique has not yet been described outside the inventors' departments. This study was based on the first 80 patients operated by the Onstep technique in a general surgical department. The objective of the study was to investigate postoperative pain and complications following the Onstep repair of inguinal hernia. Material and Methods: A total of 80 patients, operated in our department, were followed up in the medical files and contacted by letter. Patients were asked to fill out the Inguinal Pain Questionnaire, Carolinas Comfort Scale, and the Activity Assessment Scale, in order to assess postoperative pain. Results: No perioperative complications occurred. The response rate was 85% on the mailed questionnaires. No patients had any activities they were not able to perform. Activity Assessment Scale results: 80.3% did not have substantial pain-related impairment of daily function. Carolinas Comfort Scale results: 94.8% did not have a symptomatic repair. Inguinal Pain Questionnaire results: 95.5% reported no pain or pain that was easily ignored. Conclusions: It seems from this study that the Onstep technique is a safe method for inguinal hernia repair regarding perioperative and postoperative complications. The postoperative pain seems to be equal to or lower than after the Lichtenstein technique.

Materials and methods: The glenohumeral joint of Sprague-Dawley rats was immobilized using internal fixation (immobilized group). The control group underwent a sham operation (sham group). To assess the range of motion, the glenohumeral joint angle was measured repeatedly under same torque in 6 conditions: after removal from the trunk, after removal of the outer muscles other than rotator cuff after removal of the rotator cuff muscles, and after 3 types of partial capsulotomy. The abduction angle and total rotation angles were measured. The length of the synovial intima was measured with hematoxylin-eosin stained specimens. Immunohistochemical study for type HI collagen was also performed. Results: No significant differences were found in the range of motion until all the muscles were removed. The abduction angle increased significantly after serial capsulotomy in the immobilized group. Even after the capsulotomy, however, this angle remained significantly less than that in the sham group. There was a similar trend for the total rotation angle. There was morphological change in the synovium of the immobilized group; the significant decrease of synovial length and strong staining of type III collagen. Discussion: Our results show that capsule might play important role for contracture formation. Decrease of the synovial length might reflect synovial adhesion. Strong expression in Type HI collagen might be related to joint stiffness. Conclusion: A contracture model was successfully established. Changes in the capsule and synovium might play an important role in occurrence of contracture. Level of evidence: Basic Science Study, Animal Study.

Spontaneous Dislodgement of Tunneled Dialysis Catheters after De Novo versus Over-The-Wire-Exchange Placement	JOURNAL OF VASCULAR AND INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY			English	Article							CENTRAL VENOUS CATHETERS; HEMODIALYSIS CATHETERS; VASCULAR ACCESS; INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY; PREVENTION; INFECTION; GUIDELINES; POSITION; OUTCOMES; DESIGN	Purpose: To evaluate dislodgement of tunneled dialysis catheters (TDCs) in de novo (DN) placement with ultrasound versus over-the-wire exchange (OTWE). Materials and Methods: Data were collected retrospectively on all TDC placements at this institution from 2001 to 2019 and were excluded if no removal date was recorded or if dwell time was more than 365 days. Information on TDC brand, placement, insertion/removal, and removal reason were collected. Multiple logistic regression evaluated factors associated with TDC dislodgement. DN placement and OTWE were compared for rate of dislodgement (generalized estimating equations method) and TDC dwell time (survival analysis). Results: In total, 5328 TDCs were included with 66% (3522) placed DN and 32% (1727) via OTWE. Mean dwell time was 65 +/- 72 days, and dislodgement occurred in 4% (224). TDC dislodgement rates in the DN and OTWE groups were 0.48 and 0.93 per 1000 catheter days, respectively. Brand (Ash Split vs. VectorFlow), placement technique (OTWE vs. DN), laterality (left vs. right), and site (left vs. right internal jugular vein) were significant predictors of dislodgement. OTWE placement exhibited 1.7 times the odds of dislodgement (95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.6; P = .004) compared to DN and had significantly higher probability of dislodgement across time (hazard ratio = 2.0; P <.001) compared to DN. Dislodgement rates for OTWE vs. DN were 8% vs. 3% (3 months), 13% vs. 6% (6 months), and 38% vs. 17% (1 year). Conclusions: TDC spontaneous dislodgement rates were significantly and consistently higher after OTWE compared to DN placement. These data support more careful attention to catheter fixation after OTWE placement.

Process forces, leading to chip production, produce heat in the vicinity of the drilled bore and increase the probability of necrosis phenomenon. In this article, an analytical model to predict process temperature is presented based on Sui and Sugita model. This heat transfer model is the combination of a heat equilibrium equation for tool-chip system and a heat distribution equation for the bone itself where heat generation in tool's tip is due to cutting frictional forces. In an analytical model, it is possible to use material properties of the bone and geometry of the tool; therefore, the calibration test is not necessary. In order to validate analytical model, experiments were done using bovine bone. Using response surface method, a second-order linear regression mathematical model is derived using experimental results. The effect of each individual parameter as well as their interactions on the output of the process was investigated. Within the range of the parameters studied in this article, with an increase in rotational speed, process temperature boosts up. Effect of feed rate is complicated due to the tool-bone contact time issue. While higher temperature is achieved in lower feed rates because of higher tool-bone contact time but higher temperature is observed with high feed rates due to an increase in force and friction. Optimized combination of the parameters to minimize temperature of 35.6 degrees C is tool diameter of 2.5mm, rotational speed of 500r/min and feed rate of 30mm/min. Good correlation was observed between analytical and experimental results.

Material/Methods: We enrolled 49 patients with SCS treated with either Bryan cervical ADR (18 cases) or ACDF (31 cases). Each case was evaluated preoperatively and at more than 48 months postoperatively in follow-up using the JOA, NDI, and VAS. Cervical sagittal curvature, total cervical ROM, and degree of middle segments of motion were also evaluated. MRI was used to assess adjacent segment degeneration(ASD), spinal cord compression, and signal changes. Results: The JOA, NDI, and VAS scores in the 2 groups improved significantly postoperatively. At the last follow-up, the results of Group Bryan were better than those of Group ACDF with respect to the incidence of axial symptoms (11.1% and 45.2%, respectively), VAS, ROM, and the degree of middle segments of motion. The ROM in Group Bryan was 38.2 +/- 4.6 degrees and in Group ACDF was 25.3 +/- 4.6 degrees. The middle segments of motion were 8.4 +/- 2.0 degrees in Group Bryan and 12.2 +/- 2.2 degrees in Group ACDF. There were no patients with ASD in Group Bryan. In Group ACDF, 1 case with an internal fixation device developed dislocation, and 2 cases developed degeneration, but there was no need for reoperation. Conclusions: ADR for SCS can effectively improve neurological function and retain the overall activity of the cervical, thereby reducing ASD and the incidence of postoperative axial symptoms.

Proximal row carpectomy in total arthrodesis of the rheumatoid wrist	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Wrist; Arthrodesis; Proximal row carpectomy; Rheumatoid arthritis; Synovectomy	INTERNAL-FIXATION; FOLLOW-UP; ARTHRITIS; MANNERFELT; RADIUS; PIN	Background: Advanced proximal carpal row damage is common in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Proximal row carpectomy (PRC) simplifies total wrist arthrodesis, obviating the need for an iliac bone graft. In theory, PRC also improves the chances of healing, as fusion of a single joint space is needed for the procedure to be successful. Potential effects of the loss of carpal height related to PRC are unknown. H Hypothesis: We hypothesised that PRC performed concomitantly with total wrist arthrodesis in patients with RA produces good clinical and radiological outcomes, without inducing loss of strength or digital deformities. Material and methods: In 38 total arthrodeses of rheumatoid wrists, a clinical evaluation was performed, including a visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score, the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE), grip strength, digital deformities, and patient satisfaction. A standard radiographic workup was obtainedto assess healing and carpal height indices. Results: After a mean follow-up of 50 months, the mean VAS pain score was 0.4 (range: 0-7), the mean PRWE score was 21 (range: 0-80.5), and grip strength as a percentage of the contralateral limb was 76%. The healing rate was 92% (35/ 38 wrists), and 34 (90%) patients reported being satisfied or very satisfied. No effects of carpal height loss on clinical or radiographic parameters was detected. Discussion: Total wrist arthrodesis combined with PRC provides reliable and reproducible benefits. This study found no evidence of adverse effects related to the loss of carpal height. Level of evidence: IV, retrospective study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.	[Pham, T.

Advantages of surgical treatments, such as anatomical restoration of fracture displacement, are counterbalanced by approach morbidity. We conducted a meta-analysis of 463 scapular neck fractures and compared clinical, functional, and radiographical outcomes in operatively and nonoperatively treated scapular neck fractures. Material and Methods: A literature search was conducted, including the databases PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Manuscripts were included if they reported a precise description of treatment, complications, functional outcomes, and/ or radiographic evaluation. Data about day-to-day activities, level of pain-freeness, range of motion, functional grading, and radiographical assessment were pooled and compared using fixed effects models. Results and Conclusions: A total of 22 manuscripts were relevant, including 1 prospective cohort study and 21 retrospective studies. The studies showed a high heterogeneity in the result assessment. Most patients had concomitant injuries. In total, 234 out of the 463 fractures were treated operatively. Pain-freeness and radiographic outcome measurements were significantly better in the operatively treated group, whereas range of motion was significantly improved in the nonoperative treated patients. Complication rate for surgical treatment was about 10%. From the achievable data, there was no bias detected when comparing the two treatment groups. However, those data could not be analyzed for all included studies. For the same reason, the role of additional surgical treatment for concomitant injuries to the shoulder girdle could not be cleared completely. Caution should be exercised, and individual injury patterns have to be taken into consideration when considering the best treatment options.	[Dienstknecht, T.; Horst, K.; Pishnamaz, M.; Sellei, R.

Methods: The CF-PEEK tibial nail, dynamic compression plate, proximal humeral plate and distal radius volar plate were compared biomechanically (by four-point bending, static torsion of the nail, and bending fatigue) and for wear/debris (by amount of the debris generated at the connection between the CF-PEEK plate and titanium alloy screws) to commercially available devices. Results: Four-point bending stress of the tibial nail and dynamic and distal radius plates yielded characteristics similar to other commercially available devices. The distal volar plate bending structural stiffness of the CF-PEEK distal volar plate was 0.542 Nm(2) versus 0.376 Nm(2) for the DePuy's DVR anatomic volar plate. The PHILOS proximal humeral internal locking system stainless steel plate was much stronger (6.48 Nm(2)) than the CF-PEEK proximal humeral plate (1.1 Nm(2)). Tibial nail static torsion testing showed similar properties to other tested nails (Fixion, Zimmer and Synthes). All tested CF-PEEK devices underwent one million fatigue cycles without failure. Wear test showed a lower volume of generated particles in comparison to the common implants in use today. Interpretation: Thus, these tested implants were similar to commercially used devices and can be recommended for use as implants in orthopedic surgery. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Pedobarography after subtalar bone-block distraction arthrodesis have demonstrated a more laterally shifted gait line. However pedobarographic measurements after primary in-situ isolated subtalar arthrodesis have not been reported. This is the first study considering this. Materials and Methods: Physical examination, AOFAS Hindfoot score, full weightbearing anterior/posterior and lateral radiographs were assessed in 15 feet. Peak pressures, ground reaction force and force distribution at foot-flat and push-off were measured. Results: Average AOFAS-Score significantly improved. Subjective satisfaction was high. Non-union was found in 1 foot (7%), screws were removed in 4 of the 15 feet (27%). One new asymptomatic arthritic talonavicular joint was found. The pressure and force distributions under the operated and contralateral foot showed a different pattern compared to a normal foot. Ground reaction force under both the operated and contralateral feet were lower than a normal foot. Discussion: This study found good clinical, subjective and radiographic results matching that of the reported literature. However, pedobarographic assessment suggests that great functional differences still remain when compared to a normal foot. Subtalar arthrodesis may induce an abnormal gait pattern by preventing compensation of axial rotation of the tibia. This is also reflected in the unaffected side, which may indicate an effort in the general locomotor control to keep a symmetrical gait pattern. This finally alters the pressure and force distribution under both feel. Nevertheless, subtalar arthrodesis is considered a valuable treatment for various isolated subtalar disorders.
