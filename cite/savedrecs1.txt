CT scan technology and the finite element software (ansys) were used to establish three-dimensional finite element models of five resorbable internal fixation devices in maxillary Lefort fractures. We used the model to calculate the stress of the upper jaw and internal fixation. We further analyzed the stability of fixation under four occlusions. The fixation using two bioabsorbable plates was not stable. The zygomaticomaxillary pillars fixation is more stable than other fixations. The stability of fracture fixation was influenced with the molar occlusion. The current study developed a functional three-dimensional finite element model of bioabsorbable internal fixation and compared the stability of five fixation methods for maxillary Lefort fractures. The results would facilitate the application of bioabsorbable materials in dental clinic.

Based on a common method of internal fixation after resection of spinal tumor, different models of spinal internal fixation were constructed using the lumbar vertebra of fresh domestic pigs and titanium alloy as the internal fixation system. Variations in radiation dose in the vertebral body and partial spinal cord in different types of internal fixation were studied under the same radiation condition (6 MV and 600 mGy) in different fixation models and compared with those irradiated based on the treatment planning system (TPS). Our results showed that spinal internal fixation materials have great impact on the radiation dose absorbed by spinal tumors. Under the same radiation condition, the influence of anterior internal fixation material or combined anterior and posterior approach on radiation dose at the anterior border of the vertebral body was the greatest. Regardless of the kinds of internal fixation method employed, radiation dose at the anterior border of the vertebral body was significantly different from that at other positions. Notably, the influence of posterior internal fixation material on the anterior wall of the vertebral canal was the greatest. X-ray attenuation and scattering should be taken into consideration for most patients with bone metastasis that receive fixation of metal implants. Further evaluation should then be conducted with modified TPS in order to minimize the potentially harmful effects of inappropriate radiation dose.

What are the Effects of Internal Fixation on Trigeminal Neurosensory Function and the Temporomandibular Joints Following Intraoral Vertical Ramus Osteotomy?	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							SAGITTAL SPLIT; HYPOESTHESIA; SURGERY	Purpose: Intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy (IVRO) has, traditionally, been accomplished without inter-nal fixation, necessitating a period of maxillomandibular fixation (MMF). With advances in instrumenta-tion, internal fixation of IVRO is feasible, obviating the need for MMF. The purpose is to investigate the effects of transoral internal fixation on the prevalence of third division trigeminal nerve (CNV3) injury, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthralgia, and surgical site bleeding following IVRO. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on patients who underwent IVRO at Vanderbilt University Medical Center between January 2017 and December 2020. The primary predictor variable was fixation status-internal fixation versus MMF. The primary outcome variable was postoperative CNV3 neurosensory disturbance. The secondary outcome variables were TMJ arthralgia and surgical site bleeding. Statistical analysis included Fisher's exact test and McNemar's Chi-squared test. Results: Seventy two subjects (59 IVROs without internal fixation and 65 IVROs with internal fixation) were studied. The frequency of CNV3 neurosensory deficit was 0% in the IVRO without internal fixation group and 3.1% in the IVRO with internal fixation group (P = .49). Within group analysis showed a decreased frequency of postoperative TMJ arthralgia compared to preoperative records in both groups (IVRO without internal fixation group, P = .04 and IVRO with internal fixation group, P = .004). The fre-quency of active surgical site bleeding controlled with local measures was 1.7% in the IVRO without inter-nal fixation group and 3.1% in the IVRO with internal fixation group (P = 1). Conclusion: Internal fixation of IVRO is associated with low incidence of neurosensory deficit, TMJ arthralgia, and active surgical site bleeding. & COPY; 2023 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons J Oral Maxillofac Surg 81:708-715, 2023	[Lin, Susie I.; McKenna, Samuel J.] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, Nashville, TN USA; [McKenna, Samuel J.] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr North T 4323A, Med Ctr, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, Nashville, TN 37232 USA	Vanderbilt University; Vanderbilt University	McKenna, SJ (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr North T 4323A, Med Ctr, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, Nashville, TN 37232 USA.	samuel.mckenna@vumc.org							20	0	0	0	0	W B SAUNDERS CO-ELSEVIER INC	PHILADELPHIA	1600 JOHN F KENNEDY BOULEVARD, STE 1800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2899 USA	0278-2391	1531-5053		J ORAL MAXIL SURG	J.

JOURNAL OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY			English	Article						Rib fracture; Removal of internal fixation; Implant-related complication; Postoperative complications	FLAIL CHEST	BackgroundInternal fixation for rib fractures has been widely carried out worldwide, and its surgical efficacy has been recognized. However, there is still controversy about whether implant materials need to be removed. At present, the research on this topic is still lacking at home and abroad. Therefore, in this study, the patients undergoing removal of internal fixation for rib fractures in our department within one year were followed up, to statistically analyze implant-related complications, postoperative complications and postoperative remission rate.MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on 143 patients undergoing removal of internal fixation for rib fractures from 2020 to 2021 in our center. The implant-related complications, postoperative complications and postoperative remission rate of patients with internal fixation were analyzed.ResultsIn this study, a total of 143 patients underwent removal of internal fixation, among which 73 suffered from preoperative implant-related complications (foreign-body sensation, pain, wound numbness, sense of tightness, screw slippage, chest tightness, implant rejection), and 70 had no post operative discomfort but asked for removal of internal fixation. The average interval between rib fixation and removal was 17 & PLUSMN; 9.00 (months), and the average number of removed materials was 5.29 & PLUSMN; 2.42. Postoperative complications included wound infection (n = 1) and pulmonary embolism (n = 1). of the 73 patients with preoperative implant-related complications, the mean postoperative remission rate was 82%. Among the 70 patients without preoperative discomfort, the proportion of discomforts after removal was 10%. No perioperative death occurred.ConclusionFor patients with internal fixation for rib fractures, removal of internal fixation can be considered in the case of implant-related complications after surgery. The corresponding symptoms can be relieved after removal. The removal presents low complication rate, and high safety and reliability. For patients without obvious symptoms, it is safe to retain the internal fixation in the body. For the asymptomatic patients who ask for removal of internal fixation, the possible risk of complications should be fully informed before removal.

The authors created 2 fixation models for the above fracture, and analyzed the stress and displacement in the mandible and fixation materials under 3 loading conditions. The von Mises stress of the mandible and plates peaked during lateral occlusion, and was lowest during central occlusion. In all conditions, stresses in the fixation materials did not exceed the yield stress of titanium. The inferior border of the symphyseal fracture segments showed opposing displacements, and the mandible tended to widen in the 2D fixation model. However, the fracture displacement did not exceed 150 mu m for either fixation method. The results suggested that after well reduction and fixation of condylar intracapsular fractures, either 2D or 3D fixation for symphyseal fracture can provide adequately strong fixation. Compared with 2D fixation, 3D fixation has more advantages in controlling the mandibular width and preventing the fixation materials from enduring excessive stress.

FNS was noted and popular for exhibiting excellent mechanical properties. In this study, a three-dimensional finite element method was used to analyze the FNS and optimize the design of a new type of internal fixation with four different screw heads based on the analysis results. In the results of the FNS analysis, the portion of the screw implanted into the femoral head was smaller stressed and larger displaced, material consumption was increased due to the use of two screws here. The steel plate and locking screw construction allowed for more uniform internal stress on the fixation and femur. Among the four types of screw head internal fixation, the pyramid screw head internal fixation has more balanced mechanical properties. In the comparison of the pyramid screw head internal fixation with the FNS, the stress and displacement data of the pyramid screw head internal fixation were shown to be superior. The single size design of the FNS did not have the best therapeutic effect on people whose femoral size deviates greatly from the average value, and the new type of internal fixation with adjustable length and angle could be more widely used.

Materials and Methods: From January 2006 to June 2010, 29 patients (24 males and 5 females; age 33 +/- 15 years) were included in the present prospective study. The fracture type was malar in 24 patients, midfacial in 5, isolated orbital floor blowout in 2, and frontal sinus, cranial base in 2 patients. The fractures were fixed with internal fixation devices; these were plates and screws composed of F-u-HA/PLLA. The 24 patients with malar fractures were treated with a single 4-hole L-plate or a straight plate at the infrazygomatic crest. Results: All fractures with internal fixation using devices composed of F-u-HA/PLLA healed well. All malar and midfacial fractures had satisfactory long-term stability. The follow-up examinations at 12 to 67 months after surgery showed that most patients had no complaints, although 2 patients (15%) had a foreign body reaction that was treated by implant removal, with complete symptom resolution. At 5 years after fracture fixation, 2 patients had ultrasound and 2 had radiographic evidence of residual material. An exemplar biopsy showed direct bone growth into the material. Conclusions: In patients with malar and midfacial fractures, hardware composed of the F-u-HA/PLLA composite provided reliable and satisfactory internal fixation, intraoperative handling, long-term stability, and biocompatibility. Direct bone growth into the material could be histopathologically exemplified, in contrast to previous polymer fixations that were resorbed and surrounded by a connective tissue layer. This finding indicates that long-term F-u-HA/PLLA residual material will be included into the remodeled bone, which was confirmed on long-term follow-up radiographs.

The objective of this study was to produce an antibacterial and absorbable fixation screw by adding gentamicin to silk-based materials. The antibacterial activity was assessed against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) in vitro by plate cultivation and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We also investigated the properties, such as the mechanical features, swelling properties, biocompatibility and degradation, of gentamicin-loaded silk-based screws (GSS) in vitro. The GSS showed significant bactericidal effects against S. aureus and E. coli. The antibacterial activity remained high even after 4 weeks of immersion in protease solution. In addition, the GSS maintained the remarkable mechanical properties and excellent biocompatibility of pure silk-based screws (PSS). Interestingly, after gentamicin incorporation, the degradation rate and water-absorbing capacity increased and decreased, respectively. These GSS provide both impressive material properties and antibacterial activity and have great potential for use in orthopedic implants to reduce the incidence of second surgeries.

Bioresorbable materials slowly dissolve in the human body, such that a second operation to remove the synthetic material is not needed. Bioresorbable implants have expanded the armamentarium of the surgeon, especially in the field of sports medicine. Interference screws, plates, pins, suture anchors, meniscal repair implants, and simple fracture fixation implants are the most commonly used resorbable implants for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, shoulder surgery, meniscal repair, and fracture care. However, many clinicians continue to rely on metal fixation, mainly due to the high mechanical strength and to the complications reported with some of the available resorbable implant materials. The goal of the present paper is to present an overview on the available resorbable materials and their applications with a particular focus on new developments and trends in the field.

However, mechanical strength of existing chitosan rod materials is still unsatisfactory. In this study, chitosan rods with excellent mechanical performance had been prepared via a novel solvent, i.e. LiOH/urea solvent. The bending strength of chitosan rod prepared via LiOH/urea solvent could reach 450.2 MPa, which is over 300% higher than chitosan rods prepared via acidic solvent. Reasons behind the high bending strength of chitosan rods could be summarized in two aspects. Firstly, the gelation process of chitosan LiOH/urea solution is distinct from that of traditional acidic chitosan solution, which endows the material with homogeneous network structure. Secondly, due to the state of macromolecules in the solution, centrifugation processing can generate flow orientation in the material. Resulted from unique characteristics of chitosan LiOH/urea solution, the improvement of strength had made the novel chitosan rod a promising candidate of biomedical device for bone fracture internal fixation.

Materials and methods: A retrospective case analysis was done of all patients who were treated between 2000 and 2008 in 3 level I trauma centers with temporary joint-spanning external fixation before internal fixation of an open intra-articular distal humeral fracture. Healing rates, complications, Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand ( DASH), and Smith and Cooney outcome scores were documented. Results: The study included 16 patients. Mean follow-up was 35.2 months. Fractures united after an average of 5.2 months. No complications specifically related to the external fixation occurred. The DASH outcome score averaged 15.1. Although complications occurred in 12 patients ( 9 patients requiring surgery), 10 of 16 had an excellent/good outcome score. Conclusions: Temporary joint-spanning external fixation before internal fixation of open intra-articular distal humeral fractures is a safe adjunct.

The goal of our study was to evaluate stability of internal fixation with a plate compared to external fixation in an opening wedge high tibial osteotomy model. Significance. To our knowledge, this is the only study to compare internal plate to external fixation in an opening wedge osteotomy model. The design of this cadaver study limits its direct application to clinical practice. Material and method. In each of the six pairs of fresh-frozen human cadaver knees one specimen was randomly assigned to internal plate fixation while the other was stabilized with an external fixation. The osteosynthesis plate incorporated a 12.5 mm block that distracted the medial tibial cortices. Each knee was loaded on a mechanical testing machine to 700 N for 10,000 cycles to simulate immediate full weight bearing in a walking individual. Summary of results. The internal plate osteosynthesis provided significantly greater stiffness and smaller loss of correction (1.60 mm) than the external fixation (3.22 mm) under cyclic loading condition (P < 0.05). For static loading, the mean value of stiffness resulting in failure for the internal plate and external fixation, were respectively, 938 N/mm and 459 N/mm. Load to failure also showed two times greater stiffness in the plate osteosynthesis group. No hardware failure was observed in either construct. Discussion and conclusion. Plate fixation was superior to external fixation in maintaining correction. However, progressive adjustment of the distraction with the external fixator allows precise "fine-tuning" during the healing process that is not possible with internal fixation.

Surgeons often find it difficult to retain the achieved correction till the end of internal fixation. To maintain precise correction we used hybrid technique which uses both external and internal fixation.The objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this hybrid technique in achieving and retaining desired correction. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, we evaluated the magnitude of deformity with radiological parameters. We compared correction which was planned and correction which was achieved. The technique was used during surgery for corrective osteotomies. Before carrying out the osteotomy, rail fixator with two swivel clamps was applied. After osteotomy swivel clamps were loosened. Desired correction was achieved. While fixator held the fragments in corrected position, definitive internal fixation was carried out. External fixator was removed after completion of internal fixation. Position of mechanical axis ratio, mechanical lateral distal femoral angle and mechanical medial proximal tibial angle were measured before and 12 weeks after surgery. Student t-test was used to analyze the difference between correction which was planned and correction which was achieved. Results: There was no statistical difference between the desired correction and the correction achieved. Conclusions: Temporary use of external fixator while correcting angular deformities of lower limb allows to achieve accurate correction.

Preliminary investigations for the production of degradable fiber reinforced polymer composite materials are detailed. Composites were produced of phosphate invert glass fibers of the glass system P(2)O(5)-CaO-MgO-Na(2)O-TiO(2), which showed a low solubility in previous work. The fibers were embedded into a matrix of a degradable organic polymer network based on methacrylate-modified oligolactide. Fracture behavior, bending strength and elastic modulus were evaluated during 3-point bending tests and the fracture surface of the composites was investigated using a scanning electron microscope. Short-term biocompatibility was tested in an FDA/EtBr viability assay using MC3T3-E1 murine pre-osteoblast cells and showed a good cell compatibility of the composite materials. Results suggested that these composite materials are biocompatible and show mechanical properties which are of interest for the production of degradable bone fixation devices.

J	Li, LJ; Tian, W				Li, Lijun; Tian, Wei			Displaced avulsion fractures of the posterior cruciate ligament: Treated by stellate steel plate fixation	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Posterior cruciate ligament; stellate steel plate; avulsion fracture posterior cruciate ligament	ARTHROSCOPIC SUTURE FIXATION; TIBIAL ATTACHMENT; RECONSTRUCTION; ANATOMY	Background: The open reduction with internal fixation is an effective approach for treatment of avulsion fracture of posterior cruciate ligament. The previously used internal fixation materials including hollow screws, absorbable screw, tension bands and sutures have great defects such as insufficient fixation strength, susceptibility to re-fracture, etc. Stellate steel plate is novel material for internal fixation which has unique gear-like structure design. We used stellate steel plate for treatment of displaced avulsion fractures of posterior cruciate ligament in this study. Materials and Methods: 14 patients (9 men, 5 women; aged, 19-35 years; mean age, 28 years) with displaced avulsion fractures of the tibial insertion of the posterior cruciate ligament were retrospectively analyzed between June 2009 and June 2011. The mean duration from injury to the operation was 8.3 days (range 6-15 days). All the patients were treated with open reduction and internal fixation of a stellate steel plate (DePuy, Raynham, MA 02767, USA). The Lysholm-Tegner knee function score criteria were used to analyze results. Results: The mean followup was 24.6 months (range 18-32 months). After 6 months, all the fractures healed and knee joint activity was normal, with no knee stiffness or instability. The Lysholm-Tegner scores were 97.1 +/- 1.7 points at the final followup. Conclusion: Owing to its unique gear structure, the stellate steel plate design can effectively fix an avulsion fracture block and it is a simple operation with short postoperative rehabilitation time and firm fixation.

The increased material degradation rate can affect the strength of early internal fixation, resulting in internal fixation failure. This study sought to adjust the gentamicin concentration to control the material degradation rate, thereby better meeting clinical application requirements. The in vitro degradation, water absorption rate, and expansion rate of silk-based materials containing different gentamicin concentrations were studied. A gentamicin-loaded silk-based screw was implanted into the femurs of New Zealand rabbits. Micro-computed tomography was used to measure the screw diameter, which was then used to calculate the degradation rate. The specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome. The in vitro results revealed increasing material degradation rates with increasing gentamicin concentration but no significant differences in water absorption rates with different gentamicin concentrations. The degradation rates of gentamicin-loaded (4 mg/g) silk-based rod-like materials were approximately 11.08% at three months in vitro and 9.4% in the animal experiment. The time for complete degradation was predicted from the fitting curve to be approximately 16 months. No inflammatory hyperplasia was observed in bone or soft tissue. The degradation and biocompatibility of the material containing 4 mg/g gentamicin meet clinical application requirements, and previous experimental results demonstrate good antibacterial performance of materials containing this gentamicin concentration.

Locked internal fixation minimizes biologic damage and when used in conjunction with minimally invasive approaches may optimize fracture healing. Some current metal locked plate constructs may actually be too stiff, and various methods including screw modification, plate hole modification, and changes in plate material composition may provide a solution to optimize fracture healing.

On-table decision-making in intracapsular hip fracture surgery: mid-term results of a pilot study	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Intracapsular hip fracture; Decision-making; Arthroplasty; Hemiarthroplasty; Internal fixation	FEMORAL-NECK FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; ANTERIOR APPROACH; RISK-FACTORS; FAILURE; HEMIARTHROPLASTY; CLASSIFICATION; ARTHROPLASTY; METAANALYSIS	Introduction At the present time, it is generally recommended to use hip replacement in dislocated fractures to avoid failure after internal fixation. A problem is that previous research has demonstrated that observers have problems in discriminating between dislocated and undislocated fractures. A possible solution to this problem would be to use arthroplasty in the majority of the cases. However, this also means that many fractures with the potential for uneventful healing would be replaced. Materials and methods In the current investigation, the mid-term outcome was recorded for patients with intracapsular hip fractures who were treated with either internal fixation or arthroplasty. A novel treatment algorithm was employed. After careful exclusion of cases with known risk factors for failure after internal fixation, a technique called on-table decision was used to identify suitable patients for internal fixation. Results A total of 72 patients with intracapsular hip fractures were studied with a median follow-up time of 12 months (IQR 8-15.25 months). Nineteen (19) patients (26 %) were excluded in the selection process, leaving 53 (74 %) for ontable decision-making. Thirty patients (42 %) were identified as suitable for internal fixation and gave anatomically stable closed reductions. Two of these patients (7 %) exhibited non-unions and one (3 %) avascular necrosis. Conclusions The mid-term outcome after internal fixation is promising. The careful selection process may be helpful in identifying fracture patterns for which internal fixation may be considered as a safe and less invasive alternative to hip arthroplasty.

Open reduction and internal fixation without rigid maxillomandibular fixation: evidence based or merely a surgical dictum? A comparative pilot study on 24 cases	EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Mandibular Fractures; Internal fixators; Maxillary; fractures; Open fracture reduction; Fracture fixation; Maxillo-mandibular fixation; Intermaxillary fixation	CLOSED TREATMENT; NONSURGICAL TREATMENT; MANDIBULAR FRACTURE; CONDYLAR FRACTURE; PROVIDE	OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the results and immediate postoperative complications following open reduction and internal fixation of mandibular fractures with or without postoperative maxillo-mandibular fixation MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study spanned over a period of 24 months, extending from October 2015 to October 2017. The study sample comprised 24 subjects between the age range of 18 to 65 years. They were randomly divided into two groups: Group A included subjects in whom open reduction and internal fixation was followed by maxilla-mandibular fixation for 15 days, and Group B subjects in whom only open reduction and internal fixation was done, followed by immediate mobilization. The outcomes evaluated were swelling, pain, simplified oral hygiene index and occlusion. The subjects were followed for all these outcomes on 1st, 7th and 15th days. The occlusion was assessed for 5 days. Any other intra/post- operative complications were additionally noted. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference between the groups for swelling, pain and occlusion. The patients with postoperative maxilla-mandibular fixation had poorer oral hygiene when compared to the other group (p< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The use of maxilla-mandibular fixation post open reduction and internal fixation seems to offer no additional benefits to the patients. According to the results of the study, this traditional surgical dictum seems to be used by the surgeons due to the lack of any scientific evidence. However, further studies should be conducted to confirm this statement.

This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of internal fixation compared with hemiarthroplasty (HA) for elderly patients with displaced femoral neck fractures. Materials and Methods: A total of 121 patients >= 65 years old were divided into internal fixation (n = 58) or HA group (n = 63). Clinical outcome was evaluated by the EuroQol 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) score at 3, 12, and 24 months. The total costs including medical and non-medical expense were collected through hospitalisation information, cost diaries, and telephone interviews. A cost-utility analysis of the total costs in combination with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) calculated by EQ-5D and survival time was conducted. Results were expressed in incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results: The mean EQ-5D index score in the HA group were higher at the early follow-up (p<0.05). At 24 months there were no differences in EQ-5D between the 2 treatment groups (p>0.05). Over the 2-year period, patients treated with HA gained 0.09-0.10 more QALYs than those treated with internal fixation, while the mean total costs for internal fixation (CNY 55,676) were significantly lower than for HA (CNY 80,297) (P<0.001). ICER indicated that internal fixation may be more cost-effective than HA. Conclusion: HA is associated with better outcome than internal fixation in the treatment of displaced femoral neck fractures in elderly patients. However, internal fixation may be more cost-effective because of less total cost. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Intracapsular fractures of the femoral neck account for a major share of fractures in the elderly. Open reduction and internal fixation has been shown to have a higher rate of revision surgery than arthroplasty. The aim of this study was to assess and compare the rates of revision surgery performed after internal fixation and primary total hip arthroplasty. Material and Methods. Between 2004 and 2006, 681 intracapsular femoral neck fractures in 679 consecutive patients were treated with internal fixation or total hip arthroplasty at our institution. Revision surgery rates were evaluated at 1-, 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up. Results. There was no significant difference in the ratio of internal fixation to total hip arthroplasty during 2004-2006 (P=0.31). The mean rate of total hip arthroplasty was 19.1% with a lower rate being among patients younger than 60 years. Revision surgery rates at the 2-year follow-up were higher in the internal fixation group compared with total hip arthroplasty group (28.9% vs. 7.0%, P<0.001). Patients who underwent internal fixation were at a 4-fold greater risk of having revision surgery at the 2-year follow-up than those who underwent total hip arthroplasty (odds ratio, 4.11; 95% CI, 1.95-8.65; P<0.001). Age was a significant risk factor for revision surgery after total hip arthroplasty (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-0.98; P=0.02), but not significant after the internal fixation (P=0.86). Conclusions. Higher revision surgery rates after internal fixation favors arthroplasty as a primary choice of treatment for the femoral neck fractures.

Biomechanical Comparison of Suture-External Button Fixation vs Internal Suspension Fixation for Tendon Transfers of the Feet	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						tendon transfer fixation; button; EndoButton; suture anchor	BONE TUNNEL; ANTERIOR; SCREW; RECONSTRUCTION; DEVICES; ANCHOR; ANKLE	Background: Fixation of tendon transfers in pediatric feet typically involves passing a suture that is secured to a tendon, through an intraosseous tunnel, and tying it over an external button on the plantar foot, with appropriate tension. After adequate time is allowed for bone-tendon healing, the suture and button are removed. This construct can be complicated by suture breakage with loss of fixation, and/or skin ulceration under the button. Internal suspension systems of tendons and ligaments in adults have demonstrated excellent fixation strength and minimal intraosseous tunnel displacement, with no risk of skin ulceration and no need for suture and button removal. This study compared the biomechanical properties of the suture-external button and internal suspension fixation techniques in cadavers. The primary outcome and secondary outcomes were displacement of suture-fixation construct during dynamic loading, and static loading, respectively. Methods: Nine adult cadaver feet were obtained. Both the external button and internal suspension techniques were tested once in each cadaver, in random order. Relative displacement of the fixation construct within the bone tunnel was recorded with video capture during dynamic and static loading. A custom Matlab script processed video and materials testing data. Static and cyclic displacements were analyzed between fixation groups using a paired t test (alpha value =0.05). Results: Internal suspension fixation had significantly less mean displacement of the tendon within the bone tunnel than the external button technique during dynamic (0.3 mm internal suspension system, 0.7 mm external button, P = .0115) and static loading (0.4 mm internal suspension system, 2.2 mm external button, P = .0019). Conclusions: Internal suspension systems may provide superior fixation compared to the traditional external button for tendon transfers, with the added benefit of avoiding the risk of skin ulceration and the need for suture and button removal.

Stability of internal versus external fixation in osteoporotic pelvic fractures - a biomechanical analysis	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Fragility fracture of the pelvis; Pelvic ring injury; Osteoporosis; Internal fixator; External fixator	RING INJURIES; REDUCTION	Introduction: Osteoporosis-related fragility fractures of the pelvic ring (FFP) differ fundamentally from pelvic fractures in younger patients. However, very little is known about biomechanical stability of different osteosynthesis procedures addressing the anterior pelvic ring in these fractures. The aim of this study was to compare standard external fixation with internal fixation using a novel screw-and-rod system in osteoporotic fractures of the pelvic ring in terms of stiffness, plastic deformation and maximum load under cyclic loading in a human cadaveric model. Materials and Methods: A total of 18 embalmed osteoporotic cadaver pelvis specimens were randomized based on the T-score into a group for external fixation and a group for internal fixation. FFP typeIIB fractures were created. In addition to the external or internal fixator, a cement-augmented sacroiliac screw was implanted. Afterwards, axial cyclic loading was performed in a testing setup simulating one-leg stand. Results: Mean plastic deformation and stiffness both were significantly better in the internal fixation group than in the external fixation group (plastic deformation: 0.37 mm (SD: 0.23) versus 0.71 mm (SD: 0.26), p = 0.011; stiffness: 43.69 N/mm (SD: 18.39) versus 26.52 N/mm (SD: 9.76), p = 0.029). Maximum load did not differ significantly between internal fixator (506.3 N; SD: 129.4) and external fixator (461.1 N; SD: 147.4) (p = 0.515). Conclusions: Submuscular internal fixation might be an interesting alternative to external fixation in clinical practice because of better biomechanical properties as well as several advantages in clinical use.

Hence, we performed this study to investigate whether open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) is superior to external fixations combined with limited internal fixations (EFLIF). Material/Methods: From January 2012 to October 2013, a total of 78 patients were included. Twenty-six patients underwent EFLIF and 52 patients underwent ORIF. All subjects were followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. All outcomes and complications were recorded. Results: No statistical differences were observed in Mazur score or ROM between the 2 groups. There were significant differences between the 2 groups in hospital stay (P<0.001), reduction results (P=0.019), screw loosening (P=0.025), and traumatic arthritis (P=0.037). Conclusions: Similar functional outcomes were achieved in EFLIF and ORIF groups. Due to several limitations of this study, a well-designed randomized controlled trial involving more patients and long-term follow-up is needed to find an optimal treatment protocol.

However, the ideal number and locations of internal fixation points to maintain stable reduction remain controversial. Using 3-dimensional computed tomography, we aimed to compare the stability of 2-point and 3-point fixation among patients who had undergone surgical repair of zygomatic bone fractures. Methods: The study included 22 patients (17 men, 5 women) with unilateral zygomatic bone fractures who had undergone open reduction with 2-point or three-point fixation using biodegradable materials (11 patients in each group). The authors measured the lateral projection and height of the zygoma at 2 landmark points (zygomaticofacial foramen and frontozygomatic suture). In each group, bony displacement was analyzed between the preoperative and immediate postoperative phases, and between the preoperative and follow-up phases. Differences in stability between the 2 groups were analyzed by comparing values between the immediate postoperative and follow-up phases. Results: The 2-point group exhibited a lower rate of complex fractures at the frontozygomatic suture than the 3-point group (18.2%, 63.6%, respectively). In both groups, the authors observed significant differences in the lateral projection of the zygomaticofacial foramen between the preoperative and immediate postoperative phases, and between the preoperative and follow-up phases. No significant differences in stability were observed between the groups. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that 2-point fixation of the zygoma with biodegradable materials is as stable as 3-point fixation. It could be initially considered when open reduction of frontozygomatic suture was not essential.

J	Jin, ST; Wang, L; Zhou, SW				Jin, Songtao; Wang, Lei; Zhou, Shiwei			RETRACTED: Clinical Study on Different Methods of Internal Fixation for Treatment of Lisfranc Joint Injury (Retracted Article)	EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE			English	Article; Retracted Publication								The Lisfranc joints are mainly used to connect the forefoot and midfoot and maintain the stability of the arch of the foot. It is an important part of the arch of the foot. If the Lisfranc joints injury is not treated in time, it will cause poor walking, pain in the back of the foot, and even deformity or disability of the forefoot. The common treatment method is to select the Kirschner wires, screws, or steel plates for incisional repositioning internal fixation surgery. In our study, we used different materials to perform fixation surgery on Lisfranc joint injury patients. We measured the joint recovery, pain condition, complications, and biomechanical indexes of different groups of patients after the operation. The results of the study showed that compared with Kirschner wire and screw internal fixation, the use of shaped arch bridge-type microsteel plate internal fixation for the treatment of metatarsotarsal joint injury patients has better foot function recovery, fewer complications, and more reliable biomechanical strength.

Aims How to obtain a preoperative internal fixation plate model before cutting muscle has become a critical issue. Materials and Methods In this paper, we present a new personalized modeling system for internal fixation plates in long bone fracture surgery. This system can achieve straight semi-automatic processing from CT images to 3D models. First, broken bones are separated in CT images. Second, the axes of long broken bones are extracted using 3D models. Third, the vertices on the broken bone cross-sections are segmented. Fourth, rough alignment and fine registration are implemented. Results An internal fixation plate is reconstructed for a long bone fracture. Discussion Three validations indicate that this method framework is reasonable and feasible. Conclusion This system can provide technical support for the personalized, minimally invasive and accurate operation on long bone fractures.

Material and methods: We retrospectively radiological studied 62 patients who underwent ankle arthrodesis with Ilizarov external fixator stabilization (group 1, n = 29) or internal stabilization (group 2, n = 33) from 2006 to 2015. Radiologic outcomes were mesure by: (1) rate of union, (2) rate of adjacent-joint arthritis, (3) malalignment of the ankle joint. The Levene's test, Mann-Whitney U test and Students t-test were used to the statistical analyses. Results: Ankle fusion was achieved in 100% of patients treated with external fixation and in 88% with internal stabilization. Desired frontal plane alignment was achieved in 100% of patients with external fixation and 76% with internal stabilization. Desired sagittal plane alignment was achieved in 100% of external fixation and 85% of internal stabilization. A total of 14 (48.3%) patients from group 1 showed a radiographic evidence of pre-existing adjacent-joint OA. The radiographic evidence of pre-existing adjacent-joint OA was also found in 27(81.8%) subjects from group 2. Alterations of adjacent joints were also found on postoperative radiograms of 19 (65.5%) patients subjected to Ilizarov fixation and in all 33 patients from group 2. Discusion: Ilizarov fixation of ankle arthrodesis is associated with lower prevalence of adjacent-joint OA and ankle joint misalignment, and with higher fusion rates than after internal fixation. Although achieving a complex ankle fusion is generally challenging, radiological outcomes after fixation with the Ilizarov apparatus are better than after internal stabilization.

Copolymers of poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) and polyglycolic acid (PGA) seem to offer better biocompatibility than other materials. One of our patients had a midfacial fracture, which we fixed using a resorbable system based on PLLA-PGA (82%-18%); a foreign body reaction developed after 22 months. When resorbable materials are used it is essential to be aware specifically of the risk of foreign body reactions, especially when the facial area is involved. This risk must be discussed with the patient in some detail during the preoperative period.

Thus, laryngeal fractures that are not appropriately managed may lead to permanent dyspnea, dysphagia, and voice disorders. In cases of laryngeal fractures, surgical repair by internal fixation has been performed with materials such as thread, steel wire, and titanium miniplates. However, thyroid and cricoid cartilage have a complicated morphology, and ossification at each site in the cartilage is not uniform; thus, in some cases it is difficult to perform internal fixation with conventional methods. In this case report, we describe two patients who underwent successful fixation of fractures in their laryngeal cartilage after trauma by using titanium mesh with thread and screws. Since optimal reduction and fixation of fractured laryngeal cartilage cannot be performed with conventional methods in patients with unossified cartilage, titanium mesh may be considered a safe and reliable alternative.

Nonetheless, orbital floor reconstruction using alloplastic materials without reducing the number of bone fragments is the most frequently used procedure. Therefore, this study analyzed and compared the outcomes between open reduction and internal fixation using absorbable mesh plates and screws, and orbital floor reconstruction, by measuring the orbital volume before and after surgery. Method: Among patients with orbital floor blowout fractures, this study was conducted on 28 patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation, and 27 patients who underwent orbital floor reconstruction from December 2008 to September 2015. The mechanism of injury, ophthalmic symptoms before and after surgery, and the degree of enophthalmos were examined; subsequently, the volumes of the affected and unaffected sides were measured before and after surgery based on computed tomography images. This study compared the degree of recovery in the correction rate of the orbital volume, ophthalmic symptoms, and enophthalmos between the 2 groups. Result: The patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation, and the patients who underwent orbital floor reconstruction showed average correction rates of 100.36% and 105.24%, respectively. Open reduction and internal fixation showed statistically, significantly superior treatment outcomes compared with orbital floor reconstruction. The ophthalmic symptoms and incidence of enophthalmos completely resolved in both groups. Conclusion: For orbital floor blowout fractures, open reduction and internal fixation using absorbable mesh plates and screws was a feasible alternative to orbital floor reconstruction.

Manual Reduction of Mandibular Fractures Before Internal Fixation Leads to Shorter Operative Duration and Equivalent Outcomes When Compared With Reduction With Intermaxillary Fixation	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							WIRE FIXATION; ARCH BARS; MANAGEMENT; MANDIBLES; SURGERY; SCREWS	Purpose: Open reduction of mandibular fractures before internal fixation is most commonly performed by 1 of 2 methods: intermaxillary fixation (IMF) or manual reduction. There are risks to both patient and clinician associated with using IMF. Furthermore, previous retrospective studies have failed to show any advantage in its use. The purpose of this study was to directly compare the use of manual reduction (experimental group) and IMF (control group) in open reduction-internal fixation of mandibular fractures. Materials and Methods: Patients who presented with isolated mandibular fractures at 2 hospitals in Queensland, Australia, from May 2009 to June 2010 were enrolled in a prospective controlled trial comparing IMF and manual reduction. The outcome measures were operative duration (primary outcome), as well as radiographic outcome, occlusal outcome, and complications (secondary outcomes). The patient and assessor were blinded to the type of reduction used before fixation. The study hypothesis is that manual reduction allows internal fixation in a shorter time than IMF with an equivalent outcome. Results: We recruited 50 patients, 26 allocated to IMF and 24 allocated to manual reduction before internal fixation of mandibular fractures. IMF was associated with an increased duration of procedure (P < .001) and increased complication rate (P = .063), without any observable benefit with regard to either radiographic outcome or occlusal outcome. Conclusions: IMF is not required in open reduction-internal fixation of mandibular fractures that met our inclusion criteria. IMF is associated with increased costs to the health service and risks to both the patient and clinician. (C) 2012 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, once bone union is complete, such fixation material becomes unnecessary or even harmful. Resorbable magnesium materials have been available for several years (WE43 alloy). The aim of this study was to clinically compare magnesium versus titanium open reduction and rigid fixations in mandible condylar heads. Ten patients were treated for fractures of the mandibular head with magnesium headless compression screws (2.3 mm in diameter), and 11 patients were included as a reference group with titanium screws (1.8 mm in diameter) with similar construction. The fixation characteristics (delay, time, and number of screws), distant anatomical results (mandibular ramus height loss, monthly loss rate, and relative loss of reconstructed ramus height), basic functional data (mandibular movements, facial nerve function, and cutaneous perception) and the influence of the effects of the injury (fracture type, fragmentation, occlusion, additional fractures, and associated diseases) on the outcome were evaluated. The long-term results of treatment were evaluated after 18 months. Treatment results similar to those of traditional titanium fixation were found with magnesium screws. Conclusions: Resorbable metal screws can be a favored option for osteosynthesis because surgical reentry can be avoided. These materials provide proper and stable treatment results.

Recent improvements in surgical techniques and materials have enabled stable fixation of zygmomatic fractures. Multiple-point fixation is most commonly used for internal fixation Generally, reduction and fixation are performed through lateral brow, subciliary, temporal, or intraoral incisions (three-point fixation). Our experience indicates that postoperative scarring and sensory disturbances are caused by a subciliary incision with inferior orbital rim fixation. It is thus recommended that inferior orbital rim fixation with mini- or microplates be avoided. In patients in whom the fracture does not involve the orbital floor, reduction of the zygoma and zygomatic arch through a temporal incision is performed at this institution. Fixation of the lateral zygomaticomaxillary buttress and anterior wall of the maxilla with miniplates through an intraoral incision is also performed. If necessary, zygomaticofrontal suture fixation with a miniplate or wire is performed through a lateral brow incision. The status of inferior orbital rim reduction is confirmed by palpitation. Inferior orbital rim fixation with mini- or microplates is recommended for reduction of comminuted fractures and orbital floor fractures with herniation of internal orbit components. Patients who did not undergo inferior orbital rim fixation were free of inferior orbital rim deformity, diplopia, and postreduction rotation.

The technique has its indications and limitations. Most of the typical failure patterns arise from basic technical errors. Types of locking plates, material properties and the general principles of locking plate applications are reviewed together with their misapplication. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Technology has improved the design and material as well as the construct of the fixator. As most patients are converted from external fixation to definite stabilization during later clinical course, prevention of complications such as infection is of high importance. Based on the current literature, principles of temporary external fixation were summarized. We focused on minimizing the risk of infection and introduce a standardized algorithm how to proceed when converting from external to internal fixation, which also was examined for effectiveness.

Failed operative treatment in two cases of pseudarthrosis of the clavicle using internal fixation and bovine cancellous xenograft (Tutobone)	JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC ORTHOPAEDICS-PART B			English	Article						clavicle; congenital; pseudarthrosis; surgery; tutobone; xenograft	CONGENITAL PSEUDOARTHROSIS; ILIAC CREST; BONE-GRAFT; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; PSEUDARTHROSIS; HARVEST; COMPLICATION	The most commonly reported technique of reconstructive surgery for congenital pseudarthrosis of the clavicle involves resection of the pseudarthrosis, insertion of autologous iliac crest bone graft and internal fixation. In an attempt to avoid the potential complications of iliac crest bone graft harvest we used bovine cancellous xenograft (Tutobone). Two cases of pseudarthrosis of the clavicle treated with resection of the pseudarthrosis, Tutobone graft and internal fixation are presented. Both cases resulted in treatment failures, which were associated with significant osteolysis and failure of incorporation of the graft material. This required removal of the loose metalwork and debridement of the failed graft material. We would caution surgeons against the use of Tutobone as a graft material in the surgical management of pseudarthrosis of the clavicle. The level of evidence was level IV case series.

Recent Findings The indications, advantages, and disadvantages of relatively new implants and devices used to treat distal radius fractures are discussed. These include the intramedullary nail, intramedullary cage, radiolucent volar locking plate, distal radius hemiarthroplasty, and bone graft substitutes. The spectrum of distal radius fracture patterns may make it impossible to depend on a single device for fixation, and surgeons managing distal radius fractures should be adept at using various surgical approaches, techniques, and hardware systems. Additional studies demonstrating the cost-effectiveness, biomechanical properties, and clinical outcomes will be useful in determining the utility of the described techniques.

However, postoperative infection associated with internal fixation devices (intramedullary nails, plates, and screws) remains a significant complication, and it is technically difficult to fix multiple fragmented bony fractures using internal fixation devices. In addition, drilling in the bone to install devices can lead to secondary fracture, bone necrosis associated with postoperative infection. In this study, we developed bone clip type internal fixation device using three- dimensional (3D) printing technology. Standard 3D model of the bone clip was generated based on computed tomography (CT) scan of the femur in the rat. Polylacticacid (PLA), hydroxyapatite (HA), and silk were used for bone clip material. The purpose of this study was to characterize 3D printed PLA, PLA/HA, and PLA/HA/Silk composite bone clip and evaluate the feasibility of these bone clips as an internal fixation device. Based on the results, PLA/HA/Silk composite bone clip showed similar mechanical property, and superior biocompatibility compared to other types of the bone clip. PLA/HA/Silk composite bone clip demonstrated excellent alignment of the bony segments across the femur fracture site with well-positioned bone clip in an animal study. Our 3D printed bone clips have several advantages: (1) relatively noninvasive (drilling in the bone is not necessary), (2) patient-specific design (3) mechanically stable device, and (4) it provides high biocompatibility. Therefore, we suggest that our 3D printed PLA/HA/Silk composite bone clip is a possible internal fixation device.

The aim of this study was to describe the osteosynthesis performed in segmental alveolar fractures by internal fixation and evaluate the prognosis of the fractures and teeth involved. Materials and methods Twenty-two patients who were identified as having segmental alveolar fractures treated with osteosynthesis by internal fixation at the authors' department from January 2007 to December 2016 were included with 90 traumatized teeth. The prognosis of the fractures and teeth involved in the fractures was evaluated by the post-operative computed tomography combined with a follow-up study. Results All patients achieved healing and consolidation of the alveolar fractures. Furthermore, the occlusion was restored and the wounds healed. During the surgical procedures, no observed iatrogenic dental damage caused by the interdental drilling was found. Eventually, only 15.6% of the teeth had pulp necrosis, whereas the other healing complications were rare or not observed in the study. Conclusions Osteosynthesis by internal fixation is an effective and safe treatment for some segmental alveolar fractures. The teeth involved in these fractures also have good prognosis.

The absorption intramedullary nail and claw plate indications and efficacy were investigated in the treatment of a life-threatening multiple rib fractures. Methods. A retrospective analysis of 248 surgically treated rib fracture patients was performed who admitted to our hospital from March 2007 to December 2012. Intramedullary nailing was performed in 28 cases, a claw-type bone plate was fixed in 141 cases, and a combination of both was fixed in 79 cases. Results. All internal fixation patients were clinically cured except 1 patient died 14 days after a massive pulmonary embolism. The patients with flail chest and floating chest wall causing respiratory and circulatory disorders were promptly corrected. Routine follow-up was from 1 to 2 years, displaced fractures were in 2 cases, and there were 11 cases of internal fixation and extraction. Conclusion. Internal fixation is a simple and reliable method for the treatment of multiple rib fractures. Both internal fixation materials have their pros and cons but the claw bone plate is more robust. The actual selection of appropriate treatment options helps to improve the treatment efficacy.

Material/Methods: Medical records from 124 patients were collected from February 2010 to April 2015; patients were divided into two groups: group A (mini-open anterior approach focal cleaning combined with posterior internal fixation) and group B (conventional anterior extraperitoneal approach focal cleaning combined with posterior internal fixation in period I). The data on postoperative mechanical ventilation time, preoperative, postoperative, and last follow-up Cobb angle, visual analog scale (VAS), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and Frankel classification were collected and analyzed. Operative complications, internal stability, and bone graft fusion were also observed. Results: All patients were followed-up for 12 to 36 months (average 22.5 months). Seven cases (five in group A and two in group B) had side psoas abscess and were cured after secondary drainage surgery. The rest of the cases were all cured after primary surgery, with no formation of sinus, incisional hernia, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, or recurrence of spinal TB, with no TB symptoms. Bone graft fusion ranged from 3 to 8 months (average 4.7 months). Compared to group B, group A, which had less time on postoperative mechanical ventilation, had a higher VAS score. Both groups had distinct improvements in Cobb angle, ESR, and Frankel classification after surgery. Conclusions: Treating lumbar TB by mini-open anterior approach focal cleaning combined with posterior internal fixation was safe and effective.

Materials and Methods: 58 patients with lower patella fracture were enrolled in this study, including 30 patients treated with modified titanium cable tension band plus patellar tibial tunnel wire "8" tension band internal fixation (modified group), and 28 patients with titanium cable tension band fixation. All patients were followed up for 9 similar to 15 months with an average of 11.6 months. Results: Knee flexion was significantly improved in the modified group than in the titanium cable tension band group (111.33 +/- 13 degrees versus 98.21 +/- 21.70 degrees, P = 0.004). The fracture healing time showed no significant difference. At the end of the follow-up, the improvement excellent rate was 93.33% in the modified group, and 82.14% in the titanium cable tension band group. Titanium cable tension band internal fixation loosening was found in 2 cases, including 1 case of treatment by two surgeries without loose internal fixation. Conclusions: The modified titanium cable tension band with "8" tension band fixation showed better efficacy for lower patella fractures than titanium cable tension band fixation.

The purpose of this study was to compare the biomechanical stability of the anterior process locking plate combined with the percutaneous cannulated screw fixation (screw group) versus the anterior process locking plate fixation alone (plate group) for the treatment of Sanders type II calcaneal fractures using finite element analysis to provide a theoretical basis for clinical work. Material/Methods: We established a 3D model of Sanders type II calcaneal fracture; assigned material properties to the internal fixation systems; applied loads; set up analysis criteria; analyzed the displacement of the fracture, relative displacement, stress state of bone tissue, and internal fixation; and compared mechanical stability. Results: For Sanders type II A, II B, and II C calcaneal fractures, the degree of displacement and relative displacement of the fracture in the screw group was less than that of the plate group. For all subtypes of Sanders type II calcaneal fractures, the screw group had better mechanical stability than the plate group. Conclusions: Both fixation methods (screw and plate group) were within a reasonable range for restoring the levelling effect of the joint surface and maintaining the strength of fixation, and both had good mechanical stability. Finite element analysis is a relatively reliable method, and biomechanics and clinical studies must further verify the experimental results.

Rigid Fixation of the Pediatric Facial Skeleton	ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA			English	Article						Rigid fixation; Internal fixation; Resorbable hardware; Nonresorbable hardware; Craniofacial growth	FRACTURES; TRAUMA; PLATES; PATTERNS	Pediatric facial fractures are uncommon, and the majority is able to be managed with closed reduction or conservative therapy. Operating on the developing facial skeleton carries inherent risks of growth restriction and permanent injury to ossification centers and intrabony anatomy. Both resorbable (PGA/PLA) and nonresorbable (titanium) hardware are safe and appropriate in children. Resorbable implants are thought to reduce long-term complications but nonresorbable implants offer a more robust and rigid fixation. Most surgeons opt to retrieve nonresorbable hard-ware after 2 to 3 months of healing due to migration concerns. Growth restriction from internal fixation has multiple contributions. Properly placed hardware that respects natural suture lines is not thought to significantly inhibit growth. As materials science progresses, manufacturers can hopefully get closer to developing the ideal implant that combines the benefits of both fixation options.

This study evaluated the influence of abutment materials on the stability of the implant:abutment joint in internal conical connection type implant systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Internal conical connection type implants, cement-retained abutments, and tungsten carbide-coated abutment screws were used. The abutments were fabricated with commercially pure grade 3 titanium.(group T3), commercially pure grade 4 titanium (group T4), or Ti-6Al-4V (group TA) (n=5, each). In order to assess the amount of settlement after abutment fixation, a 30-Ncm tightening torque was applied, then the change in length before and after tightening the abutment screw was measured, and the preload exerted was recorded. The compressive bendihg strength was measured under the ISO14801 conditions. In order to determine whether there were significant changes in settlement, preload, and compressive bending strength before and after abutment fixation depending on abutment materials, one-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD post-hoc test was performed. RESULTS. Group TA exhibited the smallest mean change in the combined length of the implant and abutment before and after fixation, and no difference was observed between groups T3 and T4 (P>.05). Group TA exhibited the highest preload and compressive bending strength values, followed by T4, then T3 (P<.001). CONCLUSION. The abutment material can influence the stability of the interface in internal conical connection type implant systems. The strength of the abutment material was inversely correlated with settlement, and positively correlated with compressive bending strength. Preload was inversely proportional to the frictional coefficient of the abutment material.

Today, a multitude of osteosynthesis systems are available on the market. One therapy modality, primarily developed for orthopaedic surgery, is using angular stable osteosynthesis plate systems. The dominating principle of these is the bond between screw and plate following insertion. This principle of an "internal fixateur" results in a more stable fixation of the fragments associated with less compression of the bone surfaces. Material: A new multidirectional osteosynthesis system (TiFix = Smartlock, Hamburg Germany) was modified to fit the maxillofacial region and compared with four other well established osteosynthesis systems developed by Mondial, Medicon, Synthes, Leibinger-Stryker, one of these (Unilock by Synthes) being also angular stable. The resistance to deformation in varying directions was investigated following fixation in four different materials. Results: The TiFix system proved more resistant to deformation even when mounted with fewer screws than the non-angular stable systems. Conclusion: This system results in greater stability even when fewer screws are used. For the clinician this means smaller access incisions, less soft tissue trauma, better aesthetic results, decreased duration of operation and a reduction of costs.

Surgical treatment of comminuted, displaced fractures of the greater tuberosity of the proximal humerus: A new technique of double-row suture-anchor fixation and long-term results	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						greater tuberosity fracture; comminution; double-row fixation; suture-anchor; bicipital impingement	SINGLE-ROW; INTERNAL-FIXATION; REDUCTION	Conventional techniques of internal fixation of displaced fractures of the greater tuberosity may be insufficient in presence of comminution. A new surgical. technique of internal fixation using a double-row of suture-anchors is described. Longterm results of this technique are evaluated in 21 patients with an isolated, displaced and comminuted greater tuberosity fracture at an average of 3.5 years (range 1-5 years) after surgery. The average age of the patients in the study was 51 years (range 17-93 years). Twenty fractures heated without post-operative displacement. The result was rated as excellent in 8, good in 10, satisfactory in 2 and unsatisfactory in 1 patient. Post-operative bicipital impingement in two patients and reaction to fixation material in one patient resulted in persistent, severe pain in the rehabilitation period, necessitating additional surgery.

In this study, a finite element model evaluation was performed of three different methods for osteosynthesis of low subcondylar fractures: (1) two four-hole straight plates, (2) one seven-hole lambda plate, and (3) one four-hole trapezoidal plate. The finite element model evaluation considered a load applied to the first molar on the contralateral side to the fracture. Results showed that, although the three methods are capable of withstanding functional loading, the lambda plate displayed a more homogeneous stress distribution for both osteosynthesis material and bone and may be a better method when single-plate fixation is the option.

However, to complete these conservative therapies, patient cooperation is mandatory. If conservative therapy fails, surgery is required for reduction and prevention of recurrence. It has been considered that surgery for atlantoaxial rotatory fixation necessitates solid bony fusion. However, once bony fusion is achieved, loss of range of motion is problematic. Here, we report a patient with chro-AARF who was successfully treated with temporary internal fixation using a C1 lateral mass screw and C2 pedicle screw (Goel-Harms technique) without any grafting of bone or use of bone substitute materials. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 9-year-old boy with chro-AARF was referred to our institution. He had a history of pervasive developmental disorders. He did not cooperate for the completion of conservative therapy and could not tolerate this therapy. Therefore, the orthopedic staff and his parents considered surgery. Under general anesthesia, reduction was easily performed. The Goel-Harms screw-rod construct was completed as a temporary internal fixator without any grafting of bone or use of bone substitute materials. After 6 months, the screw-rod construct was removed. Removal of the screw-rod construct was performed easily without complication. There was no ankylosis of the C1-2 joint, and cervical range of motion was maintained 2.8 years after removal of the construct. CONCLUSIONS: When conservative therapy cannot be continued, Goel-Harms surgery as a temporary internal fixator without bone grafting might be a suitable alternative for selected patients with chro-AARF.

A multicentric study of 114 cases	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Talus; Internal fixation; Outcomes	NECK FRACTURES; OPEN REDUCTION; TALUS; BODY; CLASSIFICATION	Introduction: Displaced talar neck and body fractures are rare and challenging for the surgeon. Results are often disappointing due to inadequate reduction or internal fixation and high rates of osteoarthritis and osteonecrosis. Very few published series describe the long-term results after internal fixation of talar factures. One of the goals of the 2011 SOO meeting symposium was to specifically evaluate the long-term results after internal fixation of talar fractures. This study included only central fractures. Material and methods: We reviewed the results of 114 central talar fractures that had been treated by internal fixation between 1982 and 2006 in nine hospitals in the Western part of France. The clinical and radiological follow-up was 111 months on average. All the patients with a radiological assessment had at least 5 years of follow-up. Results: Poor reduction was apparent in 33% of cases. The average Kitaoka score was 70/100, which corresponds to an average functional level. At the last follow-up evaluation, 34% of cases had osteonecrosis and 74% had peritalar osteoarthritis. Secondary fusion was required in 25% of cases with an average follow-up of 24 months. Discussion: The complication rate for talar fractures was high, mostly due to osteonecrosis and osteoarthritis; these conditions had an impact on the final outcome. The outcome could be improved by better evaluating these fractures with a CT scan, developing dual surgical approaches to best preserve the bone vascular supply and achieve better reduction, and improving the internal fixation hardware, especially the use of plates for comminuted fractures.

In this study we aimed to evaluate the stability of 2 common internal fixation patterns using 1 or 2 miniplates separately. One novel measuring method based on the angle of miniplates' localization was introduced. Materials and Methods: Twenty-seven patients with 30 sides of extracapsular condylar fracture were enrolled in this retrospective study. All cases were performed open reduction and internal fixation using 1 or 2 titanium plates with both the postoperative immediate CT (T-1) and the over 6 months' follow-up CT (T-2). Mandibles and implants were segmented and reconstructed respectively using SIMPANT 14.04 software. For 1 miniplate group, the sagittal crossing angle (<1) between miniplate (P-1) and posterior border of ipsilateral ramus was measured. For 2 miniplates group, the sagittal crossing angle (<2) between 2 miniplates (P-2a, P-2b) was measured. Both anteroposterior (angle AP) and mediolateral angle change (angle ML) of each miniplate between T1 and T2 was measured. The stability of 2 internal fixation patterns was measured and evaluated based on the angle change of miniplates. And also the stability of each internal fixation pattern could be investigated based on the relationship between the placement patterns of miniplates and the angle change. Results: Fifty-two miniplates were finally segmented and reconstructed successfully, including 8 of 1 miniplate group and 44 of 2 miniplate group. For 1 miniplate group, the average angle AP and angle ML were 6.10 degrees and 8.54 degrees, respectively. For 2 miniplate group, the average angle AP and angle ML of P-2a were 3.02 degrees and 2.56 degrees, respectively, as well as 3.12 degrees and 3.07 degrees of P-2b. Conclusions: The novel measuring method based on the angle of miniplates' localization showed potential for the stability evaluation of internal fixation of condylar fracture. In summary, the internal fixation patterns using 2 miniplates shows better stability than that of 1 miniplate.

The images were divided into training set (1106 images), validation set (272 images), and test set (343 images). The model efficacy is evaluated by using the data on the test set. The overall TOP-1 accuracy, and the precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score of each model are calculated, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are plotted to evaluate the model performance. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) images are used to determine the image features that are most important for DCNN decisions.ResultsA total of 1378 (80%) images were used for model development, and model efficacy was validated on a test set with 343 (20%) images. The overall TOP-1 accuracy was 98.5%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values for each internal fixation model were 1.000, 1.000, 0.980, 1.000, 0.999, and 1.000, respectively. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping showed the unique design of the internal fixation device.ConclusionWe developed a deep convolutional neural network model that can identify the manufacturer and model of hip internal fixation devices from the hip AP radiographs.

The treatment of displaced femoral neck fracture includes internal fixation and arthroplasty. However, which is the best surgical treatment for the elderly patient with displaced femoral neck fractures has been controversial. Our objective was to compare the clinical effects of internal fixation with that of arthroplasty for displaced femoral neck fracture in the elderly (>= 60 y of age). Materials and Methods. We searched for all randomized controlled trials of hip arthroplasty versus internal fixation for displaced femoral neck fractures in the elderly by electronically searching PUBMED (1966 to December, 2008), MEDILINE(1966 to December, 2008) and manually searching grey literatures. The quality of the trials was assessed and meta-analyses were conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration's RevMan 4.2 software. Results. Nineteen published randomized controlled trials involving a total of 3505 patients were suitable for inclusion in the review. The combined results of meta-analyses showed no significant difference in mortality at 1 y postoperatively between the two methods. However, compared with internal fixation, arthroplasty could reduce the rate of reoperations and the major method-related complications. Conclusions. Compared with internal fixation, arthroplasty can not only reduce the surgical revision, but also decrease the incidence of complications, and does not increase mortality. The present meta-analysis shows that there is an evidence base to support arthroplasty as a primary treatment for displaced femoral neck fractures in the elderly. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Plate and screw design in fractures of the hand and wrist	CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH			English	Article							DISTAL RADIUS FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; PHALANGEAL FRACTURES; MINIATURE PLATES; METACARPAL; DORSAL; COMPRESSION; SYSTEMS; COMPLICATIONS; MULTICENTER	As internal fixation of fractures of the hand and wrist has evolved, so too have the implants used for the same purpose. Implants used for the first 1/2 of the 20th century were modeled on implants used to fix long bone fractures. Consequently, they were often bulky. In addition, they often were made of materials which were ill suited to the unique functional and biomechanical requirements of the hand and wrist. As a result, outcomes of internal fixation frequently were suboptimal and complication rates were high. In the past 40 years there has been an evolution in metallurgy, biomechanics, and implant design for fracture fixation in the hand and wrist, quite unlike any other anatomic location in the body. The principal purpose of this review is to highlight these very advances. Implants now are made of highly biocompatible materials, have a low profile, can be contoured to suit individual anatomy, and provide considerably reduced rates of soft tissue irritation. These features afford surgeons the ability to fix complex injuries in a stable manner so as to institute early rehabilitation in an effort to maximize individual outcomes.

This study aimed to report the postoperative outcomes of cementless THA in patients with this condition. Materials and Methods: Between November 2000 and September 2016, 25 consecutive cementless THAs for failed internal fixation after acetabular fractures with a minimum follow-up of 2 years were analyzed. The mean age at the time of surgery was 58 years (36-85 years), and the time elapsed between fracture and THA was 70 months (7-213 months). Clinical and radiologic evaluations were performed on all patients. Results: Clinically, the mean Harris hip score at the last follow-up was 88 points. Walking ability recovered to pre-injury status in 92% patients, and activities of daily living recovered in 96% patients. Radiographically, none of the acetabular cups showed evidence of migration and loosening during the mean follow-up of 50 months. All cases showed stable femoral stem fixation at the last follow-up. Dislocation occurred in three cases (12%). Conclusion: Outcomes of cementless THA after failed internal fixation for acetabular fractures were satisfactory. However, a relatively high incidence of postoperative dislocation is still a concern.

Choosing the proper implant and its material has a great effect on the healing process and failure prevention. The purpose of this analysis was to assess biomechanical behavior of dynamic hip screw with two different materials implanted in the femur during fall and gait. A 3D finite element model of an intact femur and a 3D implant within the same femur were developed. A finite element analysis was carried out to establish the effect of load conditions and implant material properties on biomechanical behavior of the dynamic hip screw after internal fixation. Two load configurations are chosen: one simulating the stance phase of the normal gait cycle, and the other replicating a low-energy fall. The implanted femur was investigated with two different materials for the dynamic hip screw: stainless steel and titanium alloy. During stance, more stress is placed on the implanted femur compared with the intact femur. During a fall, the implanted femur is in a greater state of stress, which mostly occurs inside the dynamic hip screw. Titanium alloy decreases stress levels by an average of 40% compared with stainless steel. However, deformation is slightly reduced with a stainless steel dynamic hip screw during both load cases. After internal fixation, dynamic hip screw generates greater stresses within the implanted femur compared with the intact femur under the same loading conditions. A titanium alloy implant appears to undergo less stress from a low-energy fall compared with stainless steel and can be considered the preferred implant material. The critical parts of the dynamic hip screw are the forth distal screw and the plate.

Materials and Methods: Ten 3-month-old New Zealand white rabbits were included in the study. Surgical fractures were performed in the right mandibular bodies of the 10 rabbits. These fractures were reduced with internal rigid fixation by use of a 1.0-mm titanium system, taking the contralateral left mandibular bodies as the control group. We obtained radiographs preoperatively and at 1, 2, and 3 months postoperatively. Predetermined cephalometric points were used to measure and compare jaw growth. The protocol was approved by the Bioethics Committee of Universidad El Bosque, Bogota, Colombia. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups (P = .95). Mandibular growth in the studied rabbits was not affected by the use of internal rigid fixation. Conclusions: The use of internal rigid fixation for the treatment of induced mandibular fractures in growing rabbits did not alter the normal process of growth and development. The findings of this study should lead to investigations using larger samples and to long-term prospective follow-up studies of children who have undergone open reduction and internal rigid fixation.

When the children are treated and recovered, it needs to be internally fixed and then taken out. With the development of internal fixation materials, the research of surgical methods and the improvement of surgical skills, postoperative removal of orthopedic surgery patients has gradually been included in daytime surgery. While ensuring the safety of children's surgery, it is necessary to shorten the postoperative limb and joint function recovery time, promote the recovery of limb and joint function, the healing of wounds and bones, and reduce the occurrence of these complications. In order to reduce the occurrence of these complications, carry out early rehabilitation education and development early rehabilitation training is very necessary. This paper puts forward the concept of early rehabilitation based on shared decision model, in which doctors, nurses, children and family members participate in the treatment of children before, during and after operation. The effect of early rehabilitation education in the daytime ward after removal of internal fixation was examined. Moreover, through the analysis of the control trial also confirmed that the clinical effect of early rehabilitation in improving and optimizing the rehabilitation of fracture in children is significant.

This article compares biomechanical studies of various fixation methods using a newly developed scoring method. Source of data: The databases PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, Google Scholar and Google were searched for relevant studies. Areas of agreement: Fixation hardware failure remains a problem. Various materials and fixation techniques have been tested to provide an improved fixation of transverse olecranon and patellar fractures. Areas of controversy: The difference in biomechanical testing setup between the studies makes it hard to compare different fixation techniques. Growing points: The newly developed grading method was proved to be unbiased and reliable; however, extra specifications need to be added at some criteria when adopting the scoring method. Areas timely for developing research: Non-metallic constructs may provide an improvement to the currently used metallic tension band wiring technique; however, clinical research is required.

The improved versatility leads to the increased use of these materials in open fractures, with the benefit of early mobilization. The aim of this retrospective study is to discern whether the broadening of the indications for these implants is accompanied by increased complication rates. Methods: Data from 365 patients treated during the last 10 years at our department for metacarpal or phalangeal fractures with stable internal fixation by screw or plate were gathered and analyzed. Results: Uneventful bony consolidation was observed in 91.2% (n = 333). The functional results were excellent to acceptable in 85.2%, whereas in 14.8% ( n = 54), the result was unsatisfactory, the latter group presenting with concominant soft tissue injury. There was no statistically significant difference in infection and nonunion rates when comparing open and closed fractures. Conclusion: These results confirm that most patients with open metacarpal and phalangeal fractures can be treated by stable internal fixation.

This study aims to demonstrate the results of internal fixation of open scapula fractures due to gunshot injuries. Materials and methods Eight patients who had open scapula fractures and were treated by internal fixation through the conventional Judet approach included in this study. Patients were followed up monthly in the first 6 months and every 2 months in the rest of the follow-up. Shoulder range of motion, Constant Shoulder Score, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score were used for functional evaluation. Results The average follow-up period was 34.6 +/- 11.9 months. The average time between injuries and the surgery was 10.5 +/- 5.1 days. The average shoulder abduction of the patients was 135.6 +/- 18.8 degrees, the average forward flexion of the shoulder was 160 +/- 19.2 degrees. The average internal and external rotations of the shoulders were 80 +/- 14.1 degrees and 63.1 +/- 17.3 degrees, respectively. CSS was calculated as 79.8 +/- 14.4, and DASH was calculated as 14.1 +/- 14.9. Conclusions In the treatment of open scapula fractures due to gunshot injuries, an internal fixation is a reliable option and the results were comparable with previous studies.

Outcome of total hip arthroplasty as a salvage procedure for failed infected internal fixation of hip fractures	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Hip fracture; infection; failed internal fixation; antibiotic spacer; total hip arthroplasty	GIRDLESTONE PSEUDOARTHROSIS; RESECTION ARTHROPLASTY; PROXIMAL FEMUR; REPLACEMENT; PROSTHESIS; REVISION; SPACER; JOINT; RECONSTRUCTION; OPERATION	Background: Failed infected internal fixation produces significant pain and functional disability. In infected internal fixation of hip fractures with partial or complete head destruction, total hip arthroplasty (THA) can be technically challenging; however, it restores hip biomechanics. The present study is to evaluate the results and assess the complications of THA following failed infected internal fixation of these fractures. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of prospectively collected data in a tertiary healthcare center was performed of 20 consecutive patients of THA following failed infected internal fixation operated between September 2001 and November 2007. There were 11 dynamic hip screw failures for intertrochanteric fractures, 6 failed osteotomies following transcervical fractures, and 3 failed screw fixations for transcervical fractures. Results: The average age of the patients was 48.5 years (range 28-70 years) and the average followup period was 6.5 years (range 3.5-10.5 years). An indigenously designed cement spacer was used in a majority of patients ( n = 15). The custom-made antibiotic impregnated cement spacer was prepared on-table, with the help of a K-nail bent at 130 degrees, long stem Austin Moores prosthesis (n=1), Charnleys prosthesis (n=1), or bent Rush nail (n=1). The antibiotic mixed cement was coated over the hardware in its doughy phase and appropriately shaped using an asepto syringe or an indigenously prepared spacer template. Nineteen of the 20 patients underwent two-stage revision surgeries. The average Harris hip score improved from 35.3 preoperatively to 82.85 postoperatively at the last followup. A significant difference was found ( P < 0.0001). None of the patients had recurrence of infection. Conclusions: The results were comparable to primary arthroplasty in femoral neck fractures. Thus, THA is a useful salvage procedure for failed infected internal fixation of hip fractures.

However, whether intramedullary or extramedullary fixation is the primary treatment for subtrochanteric femur fractures in adults remains debatable. Materials and methods: The Cochrane library, Embase, Google Scholar, and PubMed databases were searched separately for all relevant studies published before January 1, 2015. No language restriction was applied. Prospective randomized controlled trials that compared intramedullary or extramedullary internal fixation to repair subtrochanteric femur fractures in adults were included. We determined intraoperative data, postoperative complications, fracture fixation complications, wound infection, hospital stay days, and final outcome measures to assess the relative effects of different internal fixation methods for the treatment of subtrochanteric femur fractures in adults. Results: Six studies were included in our meta-analysis. The relative risks (RRs) of revision rate was 83% lower (RR, 0.17, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05 to 0.60; P=0.006), fixation failure rate was 64% lower (RR, 0.36, 95% CI, 0.12 to 1.08; P=0.07), non-union rate was 77% lower (RR, 0.23, 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.81; P=0.02) in the intramedullary group compared with the extramedullary group. No significant differences were found between the intramedullary group and extramedullary group for intraoperative data, postoperative complications, wound infection, hospital stay days or final outcome measures. Conclusion: In conclusion, our meta-analysis suggests that there was no significant difference in intraoperative data, postoperative complications, wound infection, hospital stay days or final outcome measures between intramedullary and extramedullary internal fixation. However, a significant decrease occurred in the rate of fracture fixation complications for patients treated with intramedullary internal fixation, especially in elderly patients. Some differences were not significant, but the treatment of elderly subtrochanteric femur fractures using intramedullary internal fixation is recommended.

J	Wang, ZK; Hu, QL; Wang, YX				Wang ZhengKe; Hu QiaoLing; Wang YouXiang			Preparation of chitosan rods with excellent mechanical properties: One candidate for bone fracture internal fixation	SCIENCE CHINA-CHEMISTRY			English	Article						chitosan; glutaraldehyde; layer-by-layer structure; reinforcement; biomedical material	CONTROLLED-RELEASE; CROSS-LINKING; MICROSPHERES; MEMBRANE	Chitosan (CS) is one promising material as a temporary mechanical supporter for bone fracture internal fixation. In our previous work, we successfully fabricated CS rods through one in situ precipitation route. But bending strength and bending modulus of CS rods need to be improved to match the commercially available devices used for bone fracture internal fixation. In this research, CS rods were reinforced effectively through cross-linking reaction by using glutaraldehyde as the coupling reagent. Schiff's base was detected by FTIR due to the chemical reaction between amino groups and aldehyde groups. Crystal plane space of CS rods became small during the formation of network structure. Microstructure was observed by SEM, indicating that layer-by-layer structure became much tighter after cross-linking reaction, and cracks in one layer turned around when they reached another layer to absorb energy. Bending strength and bending modulus of cross-linked CS rods could reach 186.3 MPa and 5.17 GPa, respectively. Compared with uncross-linked CS rods, they are increased by 101.6% and 26.1%, respectively. As a result, mechanical properties of CS rods are equivalent to the commercially available biodegradable devices. CS rods with excellent mechanical properties are a good candidate for bone fracture internal fixation.

The role of brachioradialis release during AO type C distal radius fracture fixation	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Distal radius fracture; Brachioradialis release; Column plate; Open reduction and internal fixation	INTERNAL-FIXATION; INTRAARTICULAR FRACTURES; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; LOCKING PLATES; WRIST; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM	Introduction: Open reduction and internal fixation of distal radius fractures often necessitates release of the brachioradialis from the radial styloid. However, whether this common procedure makes the reduction and fixation easier and affects the elbow function has not been fully understood. Hypothesis: Brachioradialis (BR) release during volar plate fixation for type C distal radius fractures makes internal reduction and fixation easier, and it does not adversely affect wrist or elbow function. Material and methods: A total of 74 patients treated with 2.4mm volar locking compression column plate (VCP) were analyzed for type C distal radius fractures prospectively. The patients were divided into two groups, group A with BR release and group B without BR release. The two groups were compared in terms of "internal reduction and fixation time" during the operation, wrist and elbow function including the scores of Gartland and Werley (G-W), Patient-related wrist evaluation score (PRWE), Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS), the Disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) and a Visual analog scale (VAS) for pain at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. The radial inclination angle, palmar tilt angle and ulnar variance were also measured from the radiographs. Results: According to the follow-up of the 74 patients, no significant differences were observed between the two groups on MEPS, DASH, G-W, PRWE, VAS and radiological outcomes at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Mean time of reduction and internal fixation was significantly shorter in group A than that in group B. Conclusion: Release of the BR for type C distal radius fractures facilitated the surgical procedure and did not adversely affect elbow and wrist function. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Methods: Six formalin-preserved cadaveric pelvis were used for this investigation. Pressure-sensitive film was used to measure contact area and pressure within the anterior, superior, and posterior regions of the acetabulum. The pelvis were loaded under the following four conditions: (1) intact; (2) following a creation posterior wall fracture defect; (3) following reduction and standard internal fixation with reconstruction plate: (4) following reduction and internal fixation with a new shape memory alloy device named ATMFS. A posterior wall fracture was created along an arc of 40-90 degrees about the acetabular rim. Findings: Creation of a posterior wall defect resulted in increased load in the superior acetabulum (1422 N) as compared to the intact condition (762 N,P = 0.007). Following reduction and internal fixation, the load distributed to the superior acetabulum (1486 N) was not statistically different from the defect condition. Following the fixation with ATMFS, the load seen at the superior region of the actabulum (936 N) was less than fixation with reconstruction plate and was not different from intact state (P = 0.4). Interpretation: These data indicate that the use of ATMFS as a fracture internal fixation device resulted a partial restoration of joint loading parameters toward the intact state. ATMFS fixation may result in a clinical benefit. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, they may not be suitable for repairing proximal olecranon avulsion fractures. In this study, we present a novel fixation technique for the treatment of proximal avulsion fractures, which is a T-shaped plate combined with a wire. Materials and methodsBetween March 2016 and May 2020, surgery was performed on 16 patients with proximal olecranon avulsion fractures by using a T-shaped plate combined with a wire fixation at our hospital. The parameters followed were fracture healing time, elbow range of motion (ROM), related functional scores (the Mayo score and the DASH score), and complications related to internal fixation. ResultsThe average follow-up period was 17 (14-21) months and fractures had healed in all patients included in the study, with an average fracture union of 9.25 (8-12) weeks. No patient reported fixation failure, serious infection, or revision surgery. The average ROM of the elbow joint was 123 degrees (120-135 degrees). The Mayo score was excellent in 11 patients and good in 5. The average DASH score was 17.75 (12-24). ConclusionOlecranon avulsion fractures were fixed with a T-shaped steel plate combined with a steel wire, which can be used for early functional exercise and for achieving good final functional results. This method can provide stable fixation, especially in elderly patients with osteoporosis.

Thus, we propose use of anterior ring internal fixation combined with sacroiliac screw fixation for Tile C3 pelvic fractures. Material/Methods: A normal pelvic finite element model (model 1) was established. Two-screw, three-screw, and four-screw anterior ring internal fixators and plate combined with sacroiliac screw Tile C3 pelvic fracture models (models 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively) were also established. A vertical load of 600 N was applied on S1. The distribution of displacement and stress in the standing and sitting positions was compared. Results: Models 2, 3, 4, and 5 can provide effective fixation. Compared with model 1, in the erect position, the maximum displacement of models 2, 3, 4, and 5 increased by 66.51%, 65.36%, 35.16%, and 35.47% and the maximum stress increased by 201.78%, 130.65%, 100.82%, and 99.03%, respectively. Compared with model 1, in sitting position, the maximum displacement of models 2, 3, 4, and 5 increased by 9.1%, 11.04%, 5.57%, and 8.59% and the maximum stress increased by 157.73%, 118.02%, 98.32%, and 93.16%, respectively. Conclusions: Anterior ring internal fixators combined with sacroiliac screws can effectively fix Tile C3 pelvic fractures.

This report presents a case series of mandibular subcondylar fractures performed with combined endoscopic transoral and transbuccal approaches and the results. Materials and Methods: Sixteen patients with mandibular condylar fractures were preoperatively assessed for risk and underwent open reduction and internal fixation with the endoscope-assisted transoral approach. Duration of hospital stay was recorded and patients were followed for an average of 17 months for possible complications. Results: No major complications were encountered in any patient. Minimal angulation was observed in 3 patients. One patient had late complaints of temporomandibular joint pain. Conclusion: Endoscopic-assisted mandibular condylar fracture repair includes special surgical equipment and manipulation not used in classic methods. With this approach, subcondylar fractures can be more readily manipulated through a transbuccal puncture with appropriate fixation achieved.

Osteoporotic fractures and deboning are common injuries in orthopaedic surgery, often due to abnormal disorders following an ankle fracture. Various fractures can occur depending on the shape, size, and position of the foot at the time of the injury. With the continuous development of science and the continuous improvement of modern sports level, scientists and sports workers worldwide recognize the importance of applying new materials in sports equipment. Composite material is a combination of multiphase combination material. In short, two or more components with different properties and different forms are used in a multimaterial combination of composite means. The organic combination of related scientific equipment and composite materials promotes the development of sports equipment and the probability of reducing sports injury. The function of the existing graphene composite is analyzed and applied, and the combination of graphene composite and sports is realized theoretically. The clinical application of graphene composite in sports is studied to promote sports development. This article mainly studies the clinical application of graphene composite in ankle fracture internal fixation in sports. It is found that with the increasingly mature application of graphene rubber composite, graphene fiber composite, and other graphene composite materials, it can be widely used in all aspects of sports equipment. Graphene composite materials can be used more easily in sports equipment. In this article, the thermal material conversion algorithm, Schrodinger equation in quantum mechanics, and the use method of graphene composite materials are used to study the clinical application of graphene composite in the internal fixation of ankle joint fracture in sports. The frequent injury and instability of ankle and knee joints are signs of ankle and knee joint injury. The main factors that affect the instability of ankle and knee function are the comprehensive effects of motion range, muscle force valgus, and body feeling, and graphene composite materials are widely used in the internal fixation of ankle joint fracture in sports. The results show that graphene composite can be used in sports equipment and has a great space and high feasibility through the analysis of four groups of sports equipment. It shows that advanced materials play a very important role in the research of sports equipment.

Some authors have developed minimally invasive procedures. The aim of the present study was to compare two minimally invasive internal fixation techniques for unstable extra-articular distal radius fracture in women over 50 years of age: volar plate (minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis: MIPO), and intramedullary nail. Hypotheses: The main study hypothesis was that the incision scar left by minimally invasive internal fixation is smaller using MIPO than an intramedullary nail. The secondary hypotheses were that the two techniques do not differ in terms of pain, functional score, strength, range of motion and radiologic indices. Material and method: The series comprised nineteen A2.2 and one A2.1 fractures in 20 female patients with a mean age of 72 years. The first 10 (group 1) received minimally invasive internal fixation of the distal radius by MIPO, and the other 10 (group 2) by intramedullary nail locked onto the distal radius epiphysis and diaphysis. Results: The main study hypothesis was confirmed: the incision scar left by minimally invasive internal fixation was smaller using MIPO than an intramedullary nail (mean, 14.3 mm vs. 32.8 mm). Some of the secondary hypotheses were also confirmed: there were no differences between the two techniques in terms of pain at 6 months, QuickDASH, PRWE (Patient-Reported Wrist Evaluation), range of motion or ulnar variance; two were not confirmed: pain at 6 weeks was less with intramedullary nails, and palmar slope was better with MIPO. Discussion and conclusion: The main study hypothesis was confirmed: the incision scar left by minimally invasive internal fixation was smaller using MIPO than an intramedullary nail. In conclusion, the present findings showed that internal fixation of unstable extra-articular fracture in over 50-year-olds gave better clinical results at 6 weeks using an intramedullary nail, while MIPO required smaller incision.

Materials and method: A total of 119 patients with Schatzker types I similar to III lateral tibial plateau fracture admitted to our hospital from January 2017 to January 2021 were included retrospectively. According to different surgical procedures selected by doctors, the patients were divided into the arthroscopy group (64 cases), who were treated with arthroscopy-assisted reduction and internal fixation and open group (55 cases), who were treated with open reduction and internal fixation. The general data, surgery time, incision length, intraoperative blood loss, hospital stay, soft tissue injury and excellent and good rates of the U. S. Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score 12 months after surgery of two groups were compared. Results: There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of general data (P>0.05). The surgery time in the arthroscopy group was significantly longer than that in the open group (P<0.05). The incision length and intraoperative blood loss in the arthroscopy group were significantly less than those in the open group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference between two groups in hospital stay (P>0.05). The incidence of soft tissue injury in the arthroscopy group was significantly higher than that in the open group (P<0.05). The excellent and good rates of HSS score 12 months after surgery in the arthroscopy group were significantly higher than those in the open group (P<0.05). Conclusion: Compared with open reduction and internal fixation, arthroscopy-assisted reduction and internal fixation can effectively lower the degree of iatrogenic trauma and facilitate functional recovery in the treatment of Schatzker types I similar to III lateral tibial plateau fracture, but may increase surgery time.

Percutaneous screw configuration versus perimeter plating of calcaneus fractures: A cadaver study	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						calcaneus fracture; percutaneous fixation; perimeter plate; cadaver study	DISPLACED INTRAARTICULAR FRACTURES; FIXATION	Percutaneous screw configuration has been used clinically to reduce the high rate of wound complications associated with the extensile approach of standard open reduction and internal plate fixation. The aim of this cadaveric biomechanical study was to compare the strength of the standard perimeter plating with that of the percutancous screw configuration for a Sanders type-2B calcaneus fracture. Materials and Methods: Ten pairs of fresh-frozen cadaveric lower limbs were prepared and osteotomized to create a Sanders type-2B fracture. Of each pair, one specimen underwent open reduction and internal fixation with standard perimeter plating; the other was stabilized with the percutaneous screw configuration. Each foot was compressed axially via the talar dome (1 mm/sec) until failure occurred. Differences in treatment groups were analyzed for significance (p < 0.05) using paired t-tests. Results: Construct stiffness was 158 +/- 85 and 113 +/- 60 N/mm for the plate and percutaneous fixation, respectively (p = 0.18). Failure occurred at an average of 1156 +/- 513 and 1064 +/- 540 N for the plate and percutaneous construct, respectively (p = 0.65). Conclusion: The results suggest that open reduction and internal fixation with percutaneous screw configuration for Sanders type-2B calcaneus fractures provides a strength similar to that of perimeter plating. Clinical Relevance: Percutaneous screw fixation of calcaneus fractures may provide fracture reduction similar to plate fixation.

Computational investigations of mechanical failures of internal elate fixation	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART H-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE			English	Article						bone fracture; plate fixation; stress concentration; fatigue failure; finite element analysis	TISSUE DIFFERENTIATION; ORTHOPEDIC IMPLANT; FATIGUE FAILURE; PLATE FIXATION; FRACTURE; STRENGTH	This paper investigated the biomechanics of two clinical cases of bone fracture treatments. Both fractures were treated with the same locking compression plate but with different numbers of screws as well as different plate materials. The fracture treated with 12 screws (rigid fixation) failed at 7 weeks with the plate breaking; the fracture with six screws (flexible fixation) endured the entire healing process. It was hypothesized that the plate failure in the unsuccessful case was due to the material fatigue induced by stress concentration in the plate. As the two clinical cases had different fracture locations and different plate materials, finite element simulations were undertaken for each fractured bone fixed by both a rigid and a flexible method. This enabled comparisons to be made between the rigid and flexible fixation methods. The fatigue life was assessed for each fixation method. The results showed that the stress in the rigid fixation methods could be significantly higher than that in flexible fixation methods. The fatigue analyses showed that, with the stress level in flexible fixation (i.e. with fewer screws), the plate was able to endure 2000 days, and that the plate in rigid fixation could fail by fatigue fracture in 20 days. The paper concludes that the rigid fixation method resulted in serious stress concentrations in the plate, which induced fatigue failure. The flexible fixation gave sufficient stability and was better for fracture healing.	[Chen, G.; Schmutz, B.; Wullschleger, M.; Pearcy, M. J.; Schuetz, M.

Conversion of external fixation to open reduction and internal fixation for complex distal radius fractures	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Distal radius fracture; Infection; External fixation; Open reduction internal fixation	INFECTION; CLASSIFICATION; METAANALYSIS; MANAGEMENT	Introduction: Distal radius fractures are common injuries treated in a multitude of ways. One treatment paradigm not extensively studied is initial treatment by external fixation (EF) followed by conversion to open reduction internal fixation (ORIF). Such a paradigm may be beneficial in damage control situations, when there is extensive soft tissue injury, or when appropriate personnel/hospital resources are not available for immediate internal fixation. Hypothesis: There is no increased risk of infection when converting EF to ORIF in the treatment of complex distal radius fractures when conversion occurs early or if EF pin sites are overlapped by the definitive fixation. Materials and methods: Using an IRB approved protocol, medical records over nine years were queried to identify patients with distal radius fractures that had undergone initial EF and were later converted to ORIF. Charts were reviewed for demographic data, injury characteristics, operative details, time to conversion from EF to ORIF, assessment of whether the EF pin sites overlapped the definitive fixation, presence of infection after ORIF, complications, and occupational therapy measurements of range of motion and strength. Results: In total, 16 patients were identified, only one of which developed an infection following conversion to ORIF. Fisher's exact testing showed that infection did not depend on open fracture, time to conversion of one week or less, presence of EF pin sites overlapping definitive fixation, fracture classification, high energy mechanism of injury, or concomitant injury to the DRUJ. Discussion: Planned staged conversion from EF to ORIF for complex distal radius fractures does not appear to result in an increased rate of infection if conversion occurs early or if the EF pin sites are overlapped by definitive fixation. This treatment paradigm may be reasonable for treating complex distal radius fractures in damage control situations, when there is extensive soft tissue injury, or when appropriate personnel/hospital resources are not available for immediate internal fixation.

Hardware removal rates after surgical treatment of proximal femur fractures Nationwide trends in Finland in 1997-2016	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Fixation; Material; Removal; Secondary; Endoprosthesis	AGE-ADJUSTED INCIDENCE; HIP-FRACTURE; FEMORAL-NECK; INTERTROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; INTRAMEDULLARY NAIL; UNITED-STATES; SCREW; ARTHROPLASTY; METAANALYSIS	Background Various internal fixation methods have been used to treat proximal femur fractures and occasionally the fixation material is removed. However, nationwide trends of hardware removals are not known. Thus, this study investigated the hardware removal rates after proximal femur fractures in Finland during 1997-2016. Materials and methods Finnish adults aged 18 years or older in 1997-2016 formed the basic study population. From the National Hospital Discharge Register patients with trochanteric femur fracture treated with an intramedullary nail (IMN) or dynamic hip screw (DHS), and patients with femoral neck fracture treated with screw fixation, were included. Hardware removal and secondary prosthesis rates were assessed. Results Altogether 41,253 patients underwent proximal femoral fracture fixation surgery in Finland in 1997-2016. Of these, 16,152 were DHS surgery and 15,724 IMN surgery and 8491 underwent screw operation of femoral neck fracture. The total removal rates of DHS and IMN were 5.5% and 5.4%. The total removal rate of screw fixations of the femoral neck was higher, 18.5%. The total removal rates during the first 3 years after the IMN more than halved in 1997-2013, from 7.6% to 3.7%, whereas the removal rate of the DHS or screw fixation of femoral neck fractures did not show consistent trend. The rate of secondary prosthesis operations following DHS and IMN was low (1.8% for both). This was in clear contrast to the prosthesis rate following screw fixations of the femoral neck (7.2%). Conclusions IMN operations largely replaced DHS operations in trochanteric fractures of the proximal femur in Finland in 1997-2016. The removal and secondary prosthesis rates of the DHS and IMN were clearly lower than the corresponding rates after screw fixations of the femoral neck fracture.

SoFCOT	Distal humerus fractures in patients over 65: Complications	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Distal fracture of the Humerus; Internal fixation; Plate; Locking plate	TOTAL ELBOW ARTHROPLASTY; REDUCTION-INTERNAL-FIXATION; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; COMPLEX FRACTURES; REPLACEMENT; PLATE; HEMIARTHROPLASTY	Introduction: Fractures of the distal humerus in patients over the age of 65 remain a therapeutic challenge. Treatment options include conservative treatment, internal fixation or total elbow arthroplasty. The complications of these different treatment options were evaluated in a multicentre study. Materials and methods: Four hundred and ninety-seven medical records were evaluated. A retrospective study was performed in 410 cases: 34 received conservative treatment, 289 internal fixation and 87 underwent total elbow arthroplasty. A prospective study was performed in 87 cases: 22 received conservative treatment, 53 internal fixation, and 12 underwent total elbow arthroplasty. Patients were evaluated after at least 6 months follow-up. Results: The rate of complications was 30% in the retrospective study and 29% in the prospective study. The rate of complications in the conservative treatment group was 60%, and the main complication was essentially malunion. The rate of complications was 44% in the internal fixation group and included neuropathies, mechanical failure or wound dehiscence. Although complications only developed in 23% of total elbow arthroplasties, they were often more severe than those following other treatments. Discussion: Complications develop in one out of three patients over 65 with distal humerus fractures. Three main types of complications were identified. Neuropathies especially of the ulnar nerve, especially during arthroplasty, must always be identified, the nerve requiring isolation and transposition. Bone complications, due principally to mechanical failure, were found following internal fixation. Despite technical progress, care must be taken not to favor excessive utilization of this treatment option in complex fractures on fragile bone. Although there were relatively fewer complications with total elbow arthroplasty they were more difficult to treat. Ossifications were frequent whatever the surgical option and can jeopardize the functional outcome. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

In this retrospective study, the primary objective was to compare clinical and radiologic outcomes of lateral closing-wedge osteotomy with either internal fixation or external fixation in pediatric patients with cubitus varus deformities. Materials and methods: From 2010 to 2017, 35 consecutive patients with cubitus varus deformities secondary to supracondylar fractures were included in this study. After corrective osteotomy was performed via a limited lateral approach, the method of definitive fixation was chosen between internal and external. Retrospectively, patients who underwent external fixation on the lateral aspect of the elbow were defined as group I (n = 16) whereas patients with unilateral single-plate fixation were defined as group II (n =19). The functional outcome was evaluated using the Mayo Elbow Performance Score and Flynn criteria. Results: No significant difference in age was found between the 2 groups (P = .15). Significantly lower costs, a shorter operation duration, smaller scars, and a shorter time for plaster cast use postoperatively were found in group I (P < .001). No nonunion or failure of fixation was found. No significant difference was noted in postoperative elbow range of motion or Mayo Elbow Performance Score (P = .64). Both groups achieved satisfactory functional and cosmetic results. Conclusions: In pediatric patients with cubitus varus, both methods of fixation after lateral closing-wedge corrective osteotomy are reliable, with a low rate of complications and satisfactory functional results. External fixation is more advantageous in terms of easier preoperative planning, shorter operative times, lower costs, and easier postoperative fixation removal.

One of these techniques is the internal fixation, which has an important place in practice. OBJECTIVE: In this study, fractured tibia bone has been treated with implants as numerically to investigate the stress behavior and the effect of plate material, shape and dimensions under pressure load. METHODS: The outer part of the bone is chosen as orthotropic and the inner part is chosen as isotropic material. The plate has been modeled to take the form of the bone surface and the finite element method has been used for numerical analysis. The effect of stress on bones and implants has been examined for 1% healing by changing the plate length, plate width and plate material. RESULTS: It has been observed that the increase in plate length decreases cortical bone stress until a specific length. On the other hand, the increase in plate width has increased the stress on the bone. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to form the appropriate plate surface to the bone surface in terms of compliance with the bones.

Several clinical and biomechanical studies exist in the literature which, comparing the stability of different osteosynthesis materials and techniques, were performed using two or three-point biomechanical test models. The aim of this study was to compare the stability of biodegradable and titanium materials for SSRO on one-piece polyurethane mandible samples which were fixed in a novel designed 6-point testing unit. Materials and methods: 16 polyurethane one piece replicas of human mandibles were used and bilateral SSRO were performed by the manufacturer according to Dal Pont modification. Mandibles were fixed with titanium and PLLA/PGA fixation materials. Displacement amounts were measured under loading forces using a non-contact extensometer, and strain values at the screws were recorded by strain gauges. Results: Bicortical titanium screws (Group 2) showed significantly lower displacement values, while bicortical PLLA/PGA screws (group 4) showed significantly higher displacement values at 40-360 N forces. (p < 0.05). The highest strain value was measured on screws that were inserted upright in a proximal segment near the osteotomy line. Conclusion: To achieve more realistic results in biomechanical studies, test models should imitate jaw movements and test environments should be as similar as possible to physiological conditions. Newly designed six-point testing units will contribute to future biomechanical studies. (c) 2017 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to perform a prospective randomized study to compare bone union, complications and functional results of two types of internal fixation of the fibula (plating and the Epifisa (R) FH intramedullary nail). Materials and methods: Inclusion criteria were: closed fractures, isolated displaced fractures of the lateral malleolus, inter- and supra-tubercular bimalleolar fractures, and trimalleolar fractures. This study included 71 patients (mean age 53 +/- 19): plate fixation group (n = 35) and intramedullary nail fixation group (n = 36). In seven cases, intramedullary nailing was technically impossible and was converted to plate fixation (the analysis of this sub-group was performed independently). Two patients died and two patients were lost to follow-up. The final comparative series included 32 cases of plate fixation and 28 cases of intramedullary nail fixation. Union, postoperative complications and Kitaoka and Olerud-Molander functional scores were analyzed after one year of follow-up. Results: There was no significant difference in the rate of union (P = 0.5605) between the two types of fixation. There were significantly fewer complications (7% versus 56%) and better functional scores (96 versus 82 for the Kitaoka score; 97 versus 83 for the Olerud-Molander score) with intramedullary nailing than with plate fixation. Conclusion: Intramedullary nailing of the lateral malleolus in non-comminuted ankle fractures with-out syndesmotic injury is a reproducible technique with very few complications that provides better functional results than plate fixation.

Although injectable brushite cements may help to refill bone defects stabilized with internal fixation, human data remains unavailable. The main goal of this prospective multicenter study was to observe the performance of this material in a clinical setting. Patients and Methods: The study conducted in seven trauma units included closed metaphyseal distal radius and proximal tibia fractures with bone defects, stabilized with internal fixation and subsequent filling with brushite cement. At 6- and 12-month follow-ups, patient satisfaction (visual analog scale [VAS]) was recorded, as well as complications. Results: Thirty-eight proximal tibia fractures and 37 patients with distal radius fractures were included. Overall patient satisfaction with the treatment was high (mean VAS = 92 and 91 for proximal tibia and distal radius, respectively), despite the loss of reduction being described in 11% of proximal tibia and 24% of distal radius fractures; the majority of them included severe fracture types. Radiological evaluation showed postoperative cement leakage in 20 cases, where the majority occurred at the distal radius (n = 15). In 13 distal radius fractures, the leakage was resorbed by the final examination. Conclusion: The tested material showed good outcome in the majority of patients and adequate resorption characteristics, even in the case of extravasation. Stable internal fixation, sufficient bone quality, and no contact between the cement and joint are essential requirements for chronOS Inject, which can be considered as an alternative to existing augmentation materials.

SOFCOT	Blade-plate fixation for distal femoral fractures: A case-control study	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Distal femoral fractures; Internal fixation; Blade-plate	INVASIVE STABILIZATION SYSTEM; INTERNAL-FIXATION; CONDYLAR PLATE; FEMUR; FAILURE; SCREW	Background: The blade-plate is the earliest of the contemporary internal fixation devices introduced for distal femoral fractures. The recent development of dedicated, fixation devices has considerably limited its use. The objective of this study was to evaluate outcomes after blade-plate fixation and after fixation using other devices. Hypothesis: Outcomes after blade-plate fixation are similar to those after condylar screw-plate, distal femoral nail, or locking condylar plate fixation. Material and methods: We reviewed outcomes after 62 patients managed with blade-plate fixation and included in a multicentre retrospective study (n = 57) or a multicentre prospective study (n = 5) and we compared them to outcomes after fixation using condylar screw-plates (n = 82), distal femoral nail (n = 219), or locking condylar plates (n = 301). The four groups were comparable for age, gender distribution, occupational status, prevalence of skin wounds, patient-related factors, type of accident, and type of fracture. The evaluation relied on the clinical International Knee Society (IKS) score and on radiographs. Results: No significant differences existed across the four groups for operative time, blood transfusion use, complications, need for bone grafting, non-union rate, or IKS score values. The early surgical revision rate for removal of the fixation material was 4% with the blade-plate and 16% with the other three fixation devices (P = 0.02). Post-operative fracture deformity was similar in the four groups with, however, a higher proportion of residual malalignment in the screw-fixation group. The final anatomic axis was 3.3 +/- 1.4 degrees with the blade-plate versus 2.3 +/- 3.7 degrees with the other three fixation devices. The blade-plate group had few patients with axial malalignment, and the degree of malalignment was limited to 3 degrees of varus and 10 degrees of valgus at the most, compared to 10 degrees and 18 degrees respectively, with the other three fixation devices. Conclusion: Despite the now extremely limited use and teaching of blade-plate fixation, as well as the undeniable technical challenges raised by the implantation of this device, the blade-plate is a simple, strong, and inexpensive fixation method. It remains reliable for the fixation of distal femoral fractures. The disfavour into which the blade-plate is currently falling is not warranted. Level of evidence: III, case-control study.

In our institution, multifragmentary fractures of the distal pole are treated with the basket plate, which is shaped to fit the geometry of the patellar apex. This implant has been used in our institution for over 25 years. The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term results of internal fixation of comminuted fractures of the patellar apex with the basket plate. Materials and methods: A total of 142 patients with fracture of the distal pole of the patella were treated with the basket plate between 1988 and 2013. Functional evaluation was conducted using the modified Cincinnati knee rating system. A total of 98 patients were available for late functional evaluation. Results: There were no infections or implant-related problems during the follow-up period. All fractures healed within 8 to 10 weeks. There were three cases of early revision because of improper use of the implant and incorrect indication. Functional outcome following internal fixation with the basket plate was excellent in 80 patients and good in 18; there were no poor results. Conclusion: Internal fixation with the basket plate is recommended for management of multifragmentary fractures of the patellar apex because this method enables early, unrestricted knee motion, and provides reliable healing and good functional outcome. This method is an alternative to partial patellectomy and is considered a patella-saving procedure; therefore, the use of the basket plate is strongly recommended for the treatment of distal pole fractures.

J	Lee, J; Kim, JJ; Kim, W				Lee, Jongseok; Kim, Jung-Jae; Kim, Wanlim			Pathological fractures of the femur after radiation therapy for soft tissue tumor: a case series of seven patients treated with repeated internal fixation	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Pathological fracture; Radiation therapy; Internal fixation; Soft tissue tumor	FEMORAL-SHAFT FRACTURES; LOWER-EXTREMITY; SARCOMA; MANAGEMENT; RISK	Introduction Pathological femoral fracture (PFF) after radiation therapy (RT) for soft tissue tumor is a debilitating complication with a high rate of nonunion that requires multiple subsequent procedures and hindrance of functional activity. We aimed to evaluate healing rate after repeated internal fixation in a case series of PFF after RT. Materials and methods We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who had PFF after RT and were treated at our center between 2007 and 2018. We analyzed our surgical protocols and fracture healing rate. Interpretation We identified and analyzed a total of seven patients (six females and one male) whose mean age at fracture was 58 years. Primary tumors consisted of soft tissue sarcoma (n = 5), melanoma (n = 1), and desmoid tumor (n = 1). All primary tumors were treated with surgical excision and adjuvant RT. The mean follow-up duration after fracture was 33 months (range, 16-58). At the last follow-up, five out of seven fractures had completely healed, and two lesions showed delayed union at 15 and 16 months, respectively. Among the five complete unions, one fracture was healed after the first fixation. The remaining four lesions were treated with second internal fixation due to nonunion/metal failure or delayed union. The mean time to radiologic healing after the last fixation was 6.8 months (range, 5-8). Conclusions Our results suggest that bones within the RT field retain healing capacities, and that repeated internal fixation may be a viable option for the treatment of PFF after RT.

However, internal fixation has been followed by high rates of revision for mechanical complications and of femoral neck impaction within the first postoperative year. The objective of this study was to determine whether femoral neck impaction was associated with avascular necrosis (AVN). Hypothesis: Fracture healing with femoral neck shortening by impaction after internal fixation of a femoral neck fracture is associated with AVN. Material and methods: A single-centre retrospective study in patients with Garden I fractures managed by screw fixation was performed to compare outcomes in the groups with and without femoral neck impaction. Follow-up radiographs were assessed for evidence of the femoral neck impaction during fracture healing. The occurrence of AVN was the primary evaluation criterion. The secondary evaluation criteria were risk factors for impaction and complications. Results: Of the 75 included patients, 9 (12%) experienced AVN. Impaction was significantly associated with AVN (p = 0.02; relative risk, 4.38). Significant risk factors for impaction were a higher body mass index (p =0.0003) and valgus-impacted fracture reduction between the radiographs at baseline and immediately after surgery (p = 0.0001). Discussion: Femoral neck impaction was a significant risk factor for AVN after screw fixation of Garden I fractures. Valgus-impacted fracture reduction must receive careful attention during fixation. We suggest static internal fixation if the impaction is reduced on a traction table and advise caution when using parallel screws. The diagnostic and therapeutic strategy proposed here deserves to be evaluated in a prospective study. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

New implant systems are finding to fixation of bone multifractures. One of such stabilization system is analyzed in this article. This article is focused on the material research of the elements of the innovative system designed to fixation of multisite bone fractures. The components are manufactured by means of the selective laser melting (SLM) 3D printing technology (3DPT). Their chemical composition, as well as the surface and internal structure of small-sized elements, is tested. The influence of heat treatment on the internal structure and, consequently, strength is investigated. Herein, novel bone fracture fixation implants made of titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) manufactured through SLM 3DPT are investigated. The microstructures of the main components of the new modular implant fixation system are assessed, as well as hardness distribution and morphology of the fractures induced in tension and bending. It is found that the implant elements assessed are free from harmful chemicals, and the structures obtained exhibit high strength and present a porous surface that is suitable for osseointegration promotion. In summary, the fabricated titanium implants are expected to be adequate for the treatment of bone fractures.

This study aimed to observe the clinical effects of Tranexamic Acid (TXA) in open reduction and internal fixation of clavicle fractures. Materials and Methods: Forty-six patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation of clavicle fractures were divided into two treatment groups. The observation group (n = 23) received an intravenous (IV) infusion of 0.8 mg TXA 0.5 hr before skin incision, an intraoperative topical injection of 1 mg TXA into the wound and a postoperative IV infusion of 0.8 mg TXA for 3 hrs. The control group (n = 23) did not receive any TXA treatment before, during, or after surgery. Patients in both groups were evaluated for the percentage decrease in red Blood Cell Count (RBC), Haemoglobin level (Hb) and Hematocrit (Hct) as well as the amount of total drainage within 72 hrs after surgery. All 46 patients were followed up and their complete data were collected. Results: Postoperatively, RBC, Hb and Hct levels in the observation group were similar to those in the control group, while the total postoperative drainage in the observation group was considerably lower than that in the control group. Conclusion: For open reduction and internal fixation of clavicle fractures, TXA was not significant in reducing total blood loss and haemoglobin drop but it had a significant reduction in mean postoperative total drainage and transfusion and did not increase the incidence of thrombosis and infection.

However, the system is complex and requiring careful attention to biomechanical principles and good surgical technique. Due to the set of complicate stresses and strains in the LCP system after implantation, the material, which is being used here, is deemed important. However, so far the materials have been limited to the stainless steel (SS) or titanium (Ti). This study was therefore aimed at investigate the biomechanical performance of the internal tibial locked plates at different material properties, including SS, Ti, carbon/polyether ether ketone (PEEK) composite, in treating medial tibial fracture using patient-specific finite element (FE) model of the human tibia. The carbon/PEEK composite materials were used at three different fiber plies configurations. Simulated loading was applied at 60:40 ratios on the medial:lateral aspect. The model was fixed distally in all degrees of freedom. The results revealed the highest stress (307.10 MPa) and the lowest strain (0.14%) at Ti LCP system. The carbon/PEEK LCP system at configuration I and III showed low stress (similar to 60 MPa) and high strain (0.70%), which are suitable points for designing of an internal LCP system. On the other hand, the highest value of stress in callus region was 4.78 MPa (Carbon PEEK/Configuration I) and the strain variations of callus region were between 1.46% and 3.82% among all materials. These results implied the advantage of carbon/PEEK composite materials in LCP system as they can tolerate higher strains at lower stresses.

CS rod material is a promising candidate for internal fixation devices. However, the mechanical strength of existing CS rod materials is still unsatisfactory. In the present work, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were non-covalently functionalized by poly(p-aminophenylacetylene) (PaPA). CS/MWCNTs composite rods were subsequently fabricated via a unique in situ precipitation method. The resultant composite rods were studied in view of their microscopic morphology, crystallinity, mechanical strength, and biocompatibility. Results indicated that the composite rods showed great improvement in mechanical strength and exhibited good biocompatibility, which made the material a promising candidate for bone fracture internal fixation.

In this study, we aimed to compare the reoperation rates for different methodologies of internal fixation for femoral neck fractures in young and middle-aged population. Materials and methods This a retrospective study. A total of 215 patients with displaced femoral neck fractures treated with cannulated screw fixation were enrolled and divided into the sliding compression and length-stable groups according to the fixation pattern. The occurrence of and reason for revision surgery within one year were recorded. Forty-five patients with complete CT data (including CT scanning on the first postoperative day and at the last follow up) were selected from the total sample. A newly established computerized image processing method was used to evaluate variations in the spatial location of screws. Results The reoperation rate was significantly higher in the length-stable group (23.8%) than in the sliding compression group (7.3%). The rate of revision surgery due to nonunion was also higher in the length-stable group (11.4%) than in the sliding compression group (1.8%). However, no significant difference was observed in terms of joint penetration or soft tissue irritation. The sliding compression group (6.58 +/- 3.18 mm) showed higher femoral neck shortening than length-stable group (4.16 +/- 3.65 mm). When analyzing the spatial variations, a significantly greater screw withdrawal distance was observed in the sliding compression group than in the length-stable group, but with a smaller rotation angle. Conclusion Length-stable internal fixation of displaced femoral neck fractures may lead to an increased reoperation rate in young and middle-aged population.

Methods: 108 patients needing oral and maxillofacial surgery in our hospital (2019.01-2021.01) were selected as the research objects, and divided into control group and experimental group according to the random number table, with 54 cases in each group. The control group was treated with conventional interosseous wire ligation, while the experimental group was treated with RIF with titanium plate to effectively evaluate the clinical efficacy and other related indicators of the two groups after surgery. Results: There was no significant difference in intraoperative blood loss between the two groups, but the surgery time, hospitalization time and functional recovery time in the experimental group were significantly shorter than those in the control group. There was a statistical difference in total effective rate between the two groups, and the rate in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group. There was a statistical difference in total incidence of complications between the two groups, and the incidence in the control group was significantly higher than that in the experimental group. In addition, infection, rejecting phenomenon, fracture of fixation material and failure to perform RIF with titanium plate were risk factors affecting the rehabilitation of maxillofacial fractures. Conclusion: The application of RIF with titanium plate has a very significant clinical effect in oral and maxillofacial surgery. It accelerates the recovery of patients and reduces the risk of adverse complications such as postoperative infection and poor functional recovery, which is worthy of clinical promotion.

Mg-Ca-Zn alloy has been suggested for the application of fixation materials during maxillofacial surgery. We investigated the stability of Mg-Ca-Zn alloy for clinical application during orthognathic surgery. The finite element model for the fixation of sagittal split ramus osteotomy was constructed. In the bicortical screw fixation of the mandible setback condition, the stress distributions of Mg-Ca-Za alloy, polylactic acid polymer, and titanium were evaluated using the virtual model with occlusal loading of 132 N. The deformations of the three different materials of fixation screw were observed according to masticatory force ranging from 132 to 1,000 N. When comparing the stress distribution placed on cortical bone between the polymer and magnesium alloy groups, the magnesium alloy screws could bear more stress, thereby decreasing the stress, which might be distributed to other biologic components, such as the condyle and cortical ramus of the mandible. Deformations of the screws according to functional load were minimal, and the deformation remained < 0.21 mm at the initial functional load of the mandible after surgery, regardless of materials used. The biodegradable magnesium alloy screw can bear more stress and decrease the detrimental effect on the stability of sagittal split ramus osteotomy setback surgery.

Closed reduction has been used as the standard treatment modality for nasal fractures for many years. In cases of nasal fracture with lacerations at the fracture sites, bioabsorbable/metallic plate or interfragment wire fixation can be used with accurate alignment through the openings created by the lacerations. However, in cases of severe comminuted nasal fractures that are difficult to drill and fix, this type of fixation may not be feasible. We performed in 5 patients open reduction with internal fixation through laceration openings using the biomaterial Greenplast (Greencross Corporation, Seoul, Republic of Korea; human plasma fibrinogen, thrombin, aprotinin, and calcium chloride) under general anesthesia. Both structural and aesthetic outcomes were satisfactory. Open reduction through laceration openings and internal fixation with fibrin glue under general anesthesia may be a simpler and more effective method than those currently in general use for the repair of complicated comminuted open nasal fractures.

Severe osteoarthritis (OA) of the ankle joint constitutes an important social problem. Objectives. We used (1) the GRIMBY scale, (2) the LOWER LIMB Activity scale, (3) the UCLA (University of California Los Angeles) activity scale, (4) the VAS (visual analogue scale) ACTIVITY scale, and (5) the FAAM (foot and ankle ability measure) SPORT scale to verify whether the type of ankle joint arthrodesis stabilization affected sports and physical activity levels. Material and methods. We carried out a prospective clinical study of 47 patients who had undergone ankle arthrodesis with Ilizarov external fixator stabilization (Group 1, n = 21) or internal stabilization with screws (Group 2, n = 26) at Orthopaedic Clinic at the Wroclaw Medical University, Poland, from 2007 to 2015. Sports and physical activity levels were measured by (1) the GRIMBY scale, (2) the LOWER LIMB Activity scale, (3) the UCLA activity scale, (4) the VAS ACTIVITY scale, and (5) the FAAM SPORT scale. Results. A comparison between the average results of Group 1 and Group 2 on the LOWER LIMB Activity scale and the GRIMBY scale before and after surgery revealed no significant differences. In Group 1, the mean scores on the VAS ACTIVITY scale and the UCLA activity scale after treatment were higher than in Group 2. In Group 1, the mean outcome in the SPORT FAAM scale after treatment was 40; in Group 2 it was 30.06. Conclusions. Ilizarov fixation of ankle arthrodesis is associated with better scores on the FAAM SPORT, UCLA activity and VAS ACTIVITY scales after treatment than internal fixation. The scores on the GRIMBY scale and the UCLA activity scale were significantly higher after treatment than before treatment in both groups. In this study, ankle fusion with Ilizarov fixation and internal fixation was found to be effective in the treatment of ankle arthritis. The levels of sport and physical activity were satisfactory in both groups, but the outcomes after fixation with the Ilizarov apparatus were better than after internal stabilization.

More often than not these patients are subjected to multiple surgeries and are complicated by infection osteomyelitis and poor rehabilitation. There is no consensus in the management of these fractures. Most common mode is to do early fasciotomy with external fixation, followed by second stage definitive fixation. We performed a retrospective study of proximal tibia fractures with impending compartment syndrome treated by single stage fasciotomy and internal fixation. Results in terms of early fracture union, minimum complications and early patient mobilization were very good. Materials and Methods: Fifteen patients who were operated between July 2011 and June 2012 were selected for the study. All documents from their admission until the last followup in December 2013 were reviewed, data regarding complications collected and results were evaluated using Oxford Knee scoring system. Results: At the final outcome, there was anatomical or near anatomical alignment with no postoperative problems with range of motion of near complete flexion (120) in all patients within 3 months. 13 patients started full weight bearing walking at 3 months. Delayed union in two patients and skin necrosis in one patient was observed. Conclusions: Since the results are encouraging and the rehabilitation time is much less when compared to conventional approaches, it is recommended using this protocol to perform early fasciotomy with the definitive internal fixation as single stage surgery to obtain excellent followup results and to reduce rehabilitation time, secondary trauma, expense of treatment and infection rate.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical effects of a novel fixation system we designed. Methods: 12 human cadavers (L3-pelvic-femora) were used to compare biomechanical stability after reconstruction on the same specimens in four conditions: (1) intact, (2) cable system, (3) plate-pedicle screw system, and (4) cable system and plate-pedide screw combination system (combination system). Biomechanical testing was performed on a material testing machine for evaluating the stiffness of the pelvic fixation construct in compression and torsion. Finding: The cable system and plate-pedicle screw system alone may be insufficient to resist vertical shearing and rotational loads; however the combination system for unstable sacroiliac dislocation fractures provided significantly greater stability than single plate-pedicle or cable fixation system. Interpretation: The novel fixation system for unstable sacroiliac dislocation fractures produced sufficient stability in axial compression and axial rotation test in type C pelvic ring injuries. It may also offer a better solution for sacroiliac dislocation fractures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of internal fracture fixation has always been to restore the functional capacity of the broken bone. The principal requirements of operative fracture management, those being anatomical fracture reduction, durable fixation, preservation of biology, promotion of fracture healing and early patient mobilization, have always been crucial but were accomplished to different extents depending on the focus of the specific fracture fixation principle employed. The first successful approach for internal fracture fixation was anatomic open reduction and interfragmentary compression. This secured the fracture fragments, maintained alignment and enabled direct healing of the fracture fragments. However, the highly invasive approach inflicted an immense amount of biologic stress to the area surrounding the fracture site. Modern preferably anatomically pre-contoured locking plates with relative stability of the bone-implant construct enable durable fixation while allowing a less invasive approach that preserves the biology at the fracture site. In contrast to conventional plating, locked plating provides a certain amount of flexibility, which is required to induce the formation of periosteal callus through interfragmentary motion. Most recently the concept of dynamic plating was introduced, which aims to induce more controlled interfragmentary motion and active stimulation of periosteal callus formation. This review article describes the historic development of plating from conventional plating to locked and dynamic plating. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mechanical properties and degradation behavior of the cross-linked unsaturated poly (ester-amide) were measured. Moreover, the hydrolysis behavior of cross-linked unsaturated poly (ester-amide) in 1.0 mol/L NaOH standard solution at room temperature was also studied. At the same time, preliminary biocompatibility under mice skin was evaluated. All the preliminary results suggested that the copolymer might be a potential bone internal fixation material.

Several fixation options were used in the nonunion treatment, including various plate techniques, intramedullary nails and external fixator. We applied our Selfdynamisable internal fixator for the treatment of humeral shaft nonunion after surgical failure and evaluated its clinical outcome. Materials and methods Six patients with persistent atrophic nonunion of the humeral shaft were treated with Selfdynamisable internal fixator. The inclusion criteria were mobile, unstable resistant nonunion of the humeral diaphysis which persisted after surgical treatment for nonunion. All patients were men with a mean age of 32 (27-39) years. The initial fracture treatment was external fixator in two patients and plaster cast for four patients. All cases failed to unite after primary treatment. Plate fixation was resorted for fracture union but failed. The revision surgery consisted of removal of hardware, freshening of bone ends and bone grafting, and internal fixation with a Selfdynamisable internal fixator. Results The average follow-up was 33 months. All the nonunions healed after indexed operation. The average time for union was 5.5 months (range 4-9 months). There was no loosening or breakage of the fixation device. The functional results, according to the scale of Constant and Murlay modified by Ring, were excellent in five and good in one patient. There were no complications of nerve injuries or infections related to the operation. Conclusion Selfdynamisable internal fixator with bone graft for the treatment of recalcitrant humeral shaft nonunion provided successful clinical outcome with minimal complications.

A Review of Hard Palate Fracture Repair Techniques	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							MANAGEMENT STRATEGY; CLASSIFICATION	Purpose: Hard palate trauma is a relatively infrequent occurrence compared with other craniofacial injuries. Several techniques of hard palate fracture repair have been described. To date, there is no consensus on the optimal management of this type of fracture. The purpose of this study was to compile and analyze studies describing hard palate fracture repair techniques with outcomes data. Materials and Methods: A systematic review of the Medline, Scopus, andWeb of Science databases was performed for articles describing hard palate fracture repair techniques. Results: Eight articles were ultimately included in the review. Of the collective 310 fractures reported, postoperative malocclusion occurred in 21 of 235 cases (8.9%) and other complications occurred in 13 of 299 cases (4.3%). The most important variability in technique was the method of palatal vault stabilization. Three studies described wiring techniques, 3 described internal fixation techniques, and 2 described external fixation techniques. Studies describing internal fixation techniques reported higher rates of wound complications. Proponents of rigid internal fixation believe that this technique provides better fracture reduction. External fixation techniques appear to impart low rates of wound complications, but their overall effectiveness remains in question. Conclusions: Hard palate fractures are associated with high rates of malocclusion and wound complications. The most established methods of palatal vault stabilization are closed reduction with wiring and internal plate fixation. Depending on the fracture type, patient comorbidities, and associated injuries, either technique might be preferable in a given circumstance.

However, their strength and stability for fixation in mandibular condylar head fractures remain unclear. This in vitro study aimed to assess the biomechanical strength of u-HA/PLLA screws after the internal fixation of condylar head fractures. To evaluate their biomechanical behavior, 32 hemimandible replicas were divided into eight groups, each consisting of single-screw and double-screw fixations with titanium or u-HA/PLLA screws. A linear load was applied as vertical and horizontal load to each group to simulate the muscular forces in condylar head fractures. Samples were examined for 0.5, 1, 2, and 3-mm displacement loads. Two screws were needed for stable fixation of the mandibular condylar head fracture during biomechanical evaluation. After screw fixation for condylar head fractures, the titanium screws model was slightly more resistant to vertical and horizontal movement with a load for a small displacement than the u-HA/PLLA screws model. There was no statistically significant difference with load for large displacements. The u-HA/PLLA screw has a low mechanical resistance under small displacement loading compared with titanium within the limits of the mandibular head fracture model study.

Although various fixation techniques have been developed, fixation strength and mobility remain daunting challenges to orthopedic surgeons. The goal of this research is to evaluate the biomechanical strength and clinical outcomes of a novel "fishing net" suture fixation procedure. Materials and methods Four finite element models, modified tension-band wiring fixation, anchor suture fixation, basket plate fixation and "fishing net" suture fixation were built to compare the fixing efficacy of "fishing net" suture fixation with three other fixation methods during IPFP fixation. From January 2018 to February 2019, 17 patients who suffered IPFP and treated by "fishing net" suture (FNS) fixation were compared with 20 patients treated by tension-band wiring (TBW) fixation in database and the two groups were evaluated postoperatively using the modified Cincinnati knee rating system. Results Biomechanical evaluation showed that the relative displacement values of proximal patella measured by three pairs of points on both sides of the fracture line were the lowest using the "fishing net" suture fixation, while fixation using tension-band wiring and basket plate showed similar levels of stability that were less desirable than the "fishing net" method. As to clinical outcomes, there were 17 (100%) patients exhibited excellent or good results with no internal fixation failures in the FNS group compared to three internal fixation failures in the TBW group. Conclusion The biomechanical and clinical results suggest that the "fishing net" suture fixation is a viable candidate for fixation of IPFP.

Biomechanical comparison of tension band- and interfragmentary screw fixation with a new implant in transverse patella fractures	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Knee injuries; Patella; Fracture; Internal fixation; Biomechanics	INTERNAL-FIXATION	Aim: The aim of the present study was to compare the primary fixation stability and initial fixation stiffness of two established fixation techniques, the tension band wiring technique and interfragmentary screw fixation, with a mini-screw fragment fixation system in a model of transverse patella fracture. It was hypothesised that the biomechanical loading performance of the fragment fixation system would not significantly differ from the loading characteristics of the two established methods currently investigated. Materials and methods: Ninety-six calf patellae were used in this biomechanical model. A standardized transverse patella fracture was induced and three different fixation methods, including the modified tension band wiring technique, interfragmentary screw fixation. and the mini-screw fragment fixation system, were used for fragment fixation. Specimens were mounted to a loading rig which was secured within a material testing machine. In each fixation group. eight specimens were loaded to failure at a simulated knee angle of either 0 degrees or 45 degrees. Another eight specimens were submitted to a polycyclic loading protocol consisting of 30 cycles between 20 N and 300 N at a simulated knee angle of 0 degrees or 45 degrees. The residual displacement between the first and the last cycle was recorded. Differences in the biomechanical performance between the three fixation groups were evaluated. Results: No significant differences between the three fixation groups were observed in the parameters maximum load to failure and linear fixation stiffness with monocyclic loading. Specimens being loaded at 45 degrees showed significantly lower maximum failure loads and linear stiffness when compared with 0 degrees. During polycyclic loading, no significant differences in the residual displacement were observed between the groups at 0 degrees loading angle, while at 45 degrees. residual displacement was significantly higher with tension band fixation when compared with interfragmentary screw fixation or the fragment fixation system. Conclusion: The biomechanical performance of the fragment fixation system was comparable to interfragmentary screw fixation and superior to the tension band wiring technique. Given the advantages of a system which provides interfragmentary compression and which simplifies fracture fixation after open or closed reduction, we believe the fragment fixation system to be an adequate alternative in the osteosynthesis of transverse patella fractures.

Two 3D-FEA models were created to fixate the impacted maxilla at the Le Fort I level as 2-plate fixation at the piriform rims (IMP-2 model) and 4-plate fixation at the zygomatic buttresses and piriform rims (IMP-4 model). The IMP-2 model contained 225 664 elements and 48 754 nodes and the IMP-4 model consisted of 245 929 elements and 53 670 nodes. The stresses in each maxillary model were computed. The models were loaded on one side, at the molar-premolar region, in vertical, horizontal and oblique directions to reflect the chewing process. It was concluded that the use of 4-plate fixation following Le Fort I advancement Surgery provides fewer stress fields on the maxillary bones and fixation materials than 2-plate fixation from a mechanical point of view.

Artificial polyurethane mandibles were used in this study. The distal segment of the mandible was repositioned in an 8-mm setback position. All mandibles were divided into three groups: Group 1 had a straight plate with a four-hole monocortical fixation, Group 2 had a curved plate with a four-hole monocortical fixation, and Group 3 had a three-inverted L-type bicortical screw fixation. Vertical loads were applied on the incisal edge by a material testing system. The resistance force at 1, 3, 5, and 10 mm of displacement was analyzed. From the experimental results, Group 1 showed significantly lower results than Groups 2 and 3. No significant difference was observed between Groups 2 and 3 at 1, 3, and 5 mm of displacement. However, at 10 mm of displacement, the resistance force of Group 3 was greater than that of Group 2. For BSSROs, this study concluded that curved plate fixation exhibited the same rigidity as the inverted-L bicortical screw fixation did at <= 5 mm displacement.	[Chen, Michael Y.

Yet it remains unclear whether all photons absorbed in the materials can be transferred through the material-biology interface for solar-to-chemical production and whether the presence of materials beneficially affects microbial metabolism. Here we report a microbe-semiconductor hybrid by interfacing the CO2- and N-2-fixing bacterium Xanthobacter autotrophicus with CdTe quantum dots for light-driven CO2 and N-2 fixation with internal quantum efficiencies of 47.2% +/- 7.3% and 7.1% +/- 1.1%, respectively, reaching the biochemical limits of 46.1% and 6.9% imposed by the stoichiometry in biochemical pathways. Photophysical studies suggest fast charge-transfer kinetics at the microbe-semiconductor interfaces, while proteomics and metabolomics indicate a material-induced regulation of microbial metabolism favouring higher quantum efficiencies compared with biological counterparts alone.

The purpose of our study was to describe our early experience and describe the surgical technique. Materials and methods: Seven cases of trans-sacral fixation were identified with a mean patient age of 49-years-old with four females and three males. The diagnosis at the time of trans-sacral fixation was failure of posterior ring fixation in four (three of which had vertical sacral fractures), mal-position of iliosacral (IS) screw in one, failure of fusion of sacroiliac (SI) joint in two. All these cases were augmented with a 4.5 mm reconstruction plate placed in tension posteriorly. Results: At average follow up of 39 months (range 24-75), all patients achieved union. There were no neurological or vascular complications. Two patients required reoperations prior to union. Our current use for this technique is with a 8.0 mm screw (16 mm thread). Conclusions: Initial experience with trans-sacral fixation has proven to be very effective technique to solve the most difficult problems in posterior pelvic ring fixation. We reserve its use to the following indications: nonunion/malunion of the pelvic ring, and sacral fractures.

We hypothesized that using a dual mobility (DM) cup will help to reduce the risk of postoperative instability in this specific context. Material and methods: This was a retrospective study of 33 consecutive patients who underwent DM THA following failed internal fixation of a proximal femur fracture. The clinical assessment consisted of the Postel-Merle d'Aubigne and HHS scores along with an analysis of preoperative and follow-up radiographs. The primary outcome was the occurrence of implant dislocation. Results: At the last follow-up (44 +/- 24 months), 7 patients had died and 0 were lost to follow-up. Only one dislocation had occurred (3%). The mean PMA and HSS scores of 14.8 and 80 respectively were significantly better than the preoperative scores. There were no cases of aseptic loosening. Conclusion: The use of DM cups in the context of THA following failed internal fixation of proximal femur fractures helps to reduce the risk of dislocation. Thus DM cups are recommended in this indication with high risk of postoperative instability. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The first level model combines a modified composite theory in which the bioresorbable constituent moduli and volume fractions are time-dependent, with predictions from a Finite Element (FE) model, but ignores viscoelastic effects. The FE model is used to predict relationships between geometrical constraints (material interfaces), while a theoretical combined elastic modulus is determined using the Reuss model. The composite internal fixation device design comprises Poly-L-lactide and Hydroxyapatite (HA/PLLA) and Titanium. The geometrical relationships established by the static model are combined with the theoretical mathematical model in order to predict the rate of decrease of the elastic modulus of the composite device. The first level model predicts that the composite plate modulus decreases at a rate that appropriately compensates for the increasing modulus of the healing bone during fracture healing. This suggests that the proposed composite fixation plate has a strong potential for improved fracture healing through the reduction of stress shielding while the fracture heals, and the elimination of stress shielding after fracture healing.

Is arthroplasty preferable to internal fixation for the treatment of extracapsular fracture of the upper femur in the elderly?	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Extracapsular hip fracture; Internal fixation; Arthroplasty	UNSTABLE INTERTROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; SLIDING HIP SCREW; TROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; MORTALITY; NAIL; TRIAL; INDEX; COST	Introduction: Although internal fixation is the reference treatment for extracapsular fracture of the upper femur, indications for arthroplasty are broadening, especially in unstable comminutive fracture in fragile bone. The present study hypothesis was that arthroplasty reduces early mortality and morbidity and provides better recovery of autonomy in over-80 year-old patients than does internal fixation. Material and methods: A prospective multicenter study was conducted on 8 sites. Internal fixation was systematically used in 5 centers; arthroplasty was used systematically in 1 center, and reserved for unstable fracture in 2 centers. A total of 697 patients aged over 80 years (mean age, 85 +/- 5 years), presenting with extracapsular fracture, were included; 521 were treated by internal fixation and 176 by arthroplasty. Results were studied on multivariate analysis of ASA score, blood loss, transfusion, and also of treatment modality as an independent factor for early (first 6 months) mortality and morbidity (mechanical, general and nutritional complications) and functional outcome (autonomy and dependence). Results: Overall mortality was 19.2%. Autonomy deteriorated in 56% of patients alive at 6 months and dependence worsened in 44%. Two percent of those managed by internal fixation underwent revision for disassembly (n = 8) or infection (n = 1). Eight percent of those managed by arthroplasty underwent revision for dislocation (n = 4), implant loosening (n = 3) or infection (n = 7). On univariate analysis, mortality was higher in the arthroplasty group (25%) than with internal fixation (17%; P = 0.002), as were blood loss (425 +/- 286 mL versus 333 +/- 223 mL; P < 0.0001), transfusion rate (61% versus 32%; P < 0.0001) and infection (4% versus 0.2%; P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, however, treatment modality no longer showed impact on mortality or on morbidity and autonomy at 6 months. Nutritional status was better conserved at 6 months following arthroplasty, but dependence worsened. Poor preoperative autonomy, ASA score, and nutritional status and time to treatment were independent factors for mortality. Transfusion, associated with onset of mechanical complications, significantly increased dependence. Conclusion: Type of treatment had little impact on mortality, morbidity or functional outcome. Differences seemed more related to preoperative functional and nutritional status. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The study was performed to evaluate, in a Brazilian population, the diameter of the odontoid process and the feasibility of using two 3.5-mm cortical screws for anterior odontoid fracture fixation. Materials and methods Computed tomographic (CT) scans of 88 adult patients (aged 18-78 years) were analyzed; 40 patients (45%) were male (mean age: 43.08 years) and 48 (55%) were female (mean age: 43.39 years). The minimum external and internal anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the odontoid process on sagittal and coronal planes were measured on CT multiplanar reconstructions of the cervical spine. The mean value of the minimum external anteroposterior diameter was 10.83 +/- A 1.08 and 7.53 +/- A 1.10 mm for the minimum internal anteroposterior diameter. The mean value of the minimum external transverse diameter was 9.19 +/- A 0.91 and 6.07 +/- A 1.08 mm for the minimum internal transverse diameter. The mean AP diameter was significantly larger than the mean transverse diameter; 57 (65%) individuals had the minimum external transverse diameter > 9.0 mm that would allow the insertion of two 3.5-mm cortical screws with tapping, and five (6%) individuals had the minimum internal transverse diameter > 8.0 mm that would allow the insertion of two 3.5-mm cortical screws without tapping. The insertion of two 3.5-mm cortical screws was possible for anterior fixation of odontoid fracture in 57 (65%) individuals of our study, and there was no statistical difference between males and females.

This study aimed to compare total laminectomy and pedicle screw internal fixation with ultrasound- and microscope-assisted laminectomy replantation surgery in patients with tumors of the lumbar spinal canal. Material/Methods: A retrospective study was conducted. Sixty patients with tumor spinal canal were admitted to our hospital. Patients in group A (n=32) underwent total laminectomy and pedicle screw internal fixation; patients in group B (n=28) underwent laminectomy replantation with ultrasonic and microscopic assistance. Operative time, intraoperative blood loss, operative segment, length of hospital stay, postoperative length of bed rest, and visual analog scale (VAS) score after surgery were analyzed. Results: Hospital stay and postoperative bed rest time of patients in group B were shorter than those in group A (P=0.004). Intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage volume, and postoperative pain relief of group B were significantly lower than those of group A (P=0.000). There was no significant difference in postoperative pathological results between the 2 groups (P=0.901). Conclusions: Ultrasound- and microscope-assisted laminectomy replantation resulted in the reduced intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage volume, length of hospital stay, and postoperative VAS pain score, compared with total laminectomy and pedicle screw internal fixation for the surgical removal of tumors of the lumbar spinal canal.

J	Ling, ZY; Wu, L; Shi, GL; Chen, L; Dong, QR				Ling, Zhuoyan; Wu, Lei; Shi, Gaolong; Chen, Li; Dong, Qirong			Increased Runx2 expression associated with enhanced Wnt signaling in PDLLA internal fixation for fracture treatment	EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE			English	Article						Poly-D-L lactide material; metal material; fracture healing; runt-related transcription factor 2; canonical Wnt signaling	BONE-DEVELOPMENT; GENE-EXPRESSION; FACTOR-BETA; PROMOTER; DIFFERENTIATION; CHONDROCYTES; CELLS; CBFA1; DEGRADATION; OSTEOBLASTS	Poly-D-L lactide (PDLLA) biodegradable implants to heal fractures are widely applied in orthopedic surgeries. However, whether the process of fracture healing is regulated differently when PDLLA is used compared with traditional metal materials remains unclear. Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and canonical Wnt signaling are essential and may interact reciprocally in the regulation of osteogenesis during bone repair. In the present study, a rat femoral open osteotomy model was used to compare the curative efficacy of a PDLLA rod and Kirschner wire under intramedullary fixation for fracture treatment. The dynamic expression of Runx2 and key components of the canonical Wnt signaling in callus tissue during fracture healing was also investigated. The results of the current study indicate that at weeks 4 and 6 following fixation, the callus bone structural parameters of microCT were significantly improved by PDLLA rod compared to that of Kirschner wire. In addition, at weeks 4 and 6 after fixation, the protein and mRNA expression of Runx2 and the positive regulators of canonical Wnt signaling, such as Wnts and beta-catenin, were significantly increased. However, the protein and mRNA expression levels of the negative regulators of canonical Wnt signaling, such as glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, were significantly decreased in callus tissue when treated with PDLLA rod compared with Kirschner wire. Collectively, these data indicate that compared to the traditional metal material, using PDLLA internal fixation for fracture treatment may further improve bone formation, which is associated with the increased expression of Runx2 and the enhancement of canonical Wnt signaling.

Common internal fracture implants are made of metallic materials, which often affects the imaging quality of CT and MRI. Most patients will choose secondary surgery to remove the internal fixation implants, which causes secondary damage to them. The development of new degradable internal fracture implants has attracted more and more attention from orthopedic surgeons and researchers. Based on these problems, we improved the various properties of medical grade polycaprolactone (PCL) by adding poly(L-lactide) (PLLA). We produced PCL/PLLA strapping bands with different mass ratios by injection molding. We compared the mechanical properties, degradation properties, cell biocompatibility, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) adhesion, proliferation, osteogenic differentiation and fracture fixation effect of these strapping bands. The results showed that the tensile strength and yield force of the strapping bands increased with the increase of the content of PLLA. The addition of PLLA could significantly improve the mechanical strength in the early stage and accelerate the degradation rate of the strapping band. PCL/PLLA (80/20) strapping band had no significant cytotoxicity toward rBMSCs and could promote osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs. The strapping band could ensure femoral fracture healing of beagles in 3 months and didn't cause damage to the surrounding tissues and main organs. This study will provide some new insights into the biodegradable products of PCL/PLLA blends for internal fixation of fracture.Graphical AbstractWe produced novel degradable PCL/PLLA strapping bands with different mass ratios by injection molding. We tested the biological safety of the prepared internal fixation strapping bands for fracture, such as cell experiment in vitro and animal experiment, and studied the degradation behavior in vitro.

Materials and Methods: The aim of the paper is to compare the outcomes of external fixation (EF) with open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) with plates and screw fixation in the treatment of intra-articular fractures of the distal radius. Thirty-five patients were enlisted from December 2003 to September 2005 after a failure of initial conservative treatment. The patients were randomised into EF or ORIF groups. The patients were followed-up at 1 week, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Clinical and radiological outcomes were measured. They were scored using the Green and O'Brien or the Gartland and Wertley score. Results: Of the 35 patients, 5 defaulted the 6-month follow-up and were excluded. We found that the clinical and radiological outcomes for the 2 groups were not significantly different. Complication rates were also similar. Conclusion: There is no significant difference in the outcome of intra-articular distal radius fractures treated with either EF or ORIF.	[Xu, Germaine G.

Inspired by this, 1D AuPd nanospikes (AuPd NSs) composed with internal Au nanowire and external Pd nanohumps were fabricated by a flexible low-temperature wet-chemical method. Benefiting from the excellent electron transport efficiency of the 1D material and the accessible surface area provided by the unique nanospike-like structure, AuPd NSs exhibit outstanding nitrogen reduction reaction performance with an NH3 yield rate of 16.9 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1). and a Faradaic efficiency of 15.9% at -0.3 V under 0.1 M Na2SO4. This work not only provides an effective electrocatalyst for nitrogen fixation technology, but also presents a flexible method for the controlled synthesis of spike-like nanomaterials.

Material/Methods: The bacteriocins were isolated from Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34. Twenty-four New Zealand White female rabbits were divided into 2 groups: bacteriocins and control group. After mandible fracture fixation, the rabbits were infected with S. aureus and subsequently injected with either bacteriocins or saline. The biofilm samples were harvested from rabbits euthanized on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th days and observed using a fluorescence microscope. Blood samples were collected at 1 h, 12 h, 1 day, 3 days, and 5 days after the injection of either bacteriocin or saline to test the level of C-reactive protein and TNF-alpha. Results: Significant differences in the biofilm formation were evident between the bacteriocins and saline treatment group on days 1, 3, and 5. Moreover, the serum levels of TNF-alpha and CRP after treatment with bacteriocins were significantly lower than in controls. Conclusions: Use of bacteriocins isolated from Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34 may be a promising way to control infections of mandible fracture after internal fixation in vivo.

Plates of metal material remain the gold standard. However, they are not the ideal bone plate considering the stress shielding induced by the high elastic modulus and biomechanical mismatch with bone. PLA fracture internal fixation plates present the advantages of matching with the elastic modulus of the bone and absorbable properties but are limited by poor toughness and acidic degradation. Degradable bone plates composed of polylactic acid/hydroxyapatite (PLA/HA) composite were prepared by fused deposition modeling, which had higher bending strength and compressive strength than that of pure PLA. The hydrophilicity of PLA/HA composite was improved by the addition of HA, it was beneficial to the adhesion of cells on the surface of the composite. The results of in vitro degradability showed that the addition of HA can effectively neutralize the acidity generated by PLA degradation. Meanwhile, the addition of HA can improve the cell affinity to promote the adhesion and growth of MC3T3-E1 cells on the surface of the composites. Consequently, the PLA/HA composite shows a good potential as a bone plate to fix bone fractures.

The objective of this study in adults with high-risk mid-shaft clavicle fractures was to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of a minimally invasive surgical technique involving a minimally invasive approach, fracture reduction, temporary intra-operative external fixation, and locking plate internal fixation. Hypothesis: This minimally invasive surgical technique for mid-shaft clavicle fractures ensures satisfactory radiographic fracture healing and medium-term functional outcomes, with a short immobilisation, rapid return to sports, and low complication rate. Material and method: A retrospective review was performed of patients managed using our minimally invasive surgical technique between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2016. The primary outcome measure was the 3-month radiographic healing rate. The secondary outcome measures were duration of post-operative immobilisation, 3- and 6-month QuickDASH scores, and post-operative complications. Result: A total of 19 patients were included, 18 males and 1 female with a mean age of 37 years. Radiographic healing was consistently achieved within 3 months. Immobilisation duration was 3 weeks. The mean QuickDASH score was 23.75 after 3 months and 7.5 after 6 months. Return to sports occurred after 3 months. The only complication was transient paraesthesia in the distribution of the C8 nerve root in 1 patient. Discussion: The management of mid-shaft clavicle fractures remains controversial. The high complication rates associated with conventional surgical techniques make treatment decisions difficult. A surgical technique characterised by temporary intra-operative external fixation to facilitate minimally invasive internal fixation may have a lower complication rate and shorter immobilisation requirements compared to conventional surgery.

Osteoporosis, comminution and bone loss, compromise stability with delayed mobility and poor functional outcomes. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with anatomic distal femoral (DF) locking plate permits early mobilization. However, this usually necessitates bone grafting (BG). Biological fixation using minimally invasive techniques minimizes periosteal stripping and morbidity. Materials and Methods: 31 patients with comminuted periprosthetic DF fractures were reviewed retrospectively from October 2006 to September 2012. All patients underwent fixation using a DF locking compression plate (Synthes). 17 patients underwent ORIF with primary BG, whereas 14 were treated by closed reduction (CR) and internal fixation using biological minimally invasive techniques. Clinical and radiological followup were recorded for an average 36 months. Results: Mean time to union for the entire group was 5.6 months (range 3-9 months). Patients of ORIF group took longer (Mean 6.4 months, range 4.5-9 months) than the CR group (mean 4.6 months, range 3-7 months). Three patients of ORIF and one in CR group had poor results. Mean knee society scores were higher for CR group at 6 months, but nearly identical at 12 months, with similar eventual range of motion. Discussion: Locked plating of comminuted periprosthetic DF fractures permits stable rigid fixation and early mobilization. Fixation using minimally invasive biological techniques minimizes morbidity and may obviate the need for primary BG.	[Thukral, Rajiv; Marya, S. K.

In this study, we used titanium mesh to treat comminuted mandibular fractures. Materials and Methods: Nine patients with traumatically comminuted mandibular fractures who received open reduction and internal stable fixation with titanium mesh were retrospectively reviewed. Open reduction-internal stable fixation was performed 7 to 10 days after primary debridement of the facial trauma. After the fractured mandible and the displaced fragments were reduced, the titanium mesh was reshaped according to the morphology of the mandible, and the reduced bone fragments were fixed with the reshaped titanium mesh and screws. Then, the surgical effects were evaluated during routine follow-up. Results: Most of the displaced fragments were preserved and exhibited a favorable shaping ability in restoring the morphology of the mandible during surgery. No intraoperative complications were encountered. In addition, all patients were infection free, with no obvious resorption in the fixed fragments after surgery. The mandible also exhibited favorable morphology and offered sufficient bone mass for dental implantation or a denture prosthesis. Conclusions: We conclude that titanium mesh shaping and fixation can effectively treat comminuted mandibular fractures with little bone fragment loss, little soft tissue exposure, a low infection rate, and favorable mandibular morphology.

This study compared open and closed treatments and assessed the results with a meta-analysis. Materials and methods: A literature search of PubMed found eight studies that met the search criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Results: The studies increasingly suggest better results for open treatment, in terms of mouth opening, protrusion, laterotrusion, pain, and malocclusion. In the meta-analysis, the outcome was significantly better for laterotrusion and protrusion in patients treated by open reduction and internal fixation. Conclusion: Due to the different study protocols and lack of information on classification, follow-up time, and inclusion criteria, comparison of the studies remains difficult and further prospective, randomized studies should examine these issues.

J	Chaudhuri, S				Chaudhuri, Sibaji			Closed reduction, internal fixation with quadratus femoris muscle pedicle bone grafting in displaced femoral neck fracture	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Avascular necrosis of femoral head; closed reduction internal fixation; femoral neck fracture; muscle pedicle bone graft; quadratus femoris muscle pedicle bone grafting	AVASCULAR NECROSIS; YOUNG-ADULTS; HEAD; HEMIARTHROPLASTY; FEMUR; END; HIP	Background: Management of femoral neck fracture is still considered as an unsolved problem. It is more evident in displaced fractures where this fracture is considered as some sort of vascular insult to the head of the femur. We have used closed reduction, internal fixation and quadratus femoris muscle pedicle bone grafting in fresh displaced femoral neck fractures. Materials and Methods: From April 1996 to December 2004 we operated 73 consecutive patients of displaced femoral neck fracture in the age group of 24 to 81 years, mean age being 54.6 years. The patients were operated within one week of injury, the mean delay being 3.6 days. Closed reduction internal fixation along with quadratus femoris muscle pedicle bone grafting was done in all cases. They were followed up for an average period of 5.6 years (range 2-11 years). Results: Results were assessed according to modified Harris Hip Scoring system and found to be excellent in 53, good in 12, fair in six and poor in two patients. Bony union occurred in 68 cases, no patient developed avascular necrosis (AVN) till date. Conclusion: For fresh displaced femoral neck fracture in physiologically active patients closed reduction, internal fixation and quadratus femoris muscle pedicle bone grafting is a suitable option to secure union and prevent development of AVN.

William			Biomechanical <i>in vitro</i> evaluation of three stable internal fixation techniques used in sagittal osteotomy of the mandibular ramus: a study in sheep mandibles	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ORAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Mandible; Osteotomy; Bone plates; Bone screws	POLY-L-LACTIDE; SPLIT OSTEOTOMY; SCREW FIXATION; FUNCTIONAL STABILITY; SKELETAL STABILITY; POSITION SCREWS; ADVANCEMENT; PLATES; CONFIGURATION	Among the osteotomies performed in orthognathic surgery, the sagittal osteotomy of the mandibular ramus (SOMR) is the most common, allowing a great range of movements and stable internal fixation (SIF), therefore eliminating the need of maxillomandibular block in the postoperative period. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical resistance of three national systems used for SIF in SOMR in sheep mandibles. Material and methods: The study was performed in 30 sheep hemi-mandibles randomly divided into 3 experimental groups, each containing 10 hemi-mandibles. The samples were measured to avoid discrepancies and then subjected to SOMR with 5-mm advancement. In group I, 2.0x12 mm screws were used for fixation, inserted in an inverted "L" pattern (inverted "L" group). In group II, fixation was performed with two 2.0x12 mm screws, positioned in a linear pattern and a 4-hole straight miniplate and four 2.0x6.0 mm monocortical screws (hybrid group). In group III, fixation was performed with two-hole straight miniplates and eight 2.0x6.0 mm monocortical screws (mini plate group). All materials used for SIF were supplied by Osteosin - SIN. The hemimandibles were subjected to vertical linear load test by Kratos K2000MP mechanical testing unit for loading registration and displacement. Results: All groups showed similar resistance during mechanical test for loading and displacement, with no statistically significant differences between groups according to analysis of variance. Conclusion: These results indicate that the three techniques of fixation are equally effective for clinical fixation of SOMR.

We performed open reduction and internal fixation of a fibula fracture followed by fixation of the tibiofibular joint with an olive wire and one half of an external fixator. We present a review of 1 patient treated with this material. We believe this method to be a physiologic fixation system with the advantage of being safe, inexpensive, adjustable, and effective; however, further clinical investigation and comparison to other methods is needed in order to better understand it clinical utility.

Pre-contoured distal femoral locking plates are the most commonly used implants for fixation. However, healing problems such as delayed union, failure of fixation, and /or nonunion are not uncommon. The fixation construct being "too stiff" is a commonly quoted reason when nonunion/failure of fixation occurs on distal femur fractures fixed with a plate. A flexible fixation construct allowing controlled axial micromotion could help stimulate the bone healing. In order to achieve this goal, plating construct stiffness can be modified by several methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Patients and methods: We retrospectively compared the outcomes of 58 Akin osteotomies performed by a single surgeon using suture fixation and 39 Akin osteotomies performed by the same surgeon using staple fixation during the same period. Results: Bone union at the osteotomy site was achieved in all cases with no cases of complications related to the materials used. Occurrence of breakage of the lateral cortex of the proximal phalanx showed no significant difference between the suture and staple groups. The lateral cortex breakage produced greater instability at the osteotomy site with the staple fixation compared to the suture fixation. Conclusions: Comparison of suture and staple fixations of Akin osteotomy demonstrated the superiority of suture fixation against staple fixation in terms of stability and cost-efficiency.

Membranous bone taken from the cranium is clearly superior to rib or iliac crest when used as autografting material to the craniofacial skeleton. Conventionally, the bone graft is rigidly fixated to the recipient nasal bone with either metal plate-screw systems or Kirschner wires. Reported here are the results of a single biodegradable screw fixation of the split calvarial graft that is used for nasal reconstruction. Ten patients with moderate to severe saddle nose deformity underwent reconstruction using the open rhinoplasty approach. The graft was harvested from the outer cortex of the parietal bone, shaped, and secured in place with a single bioresorbable screw. No significant resorption has been observed in the grafts and a favorable aesthetic result was achieved in all of the cases. Described modification in fixation of the bone graft in nasal reconstruction avoids some of the disadvantages of permanent materials while preserving the advantages of rigid fixation.

Delays in diagnosis and inadequate treatment for acute scaphoid fractures can lead to nonunions and subsequent degenerative wrist arthritis. Improvements in diagnosis, surgical treatment, and implant materials have encouraged a trend toward early internal fixation, even for nondisplaced scaphoid fractures that could potentially be treated nonoperatively. Despite the advent of newly developed fixation techniques, including open and percutaneous fixation, the nonunion rate for scaphoid fractures remains as high as 10% after surgical treatment. Scaphoid nonunions can present with or without avascular necrosis of the proximal pole and may show a humpback deformity on the radiograph. If left untreated, scaphoid nonunions can progress to carpal collapse and degenerative arthritis. Surgical treatment is directed at correcting the deformity with open reduction and internal fixation with bone grafting Recently, vascularized bone grafts have gained popularity in the treatment of scaphoid nonunions, particularly in cases with avascular necrosis. This article reviews current concepts regarding the treatment of scaphold fractures and nonunions.

Commercially available, expensive QC materials have short shelf lives and may not be suitable in resource-poor settings. We compared different methods for preparing homemade QC material, including fixation with 1%, 2%, or 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA); freezing with 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), 0.1% bovine serum albumin-phosphate buffered saline, or after ethanolic dehydration; and using cryopreservation temperatures of -20 degrees C, -80 degrees C, or -196 degrees C. We found an optimal experimental condition, which is 'fixation with 4% PFA, freezing with 10% DMSO, and storage at 80 degrees C'. To evaluate long-term stability of QC materials prepared in this optimal condition, two levels of QC materials (QM1 and QM2) were thawed after 30, 33, 35, 37, 60, 62, 64, and 67 days of cryopreservation. Lymphocyte subset was analyzed with BD Multitest IMK kit (BD Biosciences, USA).

We propose this method as an alternative cost-effective protocol for preparing homemade internal QC materials for lymphocyte subset analysis in resource-poor settings.

Femoral shortening does not impair functional outcome after internal fixation of femoral neck fractures in non-geriatric patients	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Hip fracture; Femoral neck fracture; Femoral shortening; Internal fixation; Non-geriatric patients; Leg length discrepancy	TERM-FOLLOW-UP; ARTHROPLASTY; MANAGEMENT; MULTICENTER; SCREWS	Introduction Aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and extent of femoral shortening in non-geriatric patients after internal fixation of femoral neck fractures in relation to the clinical outcome at mid-term follow-up. Materials and methods Reviewing our admission data, we identified non-geriatric patients (18-65years) with femoral neck fractures treated with either dynamic hip screw or cancellous screws between 2007 and 2015. Patients were then contacted and invited to a follow-up clinical investigation including whole-leg standing X-rays. Results A total of 40 patients with a mean age at surgery of 529years returned for the follow-up examination. Overall, 31 patients (77.5%) had undergone a dynamic hip screw fixation, while 9 patients were treated with cancellous screws (22.5%). The median follow-up time was 65.5months (5.5years). We observed shortening of the ipsilateral femur neck in the majority of cases (92.5%). Still, functional outcome in the overall study population was excellent with a median Harris Hip Score of 96. Conclusions Femoral neck shortening is common in non-geriatric patients after internal fixation of femoral neck fractures. Nonetheless, observed excellent functional outcome at mid-term follow-up supports joint-preserving strategies in non-geriatric femoral neck fractures.

Thirty male adult rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus were used. Unilateral mandibular osteotomies were perfortried between the canine and first premolar. The animals were divided into two groups: for Group I-rigid internal fixation was performed with titanium system 1.5 mm (Synthes, Oberdorf, Switzerland), with two screws of 6 mm (bicortical) on each side of the osteotomy. For Group 11-rigid internal fixation was performed with PLLA/PGA systerri 1.5 mm (Lacto Sorb(R), WLorenz, Jacksonville, FL, USA). The histological analysis evaluated the presence of inflammatory reaction, degree of bone healing and degree of resorption of the Lacto Sorb(R) screws. The results of both fixation systems were similar, only with a small difference after 15 and 30 days. In Group I a faster bony healing was noted. But after 60 days, bony healing was similar in both groups. It is concluded that both PLLA/PGA and titanium plates and screws provide sufficient strength to permit mandibular bone healing. The resorption process of PLLA/PGA osteosynthesis material did not cause acute or chronic inflammatory reaction or foreign body reaction during the studied period.

However, due to the unique anatomical and blood supply characteristics of the talus, the traditional approaches tend to lead to blood supply damage. In order to best preserve the blood supply of the talus, we proposed a surgical approach of internal fixation of the talar fracture with lateral malleolar osteotomy and analyzed its efficacy. Material/Methods: Twenty-six patients with talar fractures underwent open reduction surgery between January 2010 and December 2016. Following the lateral malleolar osteotomy, the talus was fully exposed. After anatomical reduction, the talus was fixed with 2 screws, and the lateral malleolus was fixed with distending wires. The treatment effects were assessed in the follow-up. Results: All patients were followed for 7 to 22 months, for an average of 14.34 months. According to the Maryland Foot Score, 19 cases were excellent (90-100 points), 4 cases were good (85-90 points), and 3 cases were moderate (50-74 points). Conclusions: Internal fixation of talar fractures with lateral malleolar osteotomy is a viable surgical approach to reduce injury to blood supply and maximize surgical exposure.

In the present study, 36 male beagle dogs were randomly assigned to two groups: PLLA/PLLA-gHA (PLLA-grafted hydroxyapatite) group and PLLA group. PLLA/PLLA-gHA and PLLA plates were embedded in the muscular bags of the erector spinae and also implanted to fix mandibular bone fractures in respective groups. At 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postoperatively, the PLLA/PLLA-gHA and PLLA plates were evaluated by adsorption and degradation tests, and the mandibles were examined through radiographic analysis, biomechanical testing, and histological analysis. The PLLA/PLLA-gHA plates were non-transparent and showed a creamy white color, and the PLLA plates were transparent and faint yellow in color. At all time points following surgery, adsorption and degradation of the PLLA/PLLA-gHA plates were significantly less than those of the PLLA plates, and the lateral and longitudinal bending strengths of the surgically treated mandibles of the beagle dogs in the PLLA/PLLA-gHA group were significantly greater than those of the PLLA group and reached almost the value of intact mandibles at 12 months postoperatively. Additionally, relatively rapid bone healing was observed in the PLLA/PLLA-gHA group with the formation of new lamellar bone tissues at 12 months after the surgery. The PLLA/PLLA-gHA nano-composite can be employed as a biodegradable material for internal fixation of mandibular bone fractures.

This type of fracture, also known as Hoffa-like fracture of the tibial plateau, shares a similar mechanism of injury with the Hoffa fracture of the femoral condyle. In the field of orthopedics, finite element analysis is considered a valuable method to guide clinical decision-making. In this study, four methods used for internal fixation of Hoffa-like fractures of the tibial plateau were compared using computer simulation and applying a finite element method (FEM). The methods compared were lateral L-plate fixation alone (Model A); lateral L-plate combined with posterior anti-slip plate (reconstruction plate/T-plate) fixation (Model B); lateral L-plate combined with posterior hollow nail fixation of the fracture block (Model C); and lateral L-plate combined with anterior hollow nail fixation of the fracture (Model D). The maximum displacement of the model and the maximum stress of the internal fixation material were analyzed by applying an axial load of 2,500 N. The results showed that, in the normal bone model, the maximum displacement of the fracture in Model A was 0.60032 mm, with improved stability through the addition of posterior lateral plate fixation in Model B and reduction of the displacement to 0.38882 mm. The maximum displacement in Model C and Model D was comparable, amounting to 0.42345 mm and 0.42273 mm, respectively. Maximum stress was 1235.6 MPa for Model A, 84.724 MPa for Model B, 99.805 MPa for Model C, and 103.19 MPa for Model D. In the internal fixation analysis of the osteoporotic fracture model, we observed patterns similar to the results of the normal bone model. The results indicated that Model B yielded the overall best results in the treatment of Hoffa-like fractures of the tibial plateau. The orthopedic surgeon may wish to implement these insights into the perioperative algorithm, thereby refining and optimizing clinical patient care. In addition, our findings pave the way for future research efforts.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether absorbable internal fixation can provide adequate mechanical stability and a reduction in the incidence of failure of fixation caused by bone loss and stress shielding. Methods: A low density cancellous bone model was selected to compare the insertion of screw (screw-in), removal of screw (screw - out) and pull - out strength of absorbable screw and metal screw. The long bone model of thin cortical bone was used to create the transverse fracture model. The model was fixed with absorbable plate-screw system and metal plate-screw system respectively. The fatigue test and static bending test were compared. Moreover, the size of screw hole area was assessed. Results: The maximal screw - in and screw - out torque of the absorbable screw was significantly greater than that of the metal screw (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in pull-out test (P > 0.05). No visible failure occurred in fatigue test. There was no significant difference between the maximum load of static bending test (P > 0.05). The screw hole area of absorbable samples was significantly smaller than that of metal samples (P < 0.05). Conclusions: In this experimental set-up it was found that the stability of absorbable screws in osteoporotic bone was better than metal screws. The absorbable system tested can achieve good stability, and the destruction of osteoporotic bone is small, which can reduce the occurrence of bone failure. Considering that absorbable material avoids the need of second surgery (implant removal) and reduces the stress shielding effect, we believe that absorbable internal fixation can be considered for fixation treatment of osteoporotic fractures.

INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Cerclage wiring fixation; distal femoral fracture; locking plate; open reduction	PERIPROSTHETIC FEMUR FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; SHAFT FRACTURES; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; REDUCTION; EVOLUTION	Purpose: We aimed to determine the efficacy of cerclage wiring by comparing the clinical and radiological results between internal fixation with locking plates after distal femoral fracture reduction with or without cerclage wiring. Materials and Methods: One hundred and one patients who received open reduction internal fixation for distal femoral fractures of oblique, spiral, and spiral wedge type between 2007 and 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. Only locking plate fixation was performed in 46 patients, and locking plate fixation with additional cerclage wiring was performed in 55 patients (Group CW). Demographic, clinical, and radiologic factors were evaluated in both the groups. Age, gender, bone mineral density, bone graft, and the presence of concomitant fractures were measured as demographic factors. The range of motion of knee joint, Lysholm knee score, visual analog scale score, procedure time, and C-arm time were measured as clinical factors preoperatively and at the final followup. We also evaluated the duration of bone union and knee joint alignment radiologically. Results: There were no demographic differences between the two groups. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of clinical and radiological parameters. However, the procedure time used was significantly longer in Group LP than in Group CW (108.4 vs. 95.2 min; P= 0.027). The C-arm time was longer in Group LP (2.8 vs. 1.2 s; P= 0.017). Conclusions: Open reduction and locking plate fixation with additional cerclage wiring is a useful method for the reduction of complicated distal femoral fractures, without increased complications such as nonunion. Level of Evidence: Level III, retrospective cohort design, treatment study.

Composite materials based on PLLA and bioactive glass (BG) were prepared by a moulding method and the screws were machined from the composites. The biocompatibility in vivo of PLLA/BG composite material was evaluated by haematoxylin and eosin staining, and the bone-bonding ability of PLLA/BG composite was also performed by using tetracycline staining, Von Kossa staining, Alizarin S red staining and Masson's trichromatic staining. Tissue responses evaluated for 1 to 12 weeks revealed that PLLA/BG implants were tissue tolerant and had nonbacterial inflammatory. PLGA/BG composite showed better histological compatibility than PVC implant in the in vivo study. A good ability of bone-bonding of PLLA/BG was determined by implantation into rabbit muscle and femoral condyle, and the mineralization appeared around the PLLA/BG implant materials. The results showed that PLLA/BG composites have good biocompatibility as absorbable materials for internal fracture fixation.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the treatment outcomes of 2 surgical techniques to determine the better method for repairing open DHFs. Both groups were treated with immediate debridement first, and then group I had only internal fixation (IF), while group II underwent initial external fixation (EF) followed by IF surgery. Material/Methods: This retrospective study included 32 patients who had open DHFs between 2013 and 2018. Twelve patients underwent thorough debridement and temporary EF treatment and converted to IF as the ultimate treatment. Twenty patients were treated with immediate open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). Data of final treatment outcomes were analyzed at the latest follow-up. A comparative analysis of radiological results, function observations, and complications was performed for the 2 surgical groups. Results: All DHFs and osteotomized olecranon united after a mean of 5.2 +/- 1.21 months. No significant differences were observed in other preoperative demographic data between the 2 groups. Moreover, there was no significant difference in postoperative complications, elbow range of motion, or fracture healing time between the 2 groups. Conclusions: The evidence provided by our study highlights the efficacy of definitive IF in treating open DHFs, which is recommended whenever possible. Furthermore, the combination of EF and ORIF, according to the type of soft tissue damage, may be a promising treatment option with a low revision rate for patients with open DHFs.

Literature on PPFN management is scarce. The study aim was to review combined results of two academic teaching hospitals using comparable PPFN treatment strategies. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of all patients treated for a PPFN between February 2005 and December 2016. All patients treated with internal fixation for a PPFN with complete clinical and radiological follow-up until healing were included. Nineteen patients were identified (mean age 71.2 years, range 49-87). Treatment consisted of failed hardware removal, debridement, reduction, and rigid internal fixation with or without bone graft. For revision PPFN surgery, use of dual-plating and bone graft augmentation was common. Results: Eighteen of 19 patients (94.7%) progressed to osseous union. One patient was converted to a total femoral prosthesis. No patients were lost to follow-up. All were ambulatory at last follow-up and mean follow-up was 39.8 months. Fourteen patients (73.7%) united after our index nonunion surgery at mean 9.8 months. Five patients (26.3%) required revision surgery after our index nonunion treatment and in 4 of these cases union was achieved at mean 18.0 months. Conclusions: Our results suggest debridement, revision of fixation and liberal use of bone grafting can lead to reliable healing in the majority of PPFNs. For those PPFNs that do not heal following initial treatment, good healing potential persists with an additional procedure. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Considering that the elderly often suffer from osteoporosis, the safety and efficacy of internal fixation are particularly important. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of osteoporosis on internal fixation after spinal osteotomy. Methods: One patient with a thoracolumbar kyphotic deformity who underwent spinal osteotomy was included. The CT images of the entire spine were used to construct a finite element model of the spine internal fixation after osteotomy. Material parameters were assigned to osteoporosis and normal bone groups, and the loads were used to simulate different working conditions, including axial compression, flexion, extension and lateral bending. Findings: Compared with normal bone mass, the pressure on osteotomized vertebrae was reduced by 8.32%, 1.92%, 36.79% and 79.80% in mild osteoporosis model during axial compression, flexion, extension and lateral bending, respectively. The pressure on screws and rods was increased in an osteoporosis model under axial compression. During flexion and lateral bending, the pressure on screws was increased but was decreased on rods. The opposite result was found during extension. With the degree of osteoporosis increases, the change of stress is more obvious. Interpretation: Under different bone mass conditions, the distribution patterns of stress in vertebrae, screws and rods were relatively similar. Collectively, the stress levels of vertebral bone were decreased and the stress levels of the screw/rod system were increased in an osteoporosis model compared to a normal bone model. Hence, osteoporosis may increase the risk of fracture and internal fixation failure.

Materials and Methods: A total of 32 patients with displaced unilateral condylar fractures were included in the present study. Of the 32 patients, 27 were men and 5 were women. The patients were divided into 2 groups. The group I patients were treated with closed treatment and rigid maxillomandibular fixation, and group II patients were treated with open reduction and internal fixation. The patients were assessed for maximal interincisal opening, protrusive movements, lateral excursion movements on the fractured and nonfractured sides, anatomic reduction of the condyle on radiography, pain in the temporomandibular joint, and malocclusion. Parameters such as the maximal interincisal opening, protrusive movements, and lateral excursion movements on the fractured and nonfractured sides between the 2 groups were compared statistically using an independent t test. Parameters such as anatomic reduction of the condyle, pain in the temporomandibular joint, and malocclusion between the 2 groups were compared statistically using the chi(2) test. Results: No significant difference was found between the 2 groups in the maximal interincisal opening, protrusion, lateral excursion movement,, malocclusion, and temporomandibular joint pain; however, a statistically significant difference was seen in the anatomic reduction of the condyle. Conclusions: The results of the present study have shown that no significant clinical difference exists between patients undergoing closed treatment and rigid maxillomandibular fixation or open reduction and internal fixation. However, a radiographically better anatomic reduction of the condylar process was seen in the patients treated with open reduction and internal fixation.

They were 17-61 (average 38.5) years old. In terms of the Johnston-Mason classification, two cases were type II, seven cases were type III, and two cases were type IV. All patients were treated with open reduction and anchor internal fixation.ResultsAll 11 patients were followed up, all incisions healed by first intention, and the duration of follow-up was 14-20 months. The average operation time was 40 +/- 15 min. The clinical healing time was 4-6 (average 5) weeks. No patients had any complications, such as traumatic arthritis, malunion, nerve injury, joint stiffness, or incision infection. The clinical effects were evaluated according to the Mayo Elbow Performance Score. The scores of all 11 cases were 90-95, all excellent.ConclusionThe application of suture anchor internal fixation in the treatment of RHFs has the advantages of accurate reduction, no need for a secondary operation to remove the fixation materials, less trauma, fewer complications, good fracture healing, and good recovery of elbow extension, flexion, and rotation functions.

This study investigated therapeutic effects of internal fixation with Kirschner wire and bone grafting via limited tarsal sinus incision in pediatric DIACF. Material/Methods: This retrospective study included pediatric DIACF patients admitted to our department from June 2010 to February 2014. Patients were divided into Sanders II, Sanders III, and Sanders IV groups. Patients were also divided into pre-operation and post-operation groups. All patients underwent the internal fixation with Kirschner wire and bone grafting via limited tarsal sinus incision operation. Bohler angles, Gissane angles, and modified American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society Score (AOFAS) were evaluated. Results: Four weeks after surgery, all patients had clinical healing and no complications appeared. According to CT and X-ray results, the operation had satisfactory reduction effects for pediatric DIACF of childhood and adolescence. The operation significantly enhanced the Bohler angle of patients in Sanders II, III, and IV patients in the post-operation group compared to the pre-operation group (p<0.05). The operation significantly increased Gissane angle in the post-operation group compared to the pre-operation group in Sanders II, III, and IV patients (p<0.05). The operation significantly improved AOFAS scores of patients in the Sanders II, III, and IV groups (p<0.05). Conclusions: Internal fixation with Kirschner wire and bone grafting via limited tarsal sinus incision approach is safe and effective for pediatric DIACF. This approach exhibited advantages of satisfactory reduction for articular surface, solid fixation, and no complications due to infection or tissue necrosis.

When the screw is submitted to pullout strength, it causes internal tension near the medullar canal and this situation can be analyzed by using the photoelasticity technique. Objective: Were analyzed those internal tensions near the medullar canal of photoelastic vertebra models using different sizes of screws of the vertebral fixation system submitted to pullout strength. Methods: A lumbar vertebral model made of photoelastic material with three different USS1-type pedicular screw sizes (5, 6, and 7 mm) was used. The internal tensions around the screw were tested in 12 predetermined points by a plain transmission polaroscope. Results: The areas of greater tension concentration were between the medullar canal and the curves of the transverse process. Comparing the maximum average pulling tension, statistical differences were observed between screws 5 and 7, and 6 and 7. On the other hand, for screws 5 and 6, there were no significant differences. Conclusion: The study evidenced that the internal tensions are greater in irregular areas, next to the medullar canal, showing that this is a critical region.

In this study, therefore, we prepared a biodegradable plate enabled with X-ray visibility by attaching a radiopaque layer on a biodegradable fixation plate in clinical use (Inion, Finland). A radiopaque layer was made of a fine powder of a radiopaque agent, beta-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) and a biodegradable binder material, poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), which were physically mixed without change in their chemical structure. The radiopacity increased as we increased the layer thicknesses from 0.5 mm to 1.3 mm. Regardless of layer thickness, however, the radiopacity decreased with time both in vitro and in vivo due to decreasing density of TCP in the layer by swelling and degradation of a binder material, PLGA. The in vivo study with rabbits revealed that a discernible image of the radiopaque plate could be obtained by X-ray for up to 21 days, also showing the overall biocompatibility 6 months after implantation. Therefore, we conclude that the radiopaque plate prepared in this work is a promising fixation device enabled with both X-ray visibility and biodegradability. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Material and Methods: From February 2013 to December 2015, 11 mallet fingers treated by the modified suture technique were included in this retrospective study. Of these patients, 8 were men and 3 were women. The ring finger was the most commonly injured digit (5 cases), followed by the middle (3 cases), little (2 cases), and index (one case) finger. The follow-up period ranged between 4 and 25 months (mean: 14.9 months). Results: During the final follow-up period, patients had a mean extensor lag of 5.5 degrees (range, 0 to 10 degrees) and a mean flexion of 64 degrees (range, 50 to 80 degrees) at the DIP joint. Using Crawford's criteria, 5 digits were graded as excellent, 6 as good. Neither the pin tract infections nor the skin compressive ulcers occurred. Conclusions: The modified internal suture with transarticular Kirschner wire fixation technique provided an accurate anatomical fixation and acceptable treatment modality for the treatment of tendinous mallet finger deformities.

Orthopedic Implant-Associated and Central Venous Catheter-Associated Infections Caused by <i>Microbacterium</i> spp. in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System from 2000 to 2020	SURGICAL INFECTIONS			English	Article						Corynebacterium; internal fixators; prosthesis-related infections; Veterans Affairs	CORYNEFORM GROUP-A-4; PERITONEAL-DIALYSIS; ENDOPHTHALMITIS	Background: A 72-year-old male developed a late-onset infection of an internal fixation device caused by Microbacterium oxydans. Although often considered contaminants, bacteria from the genus Microbacterium may also be pathogens. We also summarize cases from the Veteran Health Administration (VHA) from which Microbacterium isolates were recovered and review the relevant literature. Patients and Methods: Using the national VHA database, we identified patients with cultures that grew Microbacterium spp. We also review published clinical reports describing Microbacterium spp. as a cause of infections. Results: Between January 2000 and September 2020, 18 cases had Microbacterium spp. Of those, Microbacterium isolates were regarded as pathogens for seven cases; all involved prosthetic material that was consequently removed. Two patients had internal fixation devices whereas the remaining five were patients with a central venous catheter. Conclusions: For patients with prosthetic material, recovery of Microbacterium spp. from device-related clinical cultures should prompt consideration of device removal when possible.

An Economic Analysis of Direct Costs of Distal Radius Fixation and the Implications of a Disposable Distal Radius Kit	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC TRAUMA			English	Article						distal radius fracture; cost analysis; open reduction and internal fixation; ORIF; disposable implant	UNITED-STATES; FRACTURES; EPIDEMIOLOGY; NATIONWIDE; OUTCOMES	Objective: To assess the direct costs of distal radius fracture volar plate (VP) fixation and to create a model to examine the effect of these cost drivers. Materials and Methods: Retrospectively, 744 distal radius fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) were identified. The outcomes assessed included (1) the direct costs related to distal radius ORIF and (2) if a VP alone was amenable. Costs were represented as a cost ratio relative to the average cost of distal radius ORIF, where the average value is set as 1.0. Simulation models were run with all cost drivers (sex, age, open fracture, intra-articular fracture, and ancillary fixation) and with only ancillary fixation as a cost driver. Results: The cost ratio ranged from 0.61 to 1.81 and ancillary fixation was associated with increased implant costs in multivariable analysis. In the simulations, the cost ratio ranged from 0.96 to 1.23 when all cost drivers were included and from 0.99 to 1.20 if only ancillary fixation was included as a cost driver, a reduction of the range by 22.2%. Older patients, females, closed fractures, and extra-articular fractures were more amenable to VP fixation alone. Conclusions: Eighty-three percent of the surgically treated distal radius fractures were treated with VP fixation alone. A disposable kit could help limit cost variance per case by roughly 22%, as only ancillary fixation varies these costs. Closed fractures and extra-articular fractures in older patients or female patients are more amenable to VP fixation alone.	[Lans, Jonathan; Westenberg, Ritsaart F.; Verhiel, Svenna H. W.

This represents a growing public health concern in a climate of cost containment. The purpose of this study is to analyze national trends in surgical management of humeral shaft fractures and determine factors predictive of surgical intervention. Materials and methods Humeral shaft fractures were identified by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 812.21 and 812.31 in the United States Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2002 to 2011. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) was identified by code 79.31 (ORIF, humerus). Other case codes analyzed were 79.01 (closed reduction without internal fixation), 79.11 (closed reduction with internal fixation), and 79.21 (open reduction without internal fixation). Multivariate regression analysis was utilized to determine predictive factors for utilization of ORIF. Results 27,908 humeral shaft fractures were identified. Utilization of ORIF increased from 47.2% of humeral shaft fractures in 2002 to 60.3% in 2011. Demographically, patients who underwent ORIF were younger (51.5 versus 59.7 years, p < 0.001; odds ratio 0.87 per decade of age). There were modest increases in ORIF usage with private insurance, open fracture, and hospital size, which persisted with multivariate regression analysis. Surprisingly, there was a tendency to shift from a slight increase in ORIF for males with the bivariate case to a slight preference for females in the multivariate case. Conclusion Utilization of ORIF for humeral shaft fractures has been steadily increasing with time. Surgical intervention was more common with younger patients, female gender, private insurance, and larger hospital size. The increasing incidence of surgical management for humeral shaft fractures may represent a public health burden given the historical success of non-operative management.

Their treatment is currently surgical. Many therapeutic procedures have been described.Our aim is to evaluate the results of open surgery and to compare the two internal fixation methods used: lag screw versus plates.Materials and methodsThis is a retrospective comparative study of two series of tibial plateau fractures Schatzker types II and III treated surgically over a period of ten years with two different methods:Group A: Internal fixation using screws for 86 patients.Group B: Internal fixation using plates for 71 patients.Functional and anatomical results were assessed according to Rasmussen's clinical and radiological scores.ResultsThe patients' average age was 44 years (range from 18 to 76). The male gender was predominant (104 males and 53 females).Road traffic accidents were the most common aetiology with over two thirds of the cases. The fractures were type Schatzker II in 61% of the cases. The mean follow-up was five years.Although the clinical and radiological Rasmussen scores were better in group A (internal fixation with lag screws), those differences were statistically insignificant (p = 0.6 and p = 0.8). Group A clinical and radiological scores were 26.06 and 16.57, respectively and those of group B were 25.72 and 16.45.We noticed more sepsis and skin complications and a longer operating time (95 min versus 70 min) in group B patients with a statistically significant difference.None of the patients of our series had bone grafting.ConclusionFor Schatzker II and III fractures, an internal fixation with lag screws would be preferable when possible especially in the case of a pure depression fracture. It yields satisfactory results with a shorter operating time and less complication rate.

This study compared different augmentation methods biomechanically. Materials and Methods: In nine paired fresh-frozen cadaver legs, an identical supination-external rotation type II ankle fracture was created. Fractures were stabilized using an eight-hole locking plate. In four pairs, two screws were inserted across the syndesmosis for purchase in the tibial metaphysis. One leg from each pair was randomly selected for injection of calcium sulphate-calcium phosphate graft into the screw holes. Each leg was mounted to an NITS machine in a custom loading frame. Axial cyclic loading to body weight was performed to measure displacement at the fracture site, followed by rotational loading to failure simulating a supination external rotation injury. Data were analyzed using a two-way paired t-test and ANOVA. Results: The specimens used had a mean bone mineral density of 0.49 +/- 0.15 (SD) g/cm(2), and a mean age of 83 +/- 12 years. In the biomechanical tests, there were no significant differences between augmented and non-augmented locking plates without the tibia-pro-fibula screws in axial stiffness (p = 0.10), external rotation angle at failure (p = 0.42), failure torque (p = 0.57), energy absorbed before failure (p = 0.47), and motion at the fracture site with cyclic axial loading (p = 0.15). There were no significant differences between augmented and non-augmented locking plates with the tibia-pro-fibula screws in the external rotation angle at failure (p = 0.83), failure torque (p = 0.58), and failure energy (p = 0.4). However, the overall strength of the fixation tended to increase with tibia-pro-fibula screws and augmentation. Conclusion: Internal fixation of an osteoporotic lateral malleolar fracture using a locking plate and screws provided a construct comparable in strength to that augmented with calcium sulfate-calcium phosphate graft and/or tibia-pro-fibula screws. Clinical Relevance: Strategies to augment internal fixation of osteoporotic ankle fractures may minimize risk for failure of fixation and may enable early weight bearing mobilization and return to function in elderly patients.

Materials and methods From 2010 to 2019, 51 patients aged from 18 to 87 years were evaluated; 11 patients were excluded from this study. Demographic data, fracture classification, and complications were analyzed. Besides plain radiographs and CT, uptake ratios using bone scintigraphy and/or SPECT were also collected and analyzed. Results At a mean follow-up of 4.4 +/- 2.0 years (range, 2-10 years), the mean Harris hip score was 88, with 44 patients (86.3%) achieving excellent or good outcomes. The rate of complication was 13.7% (7/51), with five cases of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (OFNH). Hip replacements were performed in four (7.8%) cases. After confirmation of normal transfusion status, 11 patients underwent elective removal of the implant without further complications. Conclusion Closed reduction and internal fixation using PCCP in FNFs resulted in satisfactory outcomes with low complication rates. Longer follow-up (3-5 years) and sequential bone scintigraphy or SPECT after surgery are recommended after internal fixation using PCCP.

The treatment of Gustilo IIIB open forearm fractures remains a challenging problem, with a high morbidity rate such as infection, nonunion, even amputation. External fixation is preferred for open lower limb fractures. However, there are significant differences between open bone injuries of the upper and lower extremity in terms of treatment plans. Use of internal fixation methods for open fractures is a controversial issue, as it requires early coverage of skin and soft tissue defects after radical debridement and irrigation. The optimal approach for open forearm fractures remains to be determined. The present study evaluated whether early internal fixation combined with free flap placement is effective for the treatment of Gustilo IIIB open forearm fracture.Hypothesis: Early internal fixation combined with the free flap technique in the treatment of Gustilo IIIB open forearm fracture provides good consolidation results.Material and methods: From January 2015 to January 2020, 20 patients with Gustilo IIIB open forearm fracture treated with early internal fixation combined with free skin flap placement were retrospectively analyzed. There were 9 males and 11 females, with an average age of 40 years. In all cases, the injuries were classified as Gustilo type IIIB. The area of the wounds ranged from 9 x 3 cm to 27 x 10 cm. Fist-stage plate fixation was adopted in 16 cases. Four patients presenting with major contamination received first-stage fixation with Kirschner wires and external fixation, and the second-stage surgery of surgical treatment included flap placement and internal fixation within 10 days. The rates of limb salvage and complications were recorded. The Anderson scoring system was utilized to assess limb function. Results: Limb salvage was successful in all 20 cases. The average length of hospital was 19 days (range, 7-28 days). Four patients developed superficial infections. After debridement, the wounds were covered with skin grafts. No deep infections or osteomyelitis occurred. Three patients developed nonunion, and bone grafts achieved bone healing later. The donor skin flaps healed well, with partial pigmentation. No complete necrosis of the flaps occurred. Only the distal part of flaps became necrotic in two cases, which were then successfully treated by debridement and skin grafting. The average follow-up duration was 14.7 months (range, 8-24 months). According to the Anderson scoring system, 7 cases were graded as excellent, 6 cases as good, 5 cases as fair, and 2 cases as poor. Conclusion: For Gustilo IIIB type injuries, early and thorough debridement along with early internal fixation and skin flap coverage of the wound can achieve satisfactory clinical results, shorten the treatment cycle, and maximize limb function recovery.

Tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis: A biomechanical comparision of multiplanar external fixation with intramedullary fixation	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							ANKLE ARTHRODESIS; SCREW FIXATION; NAIL; STABILITY; DEFORMITY; FUSION	Methods of achieving tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis include intramedullary nailing, crossed lag screws, blade plates, and external fixation. While reports in the orthopaedic literature have compared the biomechanical properties of some of these fixation techniques, to our knowledge none has evaluated multiplanar external fixation. The purpose of this study was to compare the biomechanical properties of intramedullary nail fixation and external ring fixation for fibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis. Materials and Methods: Tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis was performed on ten matched pairs of fresh-frozen human cadaveric legs. A ring fixator stabilized the arthrodesis in one leg from each pair and a 10 mm x 150 mm nail inserted retrograde across the subtalar and ankle joint stabilized the arthrodesis in the contralateral leg. The bending stiffness of the resulting constructs was quantified in plantarflexion, dorsiflexion, inversion, and eversion, and torsional stiffness was measured in internal and external rotation. Results: No difference in bending stiffness between the two constructs was identifiable in any of the four bending directions (p > 0.05). Torsional stiffness was approximately two-fold greater in both internal and external rotation in specimens with the ring fixator arthrodesis than in those with the intramedullary nail (p = 0.002). Conclusion: The ring fixator provides a stiffer construct than a 10 mm x 150 mm intramedullary nail in torsion, but no difference in bending stiffness was demonstrable. Both techniques can provide satisfactory fixation; however, the ring fixator may better minimize rotational joint motion. Clinical Relevance: This study provides a basis for selecting an arthrodesis method that offers optimized fixation.

Surgical treatment of complex distal humeral fractures: Functional outcome after internal fixation using precontoured anatomic plates	JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY			English	Article						Anatomic; distal humerus; fracture; Mayo elbow; internal fixation; parallel plate	BIOMECHANICAL EVALUATION; INTERCONDYLAR FRACTURES; ELBOW FUNCTION; GRIP STRENGTH; ADULTS; MANAGEMENT; STABILITY; TRAUMA	Hypothesis: Several studies have shown good results with internal fixation of distal humeral fractures; however, few have focused specifically on anatomic parallel plate fixation using the same implant and postoperative regimen. The purpose of this study was to determine the functional outcome after open reduction and internal fixation of these complex fractures using parallel precontoured anatomic plates. Materials and methods: This was a retrospective single-surgeon series involving 16 patients (12 women, 4 men) treated with a double-column parallel plating technique. Clinical assessment included the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Score (DASH). Mean age was 43 years (range, 20-78 years). Average follow-up was 35 months. Four fractures were AO type A and 12 were AO type C. Results: Union was achieved in all patients. There was no superficial or deep infection or hardware failure. Two patients required removal of plates for pain and prominence but not all screws could be completely removed. The mean flexion was 132 degrees and extension was 29 degrees. The mean DASH score was 46.1. Grip strength was 56% of the uninjured side. Mean flexion and extension force was 72% and 70%, respectively, of the uninjured elbow. The mean MEPS score was 72.3. Discussion: Anatomically precontoured parallel plates are effective in achieving bony union with low implant failure with acceptable functional outcomes. However, screw extraction can be difficult when the implant is removed.

Methods Computerized databases were searched for RCTs published between 1966 and 2004. 14 RCTs containing 2,289 patients were included in a metaanalysis regarding complications, reoperations and mortality. The analysis was performed with software from the Cochrane collaboration. Results Primary arthroplasty leads to significantly fewer major method-related hip complications and reoperations, compared to internal fixation. There was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups at 30 days and 1 year. Most of the studies found better function and less pain after primary arthroplasty. Interpretation Primary arthroplasty should be used in most patients with displaced femoral neck fracture. The healthy, lucid individual, 70-80 years old, should be given a total hip arthroplasty. The older, impaired or institutionalized patient would benefit from a hemiarthroplasty.

Comparative Evaluation of Clinical Outcomes Using Delta Plates and Conventional Miniplates for Internal Fixation of Mandibular Condylar Fractures in Adults	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							SUBCONDYLAR FRACTURES; NECK FRACTURES; CLOSED TREATMENT; OPEN REDUCTION; BIOMECHANICAL EVALUATION; TRANSPAROTID APPROACH; INTRAORAL APPROACH; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; RIGID FIXATION; LAG SCREWS	Purpose: In recent years numerous osteosynthesis devices have become available for the management of condylar fractures. The aim of this study was to compare and evaluate the clinical outcomes of delta plates and conventional miniplates for internal fixation of mandibular condylar fractures in adults. Materials and Methods: We performed a prospective study of 20 patients with subcondylar fractures requiring open reduction and internal fixation for their management. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups using computer software: Group A patients (n = 10) were treated using delta plates whereas group B patients (n = 10) were treated using conventional miniplates via an extraoral retromandibular transparotid approach. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between delta plates and conventional miniplates for internal fixation of mandibular condylar fractures in adults. However, the time taken for adaptation of the delta plates was significantly lower than that required for the 2 miniplates (P <.001), and the ease of adaptation was significantly better for the delta plates (P <.001). Conclusions: The study results indicated that the delta plate and miniplate are equally effective in terms of long-term clinical success in the management of mandibular subcondylar fractures in adults. The delta plate is superior in terms of handling characteristics, such as ease of adaptation and time required for adaptation, as only 1 plate and 4 screws are required as compared with 2 plates and 8 screws.

Management, however, is poorly codified and there is no clear decision-tree.Hypothesis: Analyzing our experience over the last 15 years could enable a reproducible strategy to be drawn up, with a decision-tree based on the 2 main causes: failure of internal fixation, and infection.Material and method: Sixty-one patients were included in a retrospective cohort, with a mean 94 months' follow-p. The treatment strategy was based on screening first for infection then for mechanical stability deficit in case of prior internal fixation. Any fixation revision was associated to cancellous autograft. In case of suspected or proven infection, 2-stage treatment was implemented. In case of primary non -operative treatment, the strategy was based on the non-union risk on the Non-Union Scoring System (NUSS), with internal fixation and possible graft.Results: There were 6 failures, for a consolidation rate of 90%; excluding patients not managed according to the study protocol, the consolidation rate was 95%. There was 1 case of spontaneously resolving postoperative radial palsy, and 3 patients required surgical revision.Discussion: The present strategy achieved consolidation in most cases, providing the surgeon with a decision-tree for these patients. Infectious etiologies are often overlooked and should be a focus of screening. Level of evidence: IV, retrospective or historical series.& COPY; 2022 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Materials and Methods: A single-center, prospective clinical cohort study of 26 lesions in 23 consecutive patients with painful osteolytic skeletal lesions was performed. Patients were followed for an average of 7 mo (1-18 mo). Lesions were targeted from the most intact bone via minimally invasive percutaneous approach fin stable anchorage of internal fixation screws using fluoroscopic guidance. Cannulated screws served as universal portals for ablation, balloon osteoplasty, and delivery of hone cement in addition to internal fixation for cement anchoring and prophylactic stabilization of uninvolved bone. Results: There were 19 osteolytic lesions in the pelvis, 4 in the proximal femur. 2 in the proximal tibia, and I in the calcaneus. All defects were associated with severe pain or fractures. There were no conversions to open surgery and no infection or bleeding requiring transfusion, embolization, or additional procedures. There was significant improvement in visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score from 8.32 +/- 1.70 to 2.36 +/- 2.23, combined pain and functional ambulation score from 4.48 +/- 2.84 to 7.28 +/- 2.76, and Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score from 45% to 68% (P < .05). Conclusions: Ablation, osteoplasty, reinforcement, and internal fixation is a safe and effective minimally invasive percutaneous image-guided treatment option for functional improvement or palliation of painful osteolytic lesions in the pelvis and periarticular loadhearing hones.

Our study is focused on the development of a new Fe-Mn-Cu alloy with enhanced antimicrobial properties. In this work, Fe-Mn-Cu alloys, with up to 10 wt% copper (Cu), were prepared by powder metallurgy route. Degradation behaviour of the alloys were studied using potentiodynamic polarization test which showed nearly about 6 times increase in corrosion rate for 10 wt% Cu compared to the base alloy. Addition of Cu has significantly increased microhardness for up to 5 wt% and decreased thereafter. Broth micro-dilution test showed increased antimicrobial activity with Cu addition in Fe-Mn alloy while in vitro cytocompatibility study showed more than 70% cell viability for all alloys. Present study indicates that Cu alloying in Fe-Mn makes it a suitable material for internal fracture fixation devices with enhanced antimicrobial properties. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Materials and Methods: Twenty-one isolated capitellum fractures that were surgically treated were included in the study. Fixation was achieved with two headless cannulated compression screws placed in anteroposterior and posteroanterior order using the modified lateral elbow approach. The Broberg-Morrey rating system was used to assess the post-operative functional status of the patients. Results: According to the Broberg-Morrey criteria, the mean score was 92.7 (77-100) and 13 cases had excellent, 7 had good, and 1 had fair results. None of the patients developed avascular necrosis or heterotopic ossification. According to the Broberg-Morrey arthrosis score, two cases had Grade 1 and one had Grade 2 arthrosis. One patient had a superficial wound site infection that was treated with antibiotics, and in one case a 60 degrees extension loss was observed in the elbow. Conclusion: Treatment of isolated capitellar fractures with 2 headless screws placed anteroposteriorly and posteroanteriorly can provide stable fixation and is less traumatic for the elbow joint.

Materials and Methods: Mandibular linear fractures were created artificially in dogs and fixed using a bulge core type system or a miniplate system in vitro. A 3-point load cell was used to contrast the fixation strength of the 2 systems in vitro. Histologic sections were used to analyze the healing of mandibular linear fractures and to contrast the efficiency of fixation of the 2 systems in vivo. Tetracycline-fluorescein staining technology was used to evaluate the bone healing speed in the mandibular fracture lines during bone healing. Results: In vitro, the 3-point load cell showed that the fixation strength of the bulge core type system was greater than that of the miniplate system (P < .05). In vivo, the histologic sections and tetracycline-fluorescein staining showed that greater and quicker bony healing occurred using the bulge core type system (P < .05) and that the efficiency of fixation of the 2 systems was similar. Conclusion: Our results have shown that the bulge core type system can provide sufficient strength for mandibular linear fracture healing.

The aim of this study is to determine whether the timing of the conversion influences the development of deep infection and fracture healing in a cohort of patients treated by DCO after a closed fracture of the lower limb. Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate whether the one-stage conversion procedure is always safe. Materials and methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single level 1 trauma centre. Ninety-four cases of closed fractures of lower limb treated by DCO subsequently converted to internal fixation from 2012 to 2019 were included. Development of deep infection, superficial infection, non-union and time to union were recorded. Patients were then divided into three groups according to the timing of conversion: Group A (<7 days), Group B (7-13 days), Group C (> 14 days). Comparison between groups was performed to assess intergroup variabilty. Results: The mean number of days between DCO and conversion was 6.7 +/- 4.52 (range 1-22). We observed one case of deep infection (1.1%), one case of non-union (1.1%), four cases of superficial infection (4.3%) and mean time to union was 4.9 +/- 1.38 months months. Comparison between groups demonstrated no significant correlation between timing of conversion and development of superficial or deep infection and non-union, while it highlighted that complexity of the fracture and longer surgical time of conversion procedure were significantly higher in Group C. Conclusions: One-stage conversion to definitive internal fixation within 22 days from DCO is a safe and feasible procedure, which does not influence the incidence of infection or non-union.

Evaluating Internal Fixation Skills Using Surgical Simulation	JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME			English	Article							ORTHOPEDIC-SURGERY; LEARNING-CURVE	Background: Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) is an essential skill for an orthopaedic surgeon, yet teaching its components to surgical residents poses challenges in both complexity and cost. Surgical simulation has demonstrated efficacy and is now a mandated component of residency programs, but the techniques and resources required for effective simulation vary greatly. We hypothesized that simulation of ORIF skills could be accomplished in a costeffective, quantifiable, and reproducible manner and that this experience coupled with didactic learning would increase skill proficiency and enhance ORIF performance. Methods: Sixteen postgraduate-year-1 orthopaedic surgery interns were assessed on performance of ORIF simulation tasks before and after attending a module designed to introduce and practice internal fixation techniques. Simulation tasks addressed drilling accuracy via oblique drilling through polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cylinders and bisecting wooden dowels and plunge control via drilling through layered boards of varying densities. Fracture fixation simulation involved fixing oblique fractures on synthetic ulnae. Task performance was assessed at 3 time points: immediately before the module, 1 week after the module, and 3 months after the module. Fracture fixation was assessed before and after the module via load-to-failure testing. Success rates for the tasks were analyzed using a repeated-measures analysis of variance, and mechanical properties of the fixed ulnar constructs were compared using paired t tests. Results: In all ORIF simulation tasks, pre-module to post-module improvement in success rates was significant (p < 0.001) and improvements were maintained between the post-module assessment and the 3-month follow-up. The interns also achieved significantly greater strengths in their ulnar fixation constructs, with a mean improvement of 256 N (p = 0.01) after the module. Conclusions: These results indicate that the technical and sensorimotor skills relevant to internal fixation (with emphasis on the specific skill of using a drill) can be significantly augmented and retained in the short term in surgical residents after exposure to faculty-led lecture and hands-on skills practice using low-cost materials.

The best treatment is still subject to debate. The aim of this study was to assess the medium-to-long-term clinical and functional outcome of ankle fractures with a PM fragment in a larger patient population. Materials and methods One hundred patients (69 women, 31 men, average age 60 years) with ankle fractures including the PM were evaluated clinically and radiographically. Patients with Bartonicek-Rammelt type 3 and 4 fracture displayed a significant female preponderance. Fixation of the PM was performed in 63% and tailored to the individual fracture pattern. Results Internal fixation of the PM fragment was negatively correlated with the need for syndesmotic screw placement at the time of surgery (p = 0.010). At an average follow-up of 7.0 years, the mean Foot Function Index (FFI) was 16.5 (SD: 21.5), the Olerud Molander Ankle Score (OMAS) averaged 80.2 (SD: 24) and the American Orthopedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle/hindfoot score averaged 87.5 (SD: 19.1). The maximum score of 100 was achieved by 44% of patients. The physical (PCS) and mental health component summary (MCS) scores of the SF-36 averaged 47.7 (SD: 12.51) and 50.5 (SD: 9.36), respectively. Range of motion was within 3.4 (SD: 6.63) degrees of the uninjured side. The size of the PM fragment had no prognostic value. There was a trend to lower outcome scores with slight anterior or posterior shift of the distal fibula within the tibial incisura. Patients who underwent primary internal fixation had significantly superior SF-36 MCS than patients who underwent staged internal fixation (p = 0.031). Conclusions With an individualized treatment protocol, tailored to the CT-based assessment of PM fractures, favorable medium and long-term results can be expected.

Internal fixation and muscle pedicle bone grafting in femoral neck fractures	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Femoral neck fracture; open reduction; internal fixation; muscle pedicle bone grafting; quadratus femoris muscle pedicle bone grafting		Background: The treatment of displaced intracapsular femoral neck fracture is still an unsolved problem. Non-union and avascular necrosis are the two main complications of this fracture, especially if patient presents late. Muscle pedicle bone grafting has been advocated to provide additional blood supply. We present analysis of our 32 cases of displaced femoral neck fracture treated by internal fixation and quadratus femoris based muscle pedicle bone grafting. Materials and Methods: Open reduction and internal fixation with muscle pedicle grafting was done in 32 patients. The age of patients varied from 14-62 years (average age 45 years) with male to female ratio of 13:3. Twenty-nine fractures were more than three weeks old. All the cases were treated by Meyers procedure. The fracture was internally fixed after open reduction and then a muscle pedicle graft was applied. It was supplemented by cancellous bone graft in seven cases. Fixation was done by parallel cancellous lag screws ( n = 19), crossed Gardens screws ( n = 7), parallel Asnis screws ( n = 5) and Moores pin ( n = 1).Quadratus femoris muscle pedicle graft was used in 32 cases. In the initial 12 cases the graft was fixed with circumferential proline sutures, but later, to provide a secure fixation, the graft was fixed with a cancellous screw ( n = 20). Postoperative full weight bearing was deferred to an average of 10 weeks. Results: Union was achieved in 26/29 (89.65) cases which could be followed for an average period of 3.4 years, (2-8.5 years) with good functional results and had the ability to squat and sit cross-legged. Results were based on hip rating system given by Salvatti and Wilson. The results were excellent in 15 cases, good in four cases, fair in four cases and poor in six cases. Complications were avascular necrosis ( n = 2), transient foot drop ( n = 2), coxa-vara ( n = 1) and temporary loss of scrotal sensation ( n = 1). Conclusion: Muscle pedicle bone grafting with internal fixation is a viable treatment option in displaced femoral neck fractures with late presentation.	[Gupta, A.

External Ring Fixation Versus Screw Fixation for Ankle Arthrodesis: A Biomechanical Comparison	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Arthrodesis; Fixator; Ankle; Screws	COMPRESSION ARTHRODESIS; MECHANICAL PERFORMANCE; FIXATORS; FUSION; FRAME; NAIL	Background: The use of external ring fixation for ankle arthrodesis offers an alternative to internal screw fixation when bone quality is suboptimal, when complex ankle pathology is present, and as a salvage procedure for complicated cases. Additionally, it permits earlier weightbearing and postoperative adjustment of bone alignment and joint compression. This study was designed to determine whether there are differences in initial ankle joint fixation integrity between these two techniques. Materials and Methods: Ten fresh-frozen cadaveric lower extremities underwent ankle arthrodesis with a hybrid ring fixator, and the bending and torsional stiffness of each arthrodesed joint was quantified. Stiffness was calculated from angulation measured at the tibiotalar joint using electronic clinometers attached to those bones. The external fixators were then removed and ankle arthrodesis performed using 6.5-mm cannulated screws: three across the ankle joint, one fixing the fibula to the tibia, and one fixing the fibula to the talus. Stiffness testing was then repeated. Results: No statistically significant difference in bending stiffness, torsional stiffness, or joint rotation under torsional load was demonstrable between the two techniques. Conclusion: The similarity in ankle fusion site stability achieved with external ring fixation and an optimized screw fixation technique under the described testing conditions indicates that, in cases in which suboptimal bone quality or complex ankle pathology preclude the use of internal fixation, an external fixator is a viable option. Clinical Relevance: Establishing that the primary stability of external ring fixation is comparable to that of screw fixation provides a basis for its use in cases in which screw fixation may be problematic.

Material and Methods: In the period from November 2003 to January 2008, the authors treated 33 patients with 34 fractures of the proximal humerus. The mean age was 57 years old (33 to 86 years), 14 males and 19 females. All patients were operated in the acute phase, within the first week after the trauma. The patients were treated with open reduction and internal fixation using locking plates. The surgical technique, implants, period of immobilization and rehabilitation protocol were the same for all the patients. Results: The mean follow-up period was 24 months (8 to 60 months). The functional evaluation was based in the UCLA score. Good and excellent results were present in 31 (91.2%) of the patients and 3 (8.8%) of them presented poor results. Conclusions: As a conclusion, the locking plate system of fixation was considered efficient for the treatment of proximal humerus fractures.

Three-dimensional (3D) printing of an acetabular wing-plate is a new minimally invasive surgical technique for complex acetabular fractures. Objectives. To investigate the biomechanical stability of 3D printing acetabular wing-plates. The results were compared with 2 conventional fixation systems. Material and methods. Eighteen fresh frozen cadaveric pelvises with both column fractures were randomly divided to 3 groups: A - iliosciatic plates fixation system; B- 3D printing plates; C- 2 parallel reconstruction plates fixation system. These constructions were loaded onto a biomechanical testing machine. Longitudinal displacement and stiffness values of the constructs were measured to estimate their stability. Results. When the load force reached 700 N, Group A was superior to Group B in the longitudinal displacement of point 1 (p > 0.05). The longitudinal displacement of point 2 showed no significant differences among Groups A, B and C, and the displacement of the fracture line over point 3 showed no significant differences between Groups A and B (p > 0.05). The axial stiffness of Groups A, B and C were 122.4800 +/- 8.8480 N/mm, 168.4830 +/- 14.8091 N/mm and 83.1300 +/- 3.8091 N/mm, respectively. Group B was significantly stiffer than A and C (p < 0.05). Loads at failure of internal fixation were 1378.83 +/- 34.383 N, 1516.83 +/- 30.896 N and 1351.00 +/- 26.046 N for Groups A, B and C, respectively. Group B was significantly superior to Groups A and C (p > 0.05). Conclusions. Customized 3D printing acetabular-wing plates provide stability for acetabular fractures compared to intraspecific buttressing fixation.

Thirty synthetic hemimandibles, which had all undergone a 5-mm advancement, were divided into three groups: three 12-mm bicortical titanium screws were placed in an inverted L pattern in group A; one straight 2.0-mm system spaced titanium plate fixed with four 5-mm monocortical screws was used in group B; two 1.5-mm system L-shaped titanium plates, each fixed with four 5-mm monocortical screws, were used in group C. The models were subjected to compressive and progressive mechanical tests with forces applied in the area between the second premolar and first molar to verify resistance in Newtons (N). A displacement speed of 1 mm/min was applied, with a maximum 10 mm displacement of the distal segment or until disruption of the fixation. The deformity and/or eventual rupture of the plates were evaluated, and consequently their technical stability was determined. The results showed that the modified fixation technique tested in this study on synthetic mandibles resulted in adequate stability and superior mechanical behaviour compared to simulated osteosynthesis with the use of a straight 2.0-mm titanium plate.

Between January 2000 and January 2009 225 patients were surgically treated for a mandibular fracture (mean age of 32.6 (SD +/- 14.6) years). A total of 426 fracture lines were identified. Of 213 dentate patients 29 patients were treated primarily with intermaxillary fixation (IMF). IMF combined with osteosynthesis was performed on 99 patients. Seventy-nine patients received IMF only per-operatively to make open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) possible. Of 12 edentulous patients three patients were treated with Gunning splints. Nine patients were treated by manual reduction and internal fixation. A total of 1965 screws and 442 plates were used. Sixty (26.7%) patients presented with complications, including (transient) hyposensibility of the lip and chin (34 patients), dysocclusion (15 patients), infected osteosynthesis material (six patients) and temporomandibular dysfunction (five patients). Four patients needed surgical retreatment for correction of a dysocclusion. The results of this report are partly in line with other studies and provide important data for improving the treatment of the fractured mandible.

In a long-term experimental study, we have determined the patterns of tissue restoration 36 and 54 months after implantation of polyglycolic acid and poly-laevo-lactic acid screws in the distal femur of the rabbit. After 36 months in the polyglycolic acid group the specimens showed no remaining polymer and loose connective tissue occupied 80% of the screw track. Tissue restoration remained poor at 54 months, the amounts of trabecular bone and haematopoietic elements being significantly lower than those in the intact control group. The amount of trabecular bone within the screw track at 54 months in the polyglycolic acid group was less than in the empty drill holes (p = 0.04). In the poly-laevo-lactic acid group, polymeric material was present in abundance after 54 months, occupying 60% of the cross-section of the core area of the screw track. When using absorbable internal fixation implants we should recognise that the degradation of the devices will probably not be accompanied by the restoration of normal trabecular bone.

However, external fixation can cause nail tract infections and is ineffective for fixing small fracture fragments. Moreover, closed reduction and internal fixation during the early stage of injury can lead to potential bone infection, conducive to bone nonunion and delayed healing. Herein, we designed a bone adhesive with anti-infection, osteogenic and bone adhesion fixation properties to promote reduction and fixation of open fractures and subsequent soft tissue repair. It was prepared by the reaction of gelatin (Gel) and oxidized starch (OS) with vancomycin (VAN)-loaded mesoporous bioactive glass nanoparticles (MBGNs) covalently cross-linked with Schiff bases. Characterization and adhesion experiments were conducted to validate the successful preparation of the Gel-OS/VAN@MBGNs (GOVM-gel) adhesive. Meanwhile, in vitro cell experiments demonstrated its good antibacterial effects with the ability to stimulate bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSCs) proliferation, upregulate the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteogenic proteins (RunX2 and OPN) and enhance the deposition of calcium nodules. Additionally, we established a rat skull fracture model and a subcutaneous infection model. The histological analysis showed that bone adhesive enhanced osteogenesis, and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the number of inflammatory cells and bacteria was significantly reduced. Overall, the adhesive could promote early reduction of fractures and antibacterial and osteogenic effects, providing the foothold for treatment of this patient population.

The purpose of this study was to propose a novel "double-point fixation" for calcaneal fractures and compare its biomechanical stability with the traditional "three-point fixation." A three-dimensional finite element foot model with a Sanders type IIIAB calcaneal fracture was developed based on clinical images comprising bones, plantar fascia, ligaments, and encapsulated soft tissue. Double-point and three-point fixation resembled the surgical procedure with a volar distal radius plate and calcaneal locking plate, respectively. The stress distribution, fracture displacement, and change of the Bohler angle and Gissane's angle were estimated by a walking simulation using the model, and the predictions between the double-point and three-point fixation were compared at heel-strike, midstance, and push-off instants. Double-point fixation demonstrated lower bone stress (103.3 vs. 199.4 MPa), but higher implant stress (1,084.0 vs. 577.9 MPa). The model displacement of double-point fixation was higher than that of three-point fixation (3.68 vs. 2.53 mm). The displacement of the posterior joint facet (0.127 vs. 0.150 mm) and the changes of the Bohler angle (0.9 degrees vs. 1.4 degrees) and Gissane's angle (0.7 degrees vs. 0.9 degrees) in double-point fixation were comparably lower. Double-point fixation by volar distal radius plates demonstrated sufficient and favorable fixation stability and a lower risk of postoperative stress fracture, which may potentially serve as a new fixation modality for the treatment of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures.

There are few papers in the literature that comment on the management of these fractures. Materials and Methods: We reviewed four cases of fractures of the sustentaculum talus of the calcaneus treated with open reduction and internal fixation from one surgeon's 15-year practice. Results: This is a case report that describes the presentation, management and outcome of these four cases. Conclusions: In this small series of cases, operative treatment appears to have been appropriate. Direct anatomic approach with accurate open reduction and internal fixation has been relatively successful in these patients.

The associations between time to fixation and target outcomes (pulmonary embolism [PE], deep vein thrombosis [DVT], acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS], and mortality) were assessed. Maximization of the sum of sensitivity and specificity was used to determine the optimal cut point. The patients were divided into three groups according to different time to fixation intervals. A multinomial propensity scores weighting using generalized boosted models was performed for all unbiased pre-treatment factors between the groups. Multivariate logistic regression was used to clarify the outcomes predictors.Results: The univariate and multivariate analysis before weighting showed that only PE was significantly associated with time to fixation (odds ratio [OR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.09; p = 0.012). The optimal cut point of time to fixation was 13.88 h. The patients were divided into accelerated (<= 13.88 h), standard (> 13.88 and <= 24 h), and delayed (> 24 and < 36 h) groups. After weighting for all unbiased pretreatment factors between the groups, multivariate logistic regression showed that standard group significantly increased the risk of PE compared with accelerated group (OR, 4.436; 95% CI, 1.844-10.672; p = 0.001).Conclusion: Accelerated intramedullary internal fixation within 13.88 h was associated with a significantly decreased risk of PE compared with standard fixation in patients with isolated and unilateral femoral shaft fractures without additional mortality risks.

Materials and methods: A scaphoid nonunion model was created by removing a volar wedge of bone from the waist of the scaphoid in 18 fresh frozen human cadavers. Cancellous sawbone graft was inserted into the osteotomy site and three groups of six cadavers were randomized for internal fixation with a pair of parallel, 0.045-inch K-wires, a Mini Acutrak screw, or a Standard Acutrak screw, respectively. The potted specimens were tested using an Instron Tensile Testing machine by applying force to the distal pole of the scaphoid. The load and stiffness were calculated at 2-mm and 4-mm displacements. Results: Both the Mini and Standard Acutrak screws were statistically stronger and stiffer at 2-mm displacement than the pair of parallel K-wires. No statistically significant difference was noted between the Standard and Mini screws at 2-mm displacement. At higher loads (4-mm displacement), the Standard Acutrak screw exhibited significantly greater strength and stiffness than the Mini Acutrak screw. Conclusion: Due to increased strength of fixation and stiffness, and with an additional advantage of interfragmentary compression, the Standard Acutrak screw followed by the Mini Acutrak screw may be a better option than a pair of parallel K-wires in the treatment of scaphoid nonunions.

The authors here report their clinical experience using OSTEOTRANS MX.Methods:The authors treated 35 patients (19 men, 16 women; age, 14-88 years; meanstandard deviation, 38.419.9 years) with maxillofacial fractures. The authors used standard surgery to stabilize fractures in all patients, fitting resorbable plates (thickness, 1.0 or 1.4mm) and screws (diameter, 2mm) according to Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen/Association (AO) for the Study of Internal Fixation guidelines.Results:All patients eventually achieved satisfactory healing with favorable restoration of form and function without foreign body reaction. Complications occurred in 3 patientsplate exposure in 2 and discomfort in 1. However, fracture sites healed in all patients. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the devices bonded directly to the bone without interposition of nonmineralized tissue.Conclusion:OSTEOTRANS MX is a useful material with few complications. Its osteoconductive bioactivity is advantageous for the early functional improvement of maxillofacial fractures.

J	Park, YH; Cho, HW; Choi, JW; Kim, HJ				Park, Young Hwan; Cho, Hyun Woo; Choi, Jung Woo; Kim, Hak Jun			Comparison between headless compression screws and tension band wires for the fixation of medial malleolar fractures: a prospective randomized trial	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Ankle fractures; Fracture fixation; Internal fixators; Trauma	ANKLE FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; OUTCOMES; EPIDEMIOLOGY; REMOVAL; SCALE; PAIN	Introduction To date, there has been no prospective randomized trial supporting the rationale of the use of headless compression screw (HCS) compared to conventional fixation methods for medial malleolar fractures. This study aimed to prospectively compare the outcomes of the HCS and tension band wire (TBW) for the fixation of medial malleolar fractures. Material and methods Sixty patients were randomized to receive either an HCS or a TBW for the fixation of a medial malleolar fracture. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Olerud-Molander ankle score (OMAS), EuroQoL five-dimensional instrument (EQ-5D) score, visual analog scale (VAS) score, patient satisfaction with implant-related symptoms, operative time, and incision length. Radiographic outcomes were assessed using the presence of nonunion, delayed union, and articular incongruity. Clinical and radiographic assessments were performed at 2 and 6 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Results The OMAS, EQ-5D score, VAS score, and operative time did not differ between the HCS and TBW groups; however, the HCS group had greater satisfaction with implant-related symptoms and smaller incision than the TBW group. There was no difference in the presence of nonunion, delayed union, and articular incongruity. Conclusion HCS fixation for medial malleolar fractures is not inferior to TBW fixation, while reducing implant-related symptoms. These findings suggest that HCS is a viable alternative for the fixation of medial malleolar fractures.

Comparison of plain radiography and CT in postoperative evaluation of ankle fractures	CLINICAL RADIOLOGY			English	Article							COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; REDUCTION; IMPLANTS; REMOVAL	AIM: To compare postoperative plain radiographs with computed tomography (CT) post-processing images in evaluating the quality of anatomical reduction and internal fixation of ankle fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 168 patients who sustained closed ankle fracture and were treated with open reduction and internal fixation in East Hospital were reviewed. Postoperative plain radiographs and CT post-processing images were evaluated. The observation was performed under volume-rendering mode and multiplanar reconstruction mode. The assessment was performed by two independent orthopaedic surgeons. The inter-and intra-observer variations were analysed by kappa statistics. The differences between plain radiographs and CT post-processing images were compared using chi(2) test (McNemar's test). RESULTS: Inter- and intra-observer agreement was almost perfect (0.813-1.000) using CT post-processing images, which was higher than that using plain radiographs (0.323-0.848). More non-anatomical reduction could be recognised in the supination-external rotation (SER), supination-adduction (SAD), pronation-external rotation (PER), and overall groups (p<0.05) and more poor internal fixation could be recognised in the SER, SAD, and overall groups (p<0.05) using CT post-processing images than using radiographs. CONCLUSION: More residual articular step, fracture fragment displacement, and poor internal fixation could be detected by CT post-processing images than plain radiographs.

Volar plate fixation is not always considered the gold standard treatment. Objective: To measure the resistance of a fragment-specific fixation assembly model obtained by plate fixation associated with different K-wire sizes. Method: In this original experimental study, novel II, axial compression of bone materials was tested. Results: In both groups, the maximum force supported by the fixation method in our study was ten times greater than the physiological load to which the wrist was subjected under physiological conditions. Discussion: In this study, we obtained encouraging results when compared to results reported in the literature. Our study showed that our bone fixating system was mechanically adequate for articular fractures of the intermediate column of the radius (Melone classification). The results were similar or superior to the results of pressure resistance and stiffness when data from the literature was used as reference. Conclusion: The proposed fixation method demonstrated adequate resistance for fixation of the intermediate column of the distal radius. Increasing K-wire size caused augmented resistance of the fixation.

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of open reduction and internal fixation, minimally invasive percutaneous osteosynthesis, and intramedullary nailing of distal tibial fractures in adults using network meta-analysis of data from clinical trials. Material/Methods: The studies were abstracted from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CNKI, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Randomized controlled trials meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected. Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata software, version 13.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA). Results: Eleven randomized controlled trials were included. The total number of participants was 710 and the studies were published between 2005 and 2017. There were no significant differences in rates of delayed union, nonunion, or malunion among the various treatments (all p>0.05). The intramedullary nailing group had a lower incidence of wound complications than did the open reduction and internal fixation group and minimally invasive percutaneous osteosynthesis technique group. The SUCRA probabilities were 28.6% for ORIF, 98.4% for IMN, and 22.9% for MIPPO. Conclusions: Given the superior results for intramedullary nailing in terms of wound complications, we recommend this procedure for treatment of distal tibial fractures. More RCTs focused on distal tibial fractures are needed to support the current evidence.

Tibial plateau fractures: Internal fixation with locking plates and the MIPO technique	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Tibial plateau; Internal fixation; MIPO; MIPPO; Locking plate; Osteointegration; Functional outcome; Clinical outcome	LESS INVASIVE STABILIZATION; OPEN REDUCTION; MANAGEMENT; 5-YEAR	Proximal tibial fractures are difficult lesions to treat because of the involvement of the articular surface, the often occurring comminution, and the precarious condition of the soft tissues, especially following high-energy trauma. Aim of the treatment is to restore the congruence of the articular surface supporting the tibial plateau cartilage which is usually depressed; to fix the fracture with a stable device; to allow early rehabilitation. We present our treatment strategy, utilising closed or open reduction and internal fixation, angle-stable polyaxial plates, immediate osteointegration, when necessary, with autologous bone graft or other osteoconductive material augmented with autologous platelet gel. Surgery is soft-tissue dependent in terms of timing, and it is usually performed directly or under supervision of an experienced surgeon utilising, whenever possible, a tissue sparing technique. A cohort of 58 proximal tibial fractures, surgically treated, from January 2004 to June 2007, was retrospectively reviewed. Fractures were classified according the OTA/AO classification. The assessment of the functional outcome with the use of the Rasmussen score identified good to excellent results in 78% of the cohort 12 months post-surgery. Internal fixation with locking plates, following the principles of MIPO ( Minimally Invasive Percutaneous Osteosynthesis), provides satisfactory fracture reduction with good results regarding the mid-term clinical outcome.

Fractures occur due to force impact or osteoporosis. Fracture healing is a complicated process. Fracture fixation techniques focus on imparting reduction to fractured fragments and induce healing. When considering possible fixation methods, the aspect of micro-movement is an important one, as this induces callus formation which tends to be a crucial step for fracture healing. Internal fixation of long bone fractures using metallic plates has been carried out since decades and recently advancements have been in synthesizing biodegradable plates as well. The purpose of this research was to fabricate an Auxetic Polymeric Bone Plate that can be used as an internal fixator for long bone fracture; this bone plate renders micro-movement due to its counter intuitive behavior, has the potential to reduce the effect of stress shielding and allow the same range of motion as that of natural bone. METHODS: Polyurethane was chosen as a material for the fabrication of the Auxetic device because of its biocompatibility and non-toxic effects. The plate was then tested for mechanical properties such as Tensile and Compression testing to determine the strength. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The tensile testing of the Auxetic polyurethane specimens showed that the mean of the Poisson's ratio of the samples lies between -0.68 and -0.87 at different uni-axial tensile load values. The Auxetic structure of our device has the potential to allow for efficient fixation because its negative Poisson's ratio offers micro-movement, thereby causing fixation with relative stability rather than absolute stability. The Auxetic bone plate can be superior to contemporary plate fixation systems, as it demands meaningfully small contact points. The suitable mechanical properties might lessen stress shielding effects that are normally caused by rigid bone plates. The Auxetic nature of the bone will help align and sustain the bone fragments with small fracture gaps in order to impart appropriate assembly to accomplish bone healing.

Methods: The clinical materials of 25 cases with multiple fractured ribs caused by blunt chest trauma, including 18 males and 7 females, averagely aging (60.1+/-13.3) years old, were retrospectively analyzed in our hospital from October 2012 to January 2016. They received open reduction and treatment of claw-type rib bone plates fixation under general anesthesia. Additionally, visual analogue score (VAS) was utilized to evaluate the pain. Results: Satisfactory effects were obtained in all patients with fractured ribs using rib bone plates. Postoperative recheck of chest X-rays or chest CT demonstrated favorable reduction without migration or dislocation, meanwhile, bilateral thoraces were roughly symmetrical and thoracic deformity disappeared on affected side compared with that before the surgery. The chest wall was stabilized and patients were satisfied with rectification of chest wall deformity after undergoing rib bone plates fixation; patients' postoperative pain was significantly relieved. All the surgeries were successful and the rib bone plates were taken out from patients, consequently, patients recovered postoperatively without those preoperative symptoms. Conclusions: The efficacy of internal fixation of claw-type rib bone plates on multiple fractured ribs was satisfactory no matter whether patients suffered from flail chest or not, possessing a higher clinical application value.

Material/Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 52 patients with old lower cervical fracture and dislocation treated with anterior partial corpectomy and titanium mesh fusion fixation between January 2008 and December 2013, with a mean follow-up period of 4.1 years. There were 35 males and 17 females. Patient radiological data and clinical parameters were recorded and compared before and after the operations. Results: The average follow-up was 4.1 years. Intervertebral height and physiological curvature were well-reconstructed for all cases. No loosening or rupturing of titanium plate or screw occurred. The neurological function of the patients with incomplete spinal cord injury was significantly improved, and the function of the nerve roots at the injury level was also improved in patients with complete spinal cord injury. Bone fusion was completed within 6 months to 1 year after surgery. Conclusions: Completed decompression, sequence and physiological curvature of the cervical vertebra, immediate and long-term anterior cervical column support, and nerve function restoration can be achieved by using anterior partial corpectomy and titanium mesh fusion and internal fixation to treat old fracture dislocation of the lower cervical spine. For cases with locked facet joints or posterior structures invading the vertebral canal, the combined anterior and posterior approaches should be performed, when necessary, to achieve better results.

Materials and methods: We identified 22 patients (14 men and 8 women) with a mean age of 33.8 years (range, 17-60 years) with bone nonunion and severe bone defects associated with supracondylar or intercondylar humerus fractures, or both. The humeral condyle in each patient was anatomically reconstructed using autologous iliac bone grafts and internal fixation. Active functional exercise was initiated 3 to 4 weeks after surgery. The following variables were assessed: preoperative and postoperative elbow range of motion, Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS), and postoperative complications. Results: Mean follow-up was 38.6 months. Mean duration until bone union was 5.6 months. Preoperatively, 16 patients had a fair or poor MEPS (<75). At final follow-up MEPS was excellent (>90) in 8, good (75-90) in 9, fair (60-74) in 4, and poor (<60) in 1 patient. Postoperative heterotopic ossification anterior to the elbow joint occurred in 2 patients. Conclusions: Our preliminary results suggest that anatomic reconstruction of the humeral condyle using autogenous iliac bone grafting with internal fixation can improve elbow joint function in patients with bone nonunion and bone defects associated with supracondylar or intracondylar humeral fractures, or both. Larger scale studies are warranted to confirm our findings and compare the efficacy of this vs other surgical approaches. Level of evidence: Level IV, Case Series, Treatment Study.

Objectives: To analyze the clinical and radiological outcomes of lower limb fractures following surgical treatment in patients with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). Methods: Between January 2003 and December 2015, 102 chronic SCI patients with a lower limb fracture were surgically treated at our hospital. A total of 58 patients met the inclusion criteria and were recruited for final analysis. Patients with 2-stage procedure or incomplete clinical records with lost-to-follow-up were excluded from the study. Patients were divided into 2 groups (group 1= internal fixation; group 2 = external fixation). Primary outcome measures were to identify the number of nonunions via Kaplan-Meier analysis and the time to bone consolidation. The diagnosis of a pseudarthrosis was made after more than 180 days of consolidation time. Considering the Kaplan-Meier analysis, pseudarthrosis was interpreted as treatment failure. Secondary outcome measure was to evaluate the complication rate with special focus on heterotopic ossification. Results: A total of 58 chronic SCI patients with closed bone fractures were included in this study. Fifty-two fractures (88%) were simple and 7 (12%) were complex (type C) fractures according to AO classification. The majority of patients (34 cases, 59%) developed femur fractures followed by 24 tibial fractures (41%). Seventeen patients received an external (29%) and 41 an internal fixation (71%). Bone consolidation was reported in 31 patients (53%) with a mean time interval of bone consolidation after 97 days (range from 45 to 160 days; SD = 30). The reported nonunion (pseudarthrosis) rate was 47%. Comparing the internal group (n = 15 patients) versus the external group (n = 14), we could not find any significant difference (P = .939) concerning the bone consolidation time. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a 75% cumulative survivorship at 120 days (internal group) versus 111 days (external group). Most common postoperative complications occurred in the internal fixation group with Wound infections being predominantly observed (10%), followed by heterotopic ossifications (8%). Conclusions: Our results show that surgical treatment of lower limb fractures in chronic SCI patients is a challenging treatment with a high pseudarthrosis rate in both groups. The complication rate seems to be lower in the patients treated with external fixation. As a clinical recommendation, longer implants should be used for a stable osteosynthesis since SCI patients seem to have a higher load on the osteosynthesis material due to missing sensomotoric feedback.

Materials and Materials: Between May 2001 and July 2006, 75 patients underwent syndesmotic fixation with a bioabsorbable screw. All patients had closed primary ankle fractures or dislocations with syndesmotic instability. Open reduction and internal fixation of the ankle fracture was performed using current standard orthopaedic technique. Patients were followed clinically and radiographically from 12 to 74 months with the mean being 32.5 months. Results: Seventy of 75 patients (93%) returned for the final evaluation. Mean AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot score was 90 of 100 and mean VAS for pain was 1.8 out of 10 at the time of final followup. No patients in this population showed radiographic syndesmotic instability, loss of mortise congruency, or post-traumatic arthritis in the sigmoid notch area at final followup. No patients required revision surgical fixation of the syndesmosis. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the use of bioabsorbable screw for syndesmotic fixation is associated with satisfactory restoration of ankle function and syndesmotic stability.

Materials and methods With the hypothesis that arthroplasties may have less complications without increasing mortality even for Garden I and Garden II fractures, we retrospectively reviewed 317 hips with femoral neck fractures operated between January 2015 and August 2019. The mean age at time of surgical intervention was 82.4 years (range 65 to 105). Sixty patients presented a nondisplaced hip fracture (Garden I or II) treated by internal fixtion (I-F), and 257 were treated by hip arthroplasty: 118 dual mobility total hip arthroplasty (DM-THA) and 139 with a bipolar hemiarthroplaty (B-H). Demographics, surgical and complications data, and mortality were collected and compared for each group. Results The overall mortality rate was 22.4% at two years, and similar (p = 0.98) in all groups, respectively 22%, 22%, and 23% for DM-THA, B-H, and I-F groups. With dual mobility THA, the cumulative incidence of re-operations for any reason was (lower (9%) than with internal fixation (22%) or bipolar hemiarthroplasties (19%). Conclusion Using a double mobility total prosthesis does not increase the post-operative mortality of the patients, nor does it increase their survival. But, reducing the risk of complications certainly improves their quality of life during the little time they have left .

On the other hand, resonance frequency analysis is a non-invasive and repeatable technique that has been clinically used in dentistry to evaluate implant stability e.g. by the Osstell apparatus. In this study, the characteristics of the implant stability quotient (ISQ) value obtained by the Osstell apparatus in the field of spinal surgery were investigated. Biomechanical test materials simulating human bone were used to provide a comparative platform for evaluating each fixation strength measure, including pull-out force, insertion torque, and the ISQ value. To perform pull-out force measurement and to repeat pedicle screw insertion and removal, loosening was artificially created, and its effect was investigated. The grade of loosening was quantified on a micro-CT image after pedicle screw removal. In the comparison of the 3 fixation strength measures, the correlations of the ISQ value with the pull-out force (R-2 = 0.339 p < 0.0001) and the insertion torque (R-2 = 0.337 p < 0.0001) were lower than the correlation between pull-out force and insertion torque (R-2 = 0.918 p < 0.0001). On a micro-CT study, the material volume of the internal threads disappeared after destruction of its integrity due to repeated pedicle screw insertion and removal. Material integrity destruction of the internal threads decreased only the pull-out force and the insertion torque, but it did not affect the ISQ value. The ISQ value only decreased when the material volume of the internal threads disappeared, probably because the ISQ value reflects the resistance against a force in the perpendicular direction of the screw, unlike the conventional measures of fixation strength, such as pull-out force and insertion torque, which reflect axial load.

Within this family of polymers resides the latitude to design materials with specific degradation properties to meet a variety of clinical needs. One material with an extensive clinical history is LactoSorb copolyrner, which is composed of a molar ratio of 82:18 poly(L-lactic acid)-poly(glycolic acid). Fixation devices derived from this copolymer have been used in. orthopedic and craniofacial surgeries. With a strength loss profile of approximately 12 weeks, it mirrors the profile of normal healing; however, in cases in which delayed healing is anticipated, a copolymer with a longer strength retention profile may be desirable. This study compared the hydrolytic degradation, in vitro, of the 82:18 copolymer with a related 85:15 poly(L-lactic acid)-poly(glycolic acid) copolyrner. In addition to a difference in the copolymer ratio, the latter had a larger inherent viscosity (molecular weight) and a smaller polydispersity (molecular weight distribution). This copolymer had an equivalent initial tensile modulus as the 82:18 copolymer (0.8 GPa) but a strength retention profile that spanned 44 weeks. The activation energy of hydrolysis for the 85:15 copolymer was 38.8 kcal/mol, which was greater than the 23.8 kcal/mol historical value for the 82:18 copolymer. This suggests that hydrolysis of the. 85:15 copolymer is more temperature-sensitive than that of the 82:18 copolyrner. These results were interpreted in the context of the differences in the compositions of these 2 copolymers.

All except one patient healed after the index procedure. Three patients had progressive malalignment associated with failed screw fixation but all healed without further surgical intervention. 49 out of the 59 patients returned to their baseline level of function. These results indicate that use of adjuvant bone graft materials may not be routinely necessary when treating periprosthetic femur fractures using lateral plates and biological reduction and fixation techniques.

J	Mehra, P; Murad, H				Mehra, Pushkar; Murad, Haitham			Internal Fixation of Mandibular Angle Fractures: A Comparison of 2 Techniques	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							COMPLICATIONS; MINIPLATE	Purpose: To compare treatment outcomes between rigid extraoral fixation and semirigid intraoral fixation for the management of isolated mandibular angle fractures, and to develop a protocol for successfully managing these fractures in an indigent population. Materials and Methods: This study involved a retrospective analysis of mandibular angle fracture patients treated at Boston Medical Center from 1999 to 2006. All patients were treated by a single attending surgeon, with oral and maxillofacial surgery residents. Data were collected by a review of pertinent inpatient and outpatient clinic records, and radiographic and laboratory results. The criteria for inclusion into the study comprised: 1) patients with isolated unilateral or bilateral mandibular angle fractures; 2) surgical treatment provided within 7 days of injury via I of the 2 following techniques: a) open reduction and internal fixation via an intraoral approach (single monocortical miniplate), or b) open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) via an extraoral approach (inferior border plate with at least 2 holes on either side of the fracture line and bicortical screws); 3) the presence of decayed, partially bony, or full bony impacted third molars requiring removal at time of surgery; 4) the use of postsurgical maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) for 1 week (extraoral rigid-fixation cases) and 2 weeks (intraoral semirigid-fixation cases) and 5) a 1-week duration of postsurgical oral antibiotic therapy. Results: The patient sample ranged in age from 17 to 55 years, with an average age of 24.8 years. The average follow-up was 12.3 weeks (range, 8 to 64 weeks). In total, 98 fractures were treated with intraoral miniplate fixation, whereas 65 fractures underwent rigid fixation using an extraoral approach. The presence or absence of bone gaps in radiographs immediately after surgery had no correlation with surgical success. None of the patients in either group required further surgical intervention in the operating room. Patients with postsurgical infections were successfully managed with localized intraoral incision and drainage, and oral antibiotic therapy. Conclusion: Isolated mandibular angle fractures can be effectively treated in an indigent population with either intraoral monocortical fixation or extraoral bicortical fixation techniques. Use of a standard protocol involving early surgical management with limited periosteal reflection, concomitant removal of third molars, and short-term maxillomandibular fixation ensures predictable success with a low incidence of complications.

The aim of this study was to investigate plates and screws made of magnesium for osteosynthesis in comparison to titanium in a cranial fracture model. Implants were used for internal fixation of a cranio-osteoplasty in nine minipigs. Computed tomography was conducted repeatedly after surgery. The implants and the adjacent tissues were harvested 10, 20 and 30 weeks after surgery and investigated by micro computed tomography and histological analysis. The surgical procedure and the inserted osteosynthesis material were well tolerated by the animals, and the bone healing of the osteoplasty was undisturbed at all times. The adjacent bone showed formation of lacunas in the magnesium group, resulting in a lower bone-to-implant contact ratio than that of titanium (72 vs. 94% at week 30), but this did not lead to clinical side effects. Radiological measurements showed no reduction in osteosynthesis material volume, but indicated signs of degradation: distinct volumes within the magnesium osteosynthesis group had lower density in micro-computed tomography, and these volumes increased up to 9% at week 30. The histological preparations showed areas of translucency and porosity inside the magnesium, but the outer shape of the osteosynthesis material remained unchanged. No fracture or loosening of the osteosynthesis devices appeared. Soft tissue probes confirmed sufficient biocompatibility. Given their biodegradable capacity, biocompatibility, mechanical strength and visibility on radiographs, osteosynthesis plates made of magnesium alloys are suitable for internal fixation procedures. Statement of Significance To the best of our knowledge this is the first study that used biodegradable magnesium implants for osteosynthesis in a cranial fracture model. The cranio-osteoplasty in miniature pigs allowed in vivo application of plate and screw osteosynthesis of standard-sized implants and the implementation of surgical procedures similar to those conducted on human beings. The osteosynthesis configuration, size, and mechanical properties of the magnesium implants within this study were comparable to those of titanium-based osteosynthesis materials. The results clearly show that bone healing was undisturbed in all cases and that the biocompatibility to hard- and soft tissue was sufficient. Magnesium implants might help to avoid long-term complications and secondary removal procedures due to their biodegradable properties. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Orthognathic surgery was performed on 101 patients. Bilateral sagittal ramus osteotomy was performed on 55 patients using bioabsorbable osteosynthesis in 26 and titanium osteosynthesis in 29 patients. Le Fort 1 osteotomy was performed on 28 patients with bioabsorbable and titanium osteosynthesis in 17 and 11 patients, respectively. Bimaxillary osteotomies were performed on 18 patients (8 were fixated with bioabsorbable and 10 with titanium osteosynthesis). Poly-70L/30DL-lactide copolymer (PLDLA) consisting of 70% L-lactide and 30% DL-lactide was used as the bioabsorbable osteosynthesis material. These plates and screws were compared with corresponding titanium materials. Statistically a clear relapse tendency was seen in skeletal measurements in all patient groups but without clinical importance. Radiological follow-up time was at least 18.3 months and clinical follow-up time at least 6.3 years. The materials used did not cause any adverse reaction except in three cases, one in the bioabsorbable group and two in the titanium group where fistula in connection with the osteosynthesis material was noted resulting in removal of the materials.

Although infection is not a frequent complication, it is certainly one of the most dreaded. The purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with infection after TKA. Between 1995 and 2006, 2,022 primary TKAs in 1,146 patients were evaluated. Flexible Nichidai Knee (FNK) was used as a prothesis in all subjects. Twenty-four patient-specific data items were collected via chart review for each patient. Revision arthroplasty procedures and infected knees were excluded. The medical records were reviewed to extract the following information: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP), preoperative erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), preoperative total protein (TP), duration of surgery, operative blood loss, total blood loss, duration of surgical drain, duration of antibiotic prophylaxis, primary diagnoses, smoking, diabetes mellitus, steroid or disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) therapy, previous operation around the knee joint, previous arthroscopic surgery, previous non-arthroscopic surgery, previous high tibial osteotomy (HTO) or open reduction internal fixation (ORIF), remnants of previous internal fixation material, bone graft, patella replacement, and bone cement. The median age of the patients at the time of primary TKA was 72 (range, 26-91) years. The median follow-up period after primary TKA was 42 (range, 6-145) months. During the study period, 17 infected knee arthroplasties in 17 patients were identified. Previous history of ORIF, male gender, remnants of previous internal fixation material, and BMI showed significant correlation with postoperative infection. This study identified previous history of fracture and remnants of internal fixation as major risk factors of infection after TKA. For clinical relevance, surgeons should be aware of potential infection when performing TKA in patients with these risk factors and patients should be informed of the potential risks. III.

JOURNAL OF CRANIO-MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article						Orthognathic surgery; Temporomandibular joint; Finite element analysis; Miniplates; Bicortical screws	SPLIT-RAMUS OSTEOTOMY; RIGID INTERNAL-FIXATION; L-LACTIC ACID; FORT-I OSTEOTOMY; SKELETAL STABILITY; CONDYLAR POSITION; PLATE FIXATION; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; SCREW FIXATION; SURGERY	Purpose: Sagittal split ramus osteotomy (SSRO) is a standard procedure in which miniplates and screws are used to achieve stabilization. Although the titanium plate and screw fixation system is stable, resorbable fixation systems are also used. There is currently no consensus on the ideal fixation technique for SSRO procedures and its effect on the condyle. We aimed to evaluate the stress distribution on temporomandibular joints (TMJ). Methods: A 3D finite element model of a hemimandible was designed and 5 mm advancement was simulated on a computer model. Four different fixation techniques were applied: inverted-L shaped bicortical screws, L-shaped bicortical screws, miniplate with monocortical screws, and miniplate with monocortical screws and bicortical screw. Computer models were prepared twice for resorbable and titanium material. Load of 600N and muscle forces were applied. In the finite element analysis, computer models simulated and analyzed stress distribution of bone, fixation materials and condyle. Results: Bicortical screws increase the total stress on TMJ, and the stress is located more on the posterior part than the anterior. Miniplates decrease the stress, and the forces are located more on the anterior aspect of the TMJ. Conclusion: According to our analysis, the use of bicortical screws increases the stress amount on the condyle. For the patients with a tendency toward temporomandibular disorders, using miniplate fixation techniques may decrease the forces around the condyle. These findings should be useful for oral surgeons when deciding on the most appropriate fixation technique in patients with a tendency toward temporomandibular joint disorders.

Outcome of locking compression plates in humeral shaft nonunions	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Nonunion humerus; internal fixation of humerus; locking compression plates; osteosynthesis	OSTEOPOROTIC FRACTURES; DIAPHYSEAL FRACTURES; INTRAMEDULLARY NAIL; OPERATIVE TREATMENT; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; FIXATION; MANAGEMENT; FAILURE; GRAFT	Background: Nonunion of diaphyseal fractures of the humerus are frequently seen in clinical practice (incidence of up to 15% in certain studies) and osteosynthesis using dynamic compression plates, intra medullary nails and Ilizarov fixators have been reported previously. Locking compression plates (LCP) are useful in the presence of disuse osteoporosis, segmental bone loss and cortical defects that preclude strong fixation. We report a prospective followup study of the outcome of the use of LCP for humeral nonunion following failed internal fixation in which implants other than LCP had been used. Materials and Methods: Twenty four patients with nonunion of humeral shaft fractures following failed internal fixation were included in the study. The mean followup period was 3.4 years (range: 2.4 to 5.7 years) and the minimum followup period was 2 years. Mean age of the patients was 41.04 years (range: 24 to 57 years). All 24 patients underwent osteosynthesis using LCP and autologous bone grafting (cortico-cancellous iliac crest graft combined with or without fibular strut graft). Main outcome measurements included radiographic assessment of fracture union and pre and postoperative functional evaluation using the modified Constant and Murley scoring system. Results: 23 out of 24 fractures united following osteosynthesis. Average time to union was 16 weeks (range: 10 to 28 weeks). Complications included delayed union (n = 2), transient radial nerve palsy (n = 2) and persistent nonunion (n = 1). Functional evaluation using the Constant and Murley score showed excellent results in 11, good in 10, fair in two and poor outcome in one patient. Conclusions: Locking compression plating and cancellous bone grafting is a reliable option for achieving union in humeral diaphyseal nonunion with failed previous internal fixation and results in good functional outcome in patients with higher physiological demands.

The purpose of this study is to compare and identify the surgical technique with the best outcomes for the treatment of intra-articular calcaneal fractures. Materials and methods: This is a retrospective multicentric study conducted between February 2000 and June 2014 in 206 patients with intra-articular calcaneal fractures presenting to the outpatient or emergency department of three different orthopaedic departments. The patients were treated with one of the following techniques: 1. Open reduction and internal fixation with screws and plate; 2. Percutaneous reduction and monolateral external fixation; and 3. Balloon-assisted reduction, pin fixation and tricalcium phosphate augmentation. Results: Patients treated with open reduction and internal fixation using an extensive lateral approach had a mean AOFAS score of 71 points; those treated through a minimal incision and reduction and fixation with an external fixator had a mean score of 83.1 points; and those treated with the balloon-assisted reduction, pin fixation and tricalcium phosphate augmentation had a mean score of 78.75 points. No statistically difference was found comparing the three types of treatment. Conclusion: Displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures are still technically demanding injuries to manage. The results of this study suggest that in comparison to open reduction, a percutaneous reduction and fixation leads to higher but not statistical functional scores minimizing the wound-healing complications.

Mean patient age was 22.5 (20-25) years. Ten patients had type D2 scaphoid nonunions with a fracture line in the middle one third, one patient had type D2 nonunion with a fracture line in the proximal one third, and one patient had type D1 distal one-third fibrous union. The mean wrist score (modified Mayo wrist score) was 20.8 (10-40) preoperatively and improved after 22-80 months (55-90). All nonunions healed, and the mean solid union time was 4.5 (3.5-7) months. We obtained excellent results in five patients, good results in four, fair results in two, and a poor result in one. The results of this study offer a valid alternative in the fixation of scaphoid nonunions. The major advantage of biodegradable materials is to eliminate the requirement for the removal of the fixation material.

Growth deformity may occur after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; therefore, skeletal age is used to help guide the choice between physeal sparing and transphyseal techniques. Arthrofibrosis after tibial spine fracture fixation can be reduced by initiating immediate range of motion and should be treated early and cautiously to avoid iatrogenic fracture. Nonunions of medial epicondyle elbow fractures are more common with nonoperative treatment but seldom lead to clinical problems outside of certain athletes. Risks of OCD fixation are specific to the material of screw used.

The Treatment of Proximal Humerus Fracture Using Internal Fixation With Fixed-angle Plates A Randomized Controlled Study Comparing Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polyetheretherketone With Titanium	DEUTSCHES ARZTEBLATT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							ANGULAR STABLE PLATE; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; OPEN REDUCTION; LOCKING PLATE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; COMPLICATIONS; MULTICENTER; STRATEGIES; IMPLANT	Background: Implants made of various types of material can be used for the internal fixation of fractures. Carbon fiber reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFR-PEEK) is a radiolucent material that may have advantageous handling properties compared with titanium implants. Methods: Seventy-six patients with proximal humerus fractures requiring surgery were randomized to receive a fixed-angle plate made out of either titanium or CFR-PEEK. To measure the functional outcome, the DASH score (Disabilities of Arm. Shoulder, and Hand: primary endpoint). the Simple Shoulder Test (SST). and the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) were determined in 63 patients at 6 weeks, 12 weeks. and 6 months after surgery, accompanied at each time point by radiological evaluation. Results: Both groups displayed improvement in DASH scores 6 months after surgery (CFR-PEEK: 27.5 +/- 20.5: titanium: 28.5 +/- 17.9; p = 0.82). Sensitivity analysis with multiple imputations confirmed this result (27.4 +/- 19.2 versus 28.5 +/- 16.6). The OSS and SST scores were likewise improved in both groups. All patients displayed full bony consolidation 12 weeks after surgery. In no case was material failure, secondary dislocation, or screw perforation seen. No difference was seen in the maintenance of postoperative reposition between the CFR-PEEK group and the titanium group. Conclusion: The internal fixation of proximal humerus fractures with either CFR-PEEK or titanium led to clinical improvement 6 months after surgery. No clinical or radiological difference in outcomes was seen between the two groups. Because of the study design. however. the equivalence of the two interventions was not conclusively demonstrated; a non-inferiority study would have been needed for this purpose.

An integer programming model for distal humerus fracture fixation planning	COMPUTER AIDED SURGERY			English	Article						distal humerus fracture fixation; surgical pre-planning; computer assisted orthopaedic surgery	INTERCONDYLAR FRACTURES; MAP OPTIMIZATION; INTENSITY; CLASSIFICATION	Objective: To demonstrate the feasibility of an integer programming model to assist in pre-operative planning for open reduction and internal fixation of a distal humerus fracture. Materials and Methods: We describe an integer programming model based on the objective of maximizing the reward for screws placed while satisfying the requirements for sound internal fixation. The model maximizes the number of bicortical screws placed while avoiding screw collision and favoring screws of greater length that cross multiple fracture planes. Results: The model was tested on three types of total articular fractures of the distal humerus. Solutions were generated using 5, 9, 21 and 33 possible screw orientations per hole. Solutions generated using 33 possible screw orientations per hole and five screw lengths resulted in the most clinically relevant fixation plan and required the calculation of 1, 191,975 pairs of screws that resulted in collision. At this level of complexity, the pre-processor took 104 seconds to generate the constraints for the solver, and a solution was generated in under one minute in all three cases. Conclusion: Despite the large size of this problem, it can be solved in a reasonable amount of time, making use of the model practical in pre-surgical planning.

A total of 30 patients with displaced transverse patellar fracture were enrolled in this prospective study. Of the 30 patients, 20 patients had trauma due to fall, 5 due to road traffic accident, 2 due to fall of heavy object on the knee, 2 due to forced flexion of knee, and 1 had fracture due to being beaten. All 30 patients were treated with vertical skin exposure, fracture open reduction, and internal fixation by anterior TBW through 4.0 mm cannulated screws. The postoperative rehabilitation protocol was standardized. The patients were followed postsurgery to evaluate time required for radiographic bone union, knee joint range of motion (ROM), loss of fracture reduction, material failure, and the overall functional result of knee using Bostman scoring. All the fractures healed radiologically, at an average time of 10.7 weeks (range, 8-12 weeks). The average ROM arc was 129.7 degrees (range, 115-140 degrees). No patient had loss of fracture reduction, implant migration, or material failure. The average Bostman score was 28.6 out of 30. Anterior TBW through cannulated screws for displaced transverse fractures is safe and effective alternative treatment. Good functional results and recovery can be expected.

Muthukumar			A Novel Approach in the Management of Tibial Plateau Fractures with Compartment Syndrome	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Impending Compartment syndrome; Fasciotomy; Tibial plateau fractures	INVASIVE STABILIZATION SYSTEM; FIXATION	BackgroundCompartment syndrome in tibial plateau fractures presents a formidable challenge for treating orthopedic surgeons. The most common strategy is early fasciotomy and external fixation, followed by a second stage definitive fixation. We conducted a prospective study of tibial plateau fractures of Schatzker Type V and VI with impending compartment syndrome treated by single-stage double incision fasciotomy and dual internal fixation and Vacuum-Assisted Closure (VAC).Materials and MethodsThe study was between May 2014 and February 2019. 21 patients with impending compartment syndrome who underwent single-stage double incision fasciotomy and Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF) with dual plate were included in the study. The functional and radiological outcome was measured using the modified Rasmussen functional and radiological scoring and The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC).ResultsThe mean age of patients was 38.7 years (Standard deviation of & PLUSMN; 9.48). The mean follow-up period was 27 months (Standard deviation of & PLUSMN; 6.51). The mean functional and radiological modified Rasmussen score was 27.28 (range 21 to 29) & 8 (range 7 to 10), respectively. 4 patients had excellent outcomes, and 17 patients had good results. The mean WOMAC score was 8.04 (Standard deviation of & PLUSMN; 5.35). Five patients had a score of 0, 14 patients had a score of 1-10 and 2 had a score of 11-20.ConclusionsThe early double incision fasciotomy and definitive internal fixation with dual plate and VAC as single-stage surgery in patients with impending compartment syndrome help to obtain excellent to good functional outcomes with reduced complications.

The optimal fixation method of these intraarticular fractures remains controversial; improper or unstable fixation usually lead to an unsatisfactory prognosis. The use of posterior-anterior or reversed lag screw fixation is still a popular method. Additional buttress plating is also recommended for fixation of these difficult fractures. The purpose of this study was to compare the mechanical strength of four different fixation patterns for this uncommon fracture. Material and methods: Sixteen sawbone simulated models of Letenneur type I Hoffa fractures were created with one of four fixation patterns: two screws implanted in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction or posterior-anterior (PA) direction; one screw in the PA direction with a plate implanted in the posterior position of the distal femoral condyle or with a plate in the lateral position. Biomechanical testing was performed to determine the post-fixation axial stiffness, the maximum load to failure and the fragment vertical displacement for each of the four constructs. Results: The plate fixation patterns whether implanted in the posterior or lateral position were shown to provide higher overall axial stiffness and load to failure, and less vertical displacement than the other two patterns of pure screw fixation. Among these constructs, the lateral plate fixation was found to provide the highest stiffness and load to failure and the least displacement for the posterior condylar fragments, followed by the posterior plate fixation. The lowest overall stiffness and load to failure and the largest vertical displacement were found in the construct with the AP direction placed screws. Conclusion: It was concluded that the lateral position implanted plate is biomechanically the strongest fixation method for Letenneur type I Hoffa fractures. However, this plate fixation is not recommended for all cases. The choice of internal fixation pattern depends on the surgeons. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Malatray, M; Fessy, MH; Besse, JL				Malatray, Matthieu; Fessy, Michel Henri; Besse, Jean-Luc			Comparison of screw versus locked plate fixation for Scarf osteotomy treatment of hallux valgus	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Scarf osteotomy; Secondary impaction; Screw; Plate; Recurrence of deformity	MINI-C-ARM; FOLLOW-UP; RADIATION-EXPOSURE; RECURRENCE; DEFORMITY; OUTCOMES	Introduction: The Scarf osteotomy is a commonly used surgical procedure for treating hallux valgus in Europe. Screw fixation is standard practice, although some surgeons now go without internal fixation. Plate fixation is still being studied. The aim of this study was to compare the radiological outcomes of these fixation methods, which has not been performed up to now. Hypothesis : Relative to screw fixation, plate fixation of a Scarf osteotomy of the first metatarsal (M1) prevents secondary impaction, without increasing the complication rate or recurrence rate. Materials and methods: A retrospective study was performed of two internal fixation methods for Scarf osteotomy (screw vs. plate), by analyzing the secondary impaction of the first metatarsal, recurrence of the hallux valgus (angle M1P1 > 20) on X-rays, incidence of complications and potential discomfort related to the hardware. The osteotomy procedure was the same in both groups: 50 patients were included consecutively in each fixation group between February 2014 and November 2015. Results: The mean follow-up was 13.0 +/- 2.7 months in the screw group and 12.3 +/- 1.1 months in the plate group. There were no severe complications, although four cases of delayed wound healing occurred (3 in plate group, 1 in screw group). In the screw group, there was one case of secondary impaction, two cases of recurrence (4%) and one case of discomfort. In the plate group, there were no cases of impaction, three recurrences (6%) and five cases of discomfort, leading to plate removal in three of these cases. Discussion: There was no significant difference between groups in the M1 secondary impaction rate or recurrence rate: screw fixation did not lead to a higher recurrence rate. Systematic fixation with a locked plate for Scarf osteotomy had no advantages over screw fixation in our study. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Patients were divided into four groups based on their fixation techniques: hybrid technique (HT) groups I, II, and IV received a 4-hole 2 mm miniplate with either a bicortical screw (BS), additional 2 mm 4-hole miniplate, or two-hole miniplate, while non-HT group III received a 4-hole 2 mm miniplate with four mini-screws (MS). Measurements were taken pre-operatively (T0), immediately postoperatively (T1), and >= 1 year after surgery (T2) using 3D Slicer software.Results: Age, sex, and follow-up period did not correlate significantly with postoperative relapse or stability. Significant differences were observed in the advancement on the right side between groups II, III, and IV and on the left side between groups I, III, and IV. However, the type of surgical intervention showed no significant effect on postoperative relapse and stability. All groups of fixations showed satisfactory stability with irrelevant relapse (< 2 mm or 2 degrees).Conclusion: The study demonstrated satisfactory and comparable stability among different fixation groups on patients undergoing mandibular advancement following bilateral split sagittal osteotomy. The results highlighted the importance of considering the degree of advancement when planning orthognathic surgery and managing postoperative outcomes.

This fixation is usually achieved by means of devices such as plates, pins, and screws. These traditional fixation strategies are associated with severe drawbacks, which have prompted research and development of a variety of bone-adhesive biomaterials as alternative. However, a clinically applicable bone-adhesive biomaterial-in the form of a bone-glue or bone-adhesive membrane-that meets all requirements has not yet been identified. This perspective article discusses the current state of the art of bone-adhesive materials with a particular focus on their clinical requirements, mechanisms of action, and future perspective. To develop adhesive biomaterials with specific affinity to bone tissue, a more rational design should be implemented. This perspective article is intended as a starting point and inspiration for future research and development of suitable bone-adhesive materials.	[Sanchez-Fernandez, Maria J.; Leeuwenburgh, Sander C.

However, whether bone plate fixation or only lag screw fixation is more preferable remains unclear. Few studies have evaluated whether screw fixation can provide biomechanical fixation strength similar to bone plate fixation. Objective We assessed the difference in fixation strength between fixtation with two lag screws and bone plate for oblique metacarpal shaft fractures. Materials and methods We created oblique metacarpal shaft fractures on 21 artificial bones and fixated them using (1) double lag screw (2LS group), (2) regular plate (RP group), or (3) locked plate (LP group). To obtain the force-displacement data, a cantilever bending test was conducted for each specimen through a material testing machine. One-way analysis of variance and a Tukey test were conducted to compare the maximum fracture force and stiffness of the three fixation methods. Results The maximum fracture force of the 2LS group (mean + SD: 153.6 +/- 26.5 N) was significantly lower than that of the RP (211.6 +/- 18.5 N) and LP (227.5 +/- 10.0 N) groups (p < 0.001). However, no significant differences were discovered between the RP and LP groups. The coefficient of variation for the maximum fracture force of the 2LS group (17.3%) was more than twice as high as that of the RP (8.7%) and LP (4.4%) groups. In addition, the stiffness of the three fixation methods was similar. Conclusion Compared with bone plate fixation, double lag screw fixation yielded slightly lower maximum bearable fracture force but similar stiffness. Therefore, this technique could be used for treating oblique metacarpal shaft fractures. However, using double lag screw fixation alone is technically demanding and requires considerable surgical experiences to produce consistent results.

Therefore we established a new protocol for closed reduction and internal fixation (CRIF) using cannulated screws combined with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) composite materials to treat acute femoral neck fractures. This study enrolled 78 patients with acute femoral neck fractures between April 2014 and September 2016. We treated 46 patients with a mean age of 43.8 years in study group. These patients were treated by CRIF combined with BMP-2 composite materials. In control group, there were 32 patients with a mean age of 42.09 years. The patients were treated by CRIF without BMP-2. The duration between presentation and surgery, operative time, Harris score and complications were recorded. In study group, 43 patients were followed up with an average of 31.3 months. One patient suffered nonunion and three patients presented AVN. In control group, 28 patients were followed up with an average of 32.3 months, the rate of AVN and fracture nonunion were 25% (7/28) and 21.4% (6/28) respectively, significantly higher than those in study group (P < .05). Acute displaced femoral neck fractures can be treated with CRIF and BMP-2 composite materials in a minimally invasive manner. This technique was reproducible and had fewer complications.

Materials and Methods This retrospective single-center study analyzed 9 consecutive cancer patients managed with percutaneous FICS for sternal fracture fixation or osteolytic metastasis consolidation, from May 2014 to February 2019. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and opioid use were studied preoperatively and postoperatively. Sternal images at last follow-up appointment were also collected. Results Among the 9 patients, 7 had a sternal fracture with 5 being displaced. The technical feasibility was 100%. Both NPRS score significantly decreased from 5.6/10 +/- 2.8 to 1.1/10 +/- 1.6, and analgesic consumption was significantly improved (p = 0.03) after intervention. No post-procedural complications requiring surgical correction or screw displacement occurred after a mean imaging follow-up that exceeded 1 year (mean follow-up duration, 401.8 days +/- 305.8). Conclusion Image-guided sternal percutaneous FICS is feasible and safe. It reduces pain and analgesic consumption related to pathologic fracture of the sternum.

However, the elastic moduli of these materials differ from that of human cortical bone, and the stress shielding effect affects fracture healing, leading to secondary fractures. Herein, a new porous Ta coated SiC (pTa-SiC) scaffold using in internal fixation devices with good mechanical and biological properties was prepared based on porous silicon carbide (SiC) scaffold and tantalum (Ta) metal. The osteogenic and osseointegration properties of the pTa-SiC scaffold were investigated by both in vitro and in vivo tests. The results showed that compared with porous titanium (pTi), the pTa-SiC promoted the proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Moreover, the internal fixation tests were carried out in a goat load-bearing femoral neck fracture model. Histological results showed good osseointegration around the pTa-SiC screws. And the acid etching results showed that bone cells grew tightly on the pTa-SiC throughout bone canaliculi, and the growth mode was contact osteogenesis, which indicated good biological fixation effects. Therefore, it is reasonable to be expected that the new pTa-SiC scaffold with excellent mechanical and biological properties could be a promising candidate for bone implant field.

Minimally Invasive Stent Screw-Assisted Internal Fixation Technique Corrects Kyphosis in Osteoporotic Vertebral Fractures with Severe Collapse: A Pilot Vertebra Plana Series	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							BALLOON KYPHOPLASTY; COMPRESSION FRACTURES; DEFORMITY CORRECTION; PERCUTANEOUS VERTEBROPLASTY; PEDICLE SCREWS; SPINE; CEMENT; CLASSIFICATION; AUGMENTATION; BODY	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fractures with vertebra plana morphology are characterized by severe vertebral body collapse and segmental kyphosis; there is no established treatment standard for these fractures. Vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplasty might represent an undertreatment, but surgical stabilization is challenging in an often elderly osteoporotic population. This study assessed the feasi-bility, clinical outcome, and radiologic outcome of the stent screw-assisted internal fixation technique using a percutaneous implant of vertebral body stents and cement-augmented pedicle screws in patients with non-neoplastic vertebra plana fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven consecutive patients with vertebra plana fractures were treated with the stent screw-assisted internal fixation technique. Vertebral body height, local and vertebral kyphotic angles, outcome scales (numeric rating scaleand the Patient's Global Impression of Change), and complications were assessed. Imaging and clinical follow-up were obtained at 1and 6 months post-procedure. RESULTS: Median vertebral body height restoration was 7 mm (+74%), 9 mm (+150%), and 3 mm (+17%) at the anterior wall, middle body, and posterior wall, respectively. Median local and vertebral kyphotic angles correction was 8 degrees and 10 degrees and was maintained through the 6-month follow-up. The median numeric rating scale score improved from 8/10 preprocedure to 3/10 at 1 and6 months (P < .001). No procedural complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The stent screw-assisted internal fixation technique was effective in obtaining height restoration, kyphosis correction, and pain relief in patients with severe vertebral collapse.

JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Conversion total hip arthroplasty; hip fracture; post-traumatic osteoarthritis; sonication; intraoperative cultures; contamination; periprosthetic joint infection	PROSTHETIC JOINT INFECTIONS; FEMORAL-NECK FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; DIAGNOSIS	Objective To examine sonication results in presumed aseptic conversion total hip arthroplasty (THA) after hip fracture fixation and to evaluate its implications on the treatment outcome. Methods This retrospective cohort study reviewed the data from presumed aseptic patients that underwent conversion of prior internal fixation of proximal femoral fractures to THA between 2012 and 2018. Microbiological analysis was performed using sonication of osteosynthesis material and tissue samples. Treatment outcome including the occurrence of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) was recorded. Results A total of 32 patients were included in the study. Of these, five patients (15.6%) had positive intraoperative cultures. The mean follow-up following conversion THA was 43.0 months (range, 19.0-91.5 months). Sonication was positive in three patients (9.4%), all of whom were deemed contaminated and did not develop PJI. Tissue cultures were positive in two patients (6.3%). One patient with Enterococcus faecalis received antibiotic treatment and did not develop PJI. Another patient with growth of Cutibacterium acnes that was initially classified as a contaminant later developed acute PJI caused by the same pathogen. Overall, PJI occurred in two patients (6.3%) after conversion THA. Conclusion Sonication of internal fixation devices did not add diagnostic value in clinically aseptic conversion THA. Further studies are needed to better understand the relevance of unexpected positive cultures, and to develop diagnostic criteria for the management of these patients.

Design: Ex vivo paired cadaveric Study. Setting: Biomechanical laboratory. 21 Materials: Five pairs of fresh, elderly cadaveric humeri. Intervention: Two 3.5-mm reconstruction plates were used to stabilize each humerus. This fixation model was selected solely to evaluate the effect of K-wire augmentation. Augmentation consisted of 2 K-wires placed in both the medial and lateral columns of the humerus to interdiaitate with the plate screws. A posteriorly directed load was cyclically applied to the distal fragment for 5000 cycles or until failure, and osteotomy site motion was tracked optically. Main Outcome Measurements: Fixation survival was defined as 5000 cycles or the number of cycles until osteotorny site motion reached > 2 mm. Results: K-wire auamented fixations survived significantly more cycles than did controls (4410 +/- 875 vs. 1114 +/- 2 182, respectively; paired t test, P < 0.05). Conclusions: Augmentation with K-wires may decrease the incidence of loss of fixation in distal humeral fractures.

A simple external fixator for complex finger fractures	ACTA ORTHOPAEDICA BELGICA			English	Article						hand; phalanges; metacarpals; fractures; external fixator	INTRAARTICULAR FRACTURES; HAND; PHALANGEAL	Complex fractures of phalangeal bones in the hand are difficult to treat. External fixation is an effective method of treatment particularly when internal fixation is not possible due to comminution and associated soft tissue injury. A variety of commercial fixators are available for the treatment of hand fractures. However, these fixators are costly and need a sufficient degree of expertise and familiarity for their use. We describe a very simple fixator which is stable, lightweight and can be easily constructed with materials readily available in most trauma theatres.

Methods: Twenty-eight knees of 28 patients [19 males and 9 females; mean age, 41.2 years (range 22-72 years)] who had open reduction and internal fixation combined with CPC augmentation were included in this study. Seventeen fractures were Schatzker type II, 5 were type HI, 3 were type IV, 2 were type V, and 1 was type VI. CPC was used to fill the subchondral bone defects in all knees. Fixation of the fragments was done with screws in 3 knees (10%). Standard proximal tibial plates or buttress plates were used in 25 knees (90%) with an additional split fragment extending distally to achieve internal fixation. Full weight-bearing was allowed in 6.4 weeks (range 6-12 weeks) after surgery. Resorption of CPC granules was defined as the decrease in the size and density of grafting material on radiographs. Rasmussen's radiological and clinical scores were determined postoperatively. Functionality was assessed with Lysholm knee scoring system. Activity was graded with Tegner's activity scale. Results: Union was achieved in all patients with a mean follow-up of 22.2 months (range 6-36 months). There were no intraoperative complications. At the latest follow-up radiographs, resorption of the graft was observed in 25 knees (89%). Rasmussen's radiologic score was excellent in 17 patients (61%), good in 9 patients (32%), and fair in 2 patients (7%). Rasmussen's clinical score was excellent in 9 patients (32%), good in 18 patients (64%), and fair in 1 patient (4%). According to the Lysholm knee score, functional results were excellent in 16 patients (57%), good in 8 patients (29%), and fair in 4 patients (14%). Twenty-two patients (78%) achieved the preoperative activity level after surgery, and there was no significant difference between the mean preoperative and postoperative Tegner scores (4.11 +/- 0.68 and 4.04 +/- 0.64, respectively, p=0.161). Conclusion: CPC is a safe biomaterial with many advantages in augmenting the open reduction and internal fixation of depressed tibial plateau fractures, including elimination of morbidity associated with bone graft harvesting, the unlimited supply of bone substitute, the optimum filling of irregular bone defects, and shortening of the postoperative full weight-bearing time.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective evaluation was made of all the cases of trimalleolar fractures over a 9-year period in a trauma center. Patients aged 18 70 years were enrolled in the study. Patients were separated into 2 groups according to the fixation method (A - P percutaneous screw, and posterior open reduction internal fixation). The fractures were classified according to the AO classification system and the Haraguchi posterior malleolar fracture classification system. The FAOS and SF-36 scores, postoperative reduction quality, arthritis scores and minor major complications were evaluated. RESULTS 86 patients were found to eligible for the study. The PMF was fixed using anteroposterior percutaneous screw in 50 (58.1 %) patients and with posterior open reduction-internal fixation in 36 (41.9 %) patients. AO 44 B type fracture was determined in 89.5 % of the patients, AO 44 C type was seen in 10.5 %. There were 27 patients (31.4 %) with Haraguchi type 1 fracture and 59 patients (68.6 %) with type 2 fracture. The mean step-off of the articular surface was statistically greater in Group 1 than in Group 2. No statistically significant difference was determined between the two groups in respect of syndesmosis malreduction. The mean arthritis score was higher in Group 1 than in Group 2. Mean scores of the SF-36 and FAOS questionnaire was statistically significantly improved in the patients with open reduction and internal fixation. DISCUSSION Although there is no consensus on the treatment of posterior malleolar fractures, the indication for surgery is mainly based on posterior fragment size in the literature. The anatomic articular reduction has been emphasized recently. In this study, it was determined that the anatomic articular reduction was correlated with better surgical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS The study results demonstrated that better functional and radiological outcomes was observed with direct open reduction and fixation of the posterior fragment than indirect reduction and percutaneous fixation in the patients with trimalleolar fracture. The arthritis risk and patient satisfaction were seen to be correlated with the anatomic reduction of the articular surface.

A newly designed locked intramedullary nail for trochanteric hip fractures fixation: Results of the first 100 Trochanteric™ implantations	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Trochanteric fractures; Hip fractures; Internal fixation; Locked nail	PROXIMAL FEMORAL FRACTURES; SCREW; PLATE; DHS	Introduction. - Internal fixation continues to be the surgical treatment of choice for trochanteric region hip fractures. Intramedullary nailing is the updated version of the Kuntscher Y nail and provides stable osteosynthesis of trochanteric hip fractures, classically achieved by closed reduction. Material and methods. - We report on our experience (which started in 2003), using a new fixation device featuring a metaphyseal antegrade nail locked with two cephalic screws and comprising a diaphyseal distal locking. Between April 2003 and September 2006, the first 100 patients who sustained an extracapsular intertrochanteric hip fracture and indicated for internal fixation were prospectively enrolled in this single-center study. Results. - Eighty-six patients (mean age 80.3) were reviewed at 6 months (nine had died, three had failure and two were lost to follow-up) and reported a satisfactory functional outcome (mean Merle d'Aubigne score was 16 and mean Harris Hip score was 90). Union was achieved within a mean delay of 3 months (median 102 days 1/2) in a good anatomical position (mean medialization was 1.86-ranging from-16 to 0 mm, and mean shortening was 1.72mm-ranging from 0 to 24 mm). Functional recovery was satisfactory with a mean Parker score of 7.52. Total operating time was shortened and good fracture stabilization allowed early weight bearing. Discussion. - Classically, such intertrochanteric fractures can be managed either with a dynamic screw-plate type fixation or with an intramedullary nailing device locked through a single cephalic screw and finally, in rare cases, with a hip arthroplasty supplemented with some sort of fixation. Most published clinical studies of screw-plate fixations have generally reported satisfactory results except for unstable fractures associated with a calcar area lesion. Screw-nail fixations featuring a single cephalic screw should be used in these latter fracture patterns. We believe this new implant design will significantly enhance the anatomical result and functional outcome of these fractures; all this is expected to bring about an earlier recovery of patient's walking ability. Conclusion. - This original intramedullary nailing system provides reliable internal fixation means for intertrochanteric fractures since it combines the advantage of a closed reduction procedure with a more stable biomechanical construct.

The as-cast composite materials showed dendritic microstructure comprising of alpha-Mg as major constituent and Mg7Zn3 and Ca2Mg6Zn3 phases distributed in interdendritic zones, as revealed by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The addition of ZnO led to a 17% and 22% increase in ultimate and yield strengths in tension and a 24% and 27% enhancement in ultimate compressive and compressive yield strengths, respectively. The mechanical strengthening and observed tension-compression reversed yield asymmetry strongly correlated with the lattice distortion (c/a ratio) resulting from the macroalloying. The amplitude-dependent internal friction confirmed the presence of immobile obstacles to dislocations and their role through their hysteretic-type anelastic response. The in vitro degradation results revealed corrosion barrier effect of secondary phases. The cell adhesion, viability, and cytoskeleton observations favoured their biocompatibility except for hemolysis rate. The finite element results showed reduced stress-shielded zone for developed materials indicating the favourable mechanical environment for peri-implant tissues at fracture interface required for faster fracture healing.

Materials and Methods: Models of external-and internal-connection implants, corresponding abutments/crowns, and fixation screws were developed. These models were then imported into finite element analysis software to study the impact of forces on different implant connections and materials. Each prosthesis was subjected to a 200-N compressive shear force applied at 130 degrees relative to the long axis of the implant. The materials were considered linear, isotropic, and homogenous. The parameters changed for each connection type included: bone resorption in relation to the prosthetic platform (no, 2 mm, or 4 mm of resorption); alloys of the restorations (nonprecious vs precious); and alloys of the abutment screws (titanium vs gold). Von Mises stresses were used to display the stress in five models: implant, restoration, screw, cancellous bone, and cortical bone. Results: Statistically significant differences in the stresses of all involved structures occurred when the bone level decreased by 2 mm and by 4 mm. The connection type contributed to statistically significant differences in the stresses in both the restoration and the screw. The alloy type resulted in statistically significant differences in the implant, the superstructure, and the cortical bone stresses. Conclusion: As bone resorbed, the stresses generated within the internal-connection implant were greater than those generated in the external-connection implant. The same findings applied for the restoration and for cancellous and cortical bone. The stresses generated in the fixation screw were greater in the external-connection implant than in the internal-connection implant for all bone resorption scenarios.

The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the outcomes of transoral endoscopic-assisted open reduction and internal fixation of condylar fractures and hardware removal in pediatric patients. Material and Methods: This study was designed as a retrospective case series. The study included pe-diatric patients admitted with condylar fractures that were indicated for treatment with open reduction and internal fixation. The patients were clinically and radiographically evaluated with regard to occlusion, mouth opening, lateral and protrusive movement of the mandible, pain, chewing and speech difficulties, and bone healing at the fracture site. Computed tomography images were used to assess the reduction of the fractured segment, the stability of fixation and progress of healing of the condylar fracture at follow-up visits. The same surgical treatment approach was applied to all patients. The data from the study were analyzed for a single group without any comparison to other groups. Results: The technique was used for the treatment of 14 condylar fractures in 12 patients between the ages of 3 to 11 years. A total of 28 transoral endoscopic-assisted approaches to the condylar region either for reduction and internal fixation or hardware removal were applied. The mean operating time was 53.1 (+/- 11.3) minutes for the fracture repair and 20 (+/- 2.6) minutes for hardware removal, respectively. The mean follow-up time of the patients was 17.8 (+/- 2.7) months (median: 18) months. All patients regained stable occlusion, satisfactory mandibular motion, stable fixation, and complete bone healing at the frac-ture site at the end of their follow-up period. There was no transient of permanent facial nerve or trigem-inal nerve injury in any of the patients. Conclusions: Endoscopically assisted transoral approach is a reliable technique for reduction and inter-nal fixation of condylar fracture and hardware removal in pediatric patients. The serious risks of extraoral approaches including facial nerve injury, facial scar, and parotid fistula can be eliminated by using this tech-nique.

The purpose of this study was to analyze functional and radiographic long-term results in patients who had undergone surgical treatment of displaced greater tuberosity fractures and to compare those results with the results of patients who had been treated nonoperatively. Material: From a prospectively gathered database, we retrospectively analyzed functional and radiographic results of 52 patients with operative treatment of displaced greater tuberosity fractures at an average time of 5.5 years (range, 2-11 years) after trauma. Those results were compared with the functional and radiographic outcome of nine patients with equal injuries, who had been treated nonoperatively. Functional results were defined by three supplementary shoulder scores: the Vienna Shoulder Score (VSS), the Constant Score (CS), and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)Score. Radiographic results were assessed based on accurate radiographs in two planes (anteroposterior and axillary). Patients underwent either open reduction and internal fixation (n = 30) or closed reduction and percutaneous internal fixation (n = 22). Results: Thirty-four patients (65%) achieved good functional results (CS >80 points, VSS <8 points, UCLA >28 points) and eight patients (15%) had excellent results with a maximum of points on two of three shoulder scores. Ten patients (20%) experienced satisfactory results with two-thirds points on two of three shoulder scores. All fractures healed without any signs of nonunion or relevant loss of reduction. In nine patients (17%) we had a minimal loss of reduction (<5 mm) to superior, but there was no significant influence on shoulder function. In comparison of the operative techniques, patients with open reduction and internal fixation had slightly better functional results than did those with closed reduction and percutaneous internal fixation, but this was statistically not significant (p > 0.05). In comparison of the results of the surgical study group and the nonoperative control group, patients with reduction and fixation of greater tuberosity fractures had significantly better results on shoulder function than did those with conservative treatment (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Surgical treatment of displaced greater tuberosity fractures revealed good functional and radiographic results. Reduction and fixation of those fractures is recommended because patients with nonoperative treatment showed significantly worse results. Similar results can be achieved for open reduction and internal fixation, or closed reduction and percutaneous fixation.

Evaluation of the effect of mandibular length and height on the sagittal split ramus osteotomy rigid internal fixation techniques: A finite element analysis	JOURNAL OF STOMATOLOGY ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article						Sagittal split ramus osteotomy; Finite element analysis; Rigid internal fixation; Hybrid technique	BIOMECHANICAL EVALUATION; ADVANCEMENT SURGERY; STABILITY; STRESS; FORCES; SCREWS	Purpose: A major concern after mandibular advancement with sagittal split ramus osteotomy surgery is postoperative stability and relapse. Currently, there is no consensus on the ideal fixation technique, or how prognosis is affected by mandibular height and length. The aim of the present study was to assess stress distribution on the fixation units and the bone after sagittal split ramus osteotomy and determine the contributions of different mandibular body heights and lengths. Materials and methods: Sagittal split ramus osteotomy and mandibular advancement were simulated in different height/length models prior to fixation using a miniplate, hybrid, or inverted L system using finite element analysis. The greatest and least amount of stress was generated using the miniplate, and inverted L system, respectively. Results: The highest tension and compression in the bone was measured in the miniplate system. While the inverted L system generated less stress in the fixation units than the hybrid system, the hybrid system caused less stress in the bone and lower displacement values compared to other systems. An increase in length, and a decrease in height, both promoted stress, however, the difference was greatest in the former. Conclusion: Based on our results, when sagittal split ramus osteotomy is planned for a rather long or thin mandible, using the hybrid system for fixation is recommended. (c) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Space debris generation in GEO: Space materials testing and evaluation	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article						Space debris; Space materials; Geostationary orbit; Geostationary transfer orbit; Spacecrafts; Space environment	RADIATION	The aim of this work is to evaluate what happens to the spacecraft materials beyond the spacecraft End of Life. A review of spacecraft external materials and effects of space environment is presented. This paper results from a continued study on spacecraft material degradation, and space debris formation in geostationary orbit (GEO). In this paper a 20-year GEO dose profile that combines simultaneous UV, particles irradiation and thermal cycling was applied to a set of external spacecraft materials. These materials comprised MLI assemblies, Velcros fixation and spacecraft painting. The evaluation of these external spacecraft materials, exposed to simulated space environment have confirmed the criticality of degradation of MLI, Velcros fixation and painting, with delamination mechanisms and particulate contamination. The synergy of space radiation (particles, UV) and thermal cycling ages the material and induces mechanical stress, causing creation of brittle surfaces, cracks and delamination. These phenomena cause serious damage to exposed surfaces, changing the surfaces thermo-optical properties, and may induce the generation of space debris. In particular, experimental results show the delamination of internal MLI layers and the severe degradation of the Velcros.

JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							MINIPLATE; MANAGEMENT	Purpose: The study's purpose was to answer the following clinical question: in patients with mandibular angle fractures requiring open reduction and internal fixation, do those who have fixation screws inserted using a transbuccal approach compared with those with fixation screws inserted using a transoral approach have fewer complications after treatment? The investigators hypothesized that the transoral approach was associated with a higher risk of complications. Materials and Methods: A multicenter retrospective cohort study was performed in patients who had open reduction and internal fixation of mandibular angle fractures from 2008 to 2010 within Western Australia. Patients were divided into transbuccal and transoral groups and then further subdivided into groups with and without fixation failures (primary outcome variable) and statistically compared. Binary logistic regression was used to control for possible confounders, which included patient gender, age, a wisdom tooth within the fracture not extracted, dental caries, partial dentition, bilateral/unilateral fractures, and smoking. Results: In total 597 patients were in the study. Sixteen percent of patients in the transoral group had complications after treatment versus 10% in the transbuccal group. For the transoral technique, the odds of having fixation failure was 1.71 times greater than with the transbuccal technique (95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 2.93; P = .04). Incidences of all complication variables (hardware loosening/fracturing, wound dehiscence, secondary infection, surgery redo, nonunion/malunion of fracture, and removal of plate) were lower in the transbuccal group apart from plate fracture. Conclusion: The transbuccal technique was associated with fewer complications after treatment compared with the transoral technique.

Method: Standard mandible locking plates with identical profile height (1,5 mm), comparable length and screws with identical diameter (2,0 mm) were used. Plates were fixed with six screws according a preparation protocol. Four point bending tests were then performed using artificial bone material to compare their initial stability and failure limit under realistic loading conditions. Loading of the plates was performed using of a servo hydraulic driven testing machine. The stiffness of the implant/bone construct was calculated using a linear regression on the experimental data included in a range of applied moment between 2 Nm and 6 Nm. Results: No statistical difference in the elastic stiffness was visible between the three types of plate. However, differences were observed between the systems concerning the maximal load supported. The Stryker and Synthes systems were able to support a significantly higher moment. Conclusion: For clinical application all systems show good and reliable results. Practical aspects such as handling, possible angulation of screw fixation, possibility of screw/plate removal, etc. may favour one or the other plating system.

Twenty-four polylactic/polyglycolic acid plates (LactoSorb; Lorenz, Jacksonville, FL) were divided in 3 groups of 8 specimens each. Group A served as control, and groups B and C were immersed in 0.1 M lactic acid for 15 and 30 days, respectively. All specimens were subjected to a 3-point bending test, using a universal testing machine, and the stiffness of each specimen was estimated. When analyzed with one-way analysis of variance, no difference was observed for the control and in vitro-aged specimens with regard to stiffness. Long-term (30 d) in vitro aging of poly-L-lactic acid bioabsorbable fixation plates does not seem to significantly affect the stiffness of the material as derived from a 3-point bending test.

In neurosurgery, the reported literature is predominantly confined to pediatric craniofacial procedures, with encouraging results and minimal complications. We have used bioreabsorbable plates and screws in cranial and spinal pediatric neurosurgery procedures. We report four complications related to their usage. Materials and methods: Bioabsorbable instrumentation was used in pediatric patients for fixation of bone after cranial or spinal procedures. Results: Four patients developed complications related to the instrumentation: 2 following cranial surgery for epilepsy, 1 after correction of a growing skull fracture, and 1 after laminotomy for an intramedullary tumor. Two patients had fibrous encapsulation with granuloma formation and 2 patients had osteolysis following the fixation. Conclusions: Bioabsorbable fixation devices for the stabilization of bone following craniotomy and laminotomy in pediatric patients may be associated with complications, including granuloma formation and osteolysis.

Outcomes of Lisfranc Injuries Treated with Joint-Preserving Fixation	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society; clinical outcomes; dorsal plating; Lisfranc; midfoot	OPEN REDUCTION; FRACTURE-DISLOCATIONS; TRANSARTICULAR SCREWS; FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES; PRIMARY ARTHRODESIS; INTERNAL-FIXATION	Background Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with transarticular screws to stabilize Lisfranc injuries may increase the risk of arthritis or affect outcomes. Joint-preserving fixation using staples, bridge plating, or Lisfranc screws avoids iatrogenic articular damage. This study analyzes functional outcomes and complications in Lisfranc-injury patients who underwent joint-preserving fixation. Materials and Methods We conducted a retrospective review of patients treated for Lisfranc injury at a Level 1 trauma center from July 2008 to October 2015. Patients over 18 years of age, with no concomitant procedures in the lower extremities, were included. Functional outcomes were evaluated through American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores. Results Fourteen patients met the inclusion criteria. The average followup time was 57 months (range 22-102 months). AOFAS scores averaged 80.4 (standard deviation [SD] 16) at the time of the latest followup, with time to return to regular activities averaging 34 weeks (SD 25 weeks). Five patients had their hardware removed, and two required subsequent fusion during the followup period. The single complication involved a screw backing out, with subsequent removal. Conclusions In this case series, joint-preserving fixation for Lisfranc injuries offered similar AOFAS scores as those reported for ORIF with transarticular screws but with a decreased rate of hardware removal and need for midfoot fusion.

The injured medial column was internally fixed with compression arthrodesis. The fusion site was firmed up with BonGoldVR Bone Sponge and Bone Putty. The prognosis of fused navicular-cuneiform joint and metatarsal-cuneiform joint were examined by X-ray shortly after surgical operation and followed up 2, 4, 6, 9 and 13 weeks after the surgical operation. Themedial column was perfectly fused by compression arthrodesis. These results justified and favored the application of mineralized collagen as an excellent alternative to autograft in fusing the podarthral joints with internal fixation.

In the present study, the results obtained after grafting with autogenous bone grafts in 233 patients with facial bony defects are analyzed retrospectively. At the Department of Maxillo-Facial Surgery of the University of Rome "La Sapienza," 233 patients (127 males and 106 females) with defects in the craniofacial regions have been reconstructed using autogenous bone grafts between 1997 and 2003. Bone grafts have been obtained from calvaria (N = 29), rib (N = 35), and iliac crest (N = 169). Fixation methods were wire fixation in 72 patients treated between 1977 and 1991 and rigid internal fixation in the 161 patients treated between 1992 and 2003. In 215 cases (92%), an adequate integration of the graft at the recipient site was observed. Complications such as infection and graft resorption requiring graft removal were experienced in seven of 72 patients in which bone grafts have been fixed with wire fixation (9.7%) and in 11 of the 161 patients in which bone grafts have been fixed with rigid internal fixation (6.4%). Even today, revascularized free flaps are the first choice in case of extensive bony defects; in selected cases, bone grafts continue to represent a valid therapeutic option.

Pelvic ring fractures internal fixation: Iliosacral screws versus sacroiliac hinge fixation	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Sacroiliac fixation; Pelvic ring fractures; Iliosacral screw; Biomechanics	DISLOCATIONS	Introduction: Pelvic ring fractures are severe injuries whose functional results depend on the quality of reduction. Numerous internal fixation alternatives have been described, but the biomechanical studies comparing them remain rare. Hypothesis: This study compared the biomechanical behavior of iliosacral screws (ISS) with sacroiliac hinge type fixation (SIF) following unstable pelvic ring fractures fixation. Materials and methods: A lesion simulating sacroiliac disruption and pubic disruption was created on 14 cadaver pelves. After randomization, the fractures were internally fixed using an anterior plate associated with either an ISS or an SIF. The specimens were then submitted to forces applied vertically at the coxofemoral joints. Relative movements in vertical translation and in rotation between the iliac wing and the sacrum, as well as the stiffness and the forces at failure of the assemblies were measured and compared. Results: The mean age of the bodies was 66 years (+/- 8). No significant difference was demonstrated between the groups in terms of residual motion and stiffness in both vertical and rotational displacement. The results showed a slight residual mobility in rotation of the hemipelvis. The SIFs presented greater, although non significant resistance to failure. No fixation, however, restituted stiffness comparable to a healthy pelvis. Discussion: The results of this study show that a Tile C.1.2-type injury to the pelvic ring can be treated as effectively with ISS or SIF when combined anterior and posterior fixations are performed. SIF therefore seems reliable and its continued use is justified. The long-term clinical outcomes should nevertheless be evaluated, notably on the younger population, more often affected by this type of injury.

The aim of this study was to determine which shape gives the greatest fixation stiffness. To ensure homogeneity in comparison, tests were performed on polyurethane models divided at the level of the condylar base fracture and each were fixed with 51 plates. The plates were cut from a 1 mm thick grade 23 titanium sheet. The models were then loaded and the force required for 1 mm of fracture displacement was recorded. It was noted that in addition to osteosynthesis from two simple plates, there were also two dedicated single plates with similar rigidity. Among the large number of described designs of plates, there is considerable variation in terms of the stability of the fixation performed with them. The proposed Mechanical Excellence Factor allows a pre-evaluation of the expected rigidity of fixation with a given plate shape without the need for a loading experiment. The authors expect this to be helpful for surgeons in the application of relevant plates, as well for inventors of new plates for the osteosynthesis of basal fractures in mandibular condyle.

The aim of this study was to tomographically assess the symmetry and the protrusion of the cheekbone with unstable ZMC fractures that had been treated by ORIF vs. CRWF. Materials and methods Sixty patients exhibiting a surgically unstable tetrapodal ZMC fracture were included in this multicenter retrospective study. The coordinates of 5 landmarks representing the zygomatic protrusion were comparatively studied on the healthy and on the broken side using preoperative and postoperative tridimensional computed tomography (CT) scans or cone beam CT. Results No significant difference was found in the zygomatic protrusion irrespective of the surgical technique that was used. The zygomatico-maxillary ansa was found to be the most complicated area to reduce, particularly in the frontal plane with both the CRWF and the ORIF technique (p(1) = 0.001 and p(2) = 0.0009, respectively). There was no difference in terms of the level of complications, while the mean duration of the surgery was significantly less for the CRWF group. Conclusion With good postoperative radiographic outcomes, the CRWF can be proposed as an alternative or in association with the ORIF technique for fixation of tetrapodal fractures of the ZMC.

Specimens were randomly assigned to receive either locked plate fixation (group 1) or locked plate fixation with cement augmentation (group 2). Constructs were tested for axial stiffness, load to failure, and failure mode using a material testing machine.Results: Cement-augmented specimens resisted higher loads (1936 +/- 609 N) in comparison to nonaugmented specimens (1373 +/- 590 N) (P = 0.01). In group 1, varus displacement and glenohumeral screw perforation occurred in all cases. Varus displacement occurred in 2 cases in group 2, whereas glenohumeral screw perforation did not occur in any of the cases. Cement augmentation led to a significant increase in axial stiffness (P = 0.04).Conclusions: Calcium phosphate cement-augmented locking plates enhanced fixation stability in proximal humeral fractures and reduced glenohumeral screw perforation in this 2-part cadaveric model. The ultimate advantage of this method remains to be determined in vivo.

Materials and Methods: Three different three-dimensional finite element models were created, each corresponding to three different fixation methods. The mandibles were fixed with double straight 4-hole, square 4-hole, and 5-hole Y plates. 150 N incisal occlusal loads were simulated on the distal segments. ANSYS software ((v 10; ANSYS Inc., Canonsburg, PA) was used to calculate the Von Mises stresses on fixative appliances. Results: The highest Von Mises stress values were found in Y plate. The lowest values were isolated in double straight plate group. Conclusions: It was concluded that the use of double 4-hole straight plates provided the sufficient stability on the osteotomy site when compared with the other rigid fixation methods used in this study.

Osteotomies of the distal femur were fixed with these rods (2 x 15 mm) in the rabbits. The follow-up times varied from 3 to 104 weeks. After sacrifice, three-point bending and shear tests and molecular weight measurements were performed for subcutaneously placed rods. Radiological, histological, microradiographic, oxytetracycline-fluorescence, and histomorphometrical studies of the osteotomized and intact control femora were performed. After 6 weeks the mechanical properties had decreased significantly, but osteotomies had healed uneventfully. The present investigation showed that the mechanical strength and fixation properties of SR-Polylactide-glycolide (80/20) rods are suitable for fixation of cancellous bone osteotomies in rabbits provided that the operative technique is correct. The present article is the first report on the application of these rods for fixation of cancellous bone osteotomies.	[Makela, Eeva; Makela, E.

However, the utility of these polymers for bone fixation devices is hampered due to the lack of mechanical strength. Herein we synthesized a high-strength thermoset polymer, poly(glycerol-succinate) (PGS), via a catalyst-free and solvent-free reaction. The bending strength of PGS reaches 122.01 +/- 8.82 MPa, signifying its great potential for fixation devices. The degradation property of the polymer can be tuned by adjusting the monomer ratio and reaction time. Bone screws based on the PGS polymer were successfully manufactured using a lathe. In vitro evaluation showed the PGS polymer was able to well support cell adhesion and proliferation. In vivo evaluation using a rat subcutaneous implantation model showed that the inflammatory response to the polymer was mild. After the PGS screws were implanted in the rabbit femoral condyle for 12 weeks, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histological analysis revealed that the screws achieved good osseointegration. Consequently, the polymer developed in current study can serve as internal fixation devices due to the proper mechanical strength, excellent biocompatibility, and feasibility of manufacturing screws.

Pelvic ring fixation using the S2 alar iliac screw (SAIS) without fixation of the lumbosacral vertebrae may have potential as a novel, minimally in-vasive technique for treating unstable pelvic ring fractures. The present study compared clinical outcomes in patients who underwent SAIS fixation within the pelvic ring with a historical control group of patients who underwent conventional trans-iliac plate fixation for the treatment of unstable pelvic ring fractures.Materials and methods: Thirty-two patients diagnosed with unstable pelvic fractures with sacral fracture or sacroiliac joint fracture dislocation were retrospectively evaluated. Eight consecutive patients under-went trans-iliac plate fixation from April 2012 to March 2015, and 24 consecutive patients underwent SAIS fixation from April 2015 to February 2020. Rates of soft tissue complications, intraoperative blood loss, and intraoperative blood transfusion volume were compared in these two groups.Results: Mean intraoperative blood loss was significantly lower in patients who underwent SAIS fixa-tion than in those who underwent trans-iliac plate fixation (141.0 ml vs 315.0 ml; P = 0.027), although there were no between-group differences in intraoperative blood transfusion volume (0.0 ml vs 140 ml; P = 0.105), incidence rate of soft tissue complications (4.2% vs 0%; P = 1.0 0 0), and operation time (88.5 min vs 93.0 min; P = 0.862). Bone healing was confirmed in all patients who underwent SAIS fixation without dislocation of the fracture site, whereas one patient who underwent trans-iliac plate fixation experienced a dislocation of the fracture site during follow-up (0% vs 12.5%; P = 0.250).Conclusions: SAIS fixation reduces intraoperative blood loss and ensures bone healing without major complications, including dislocation of the fracture site. SAIS fixation may therefore be an alternative, minimally invasive method of treating unstable pelvic fractures.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Surgery may be considered if conservative treatment does not work or if a quicker and more reliable return to sports is expected. Surgery is usually performed under fluoroscopic guidance based on the premise that the proper placement of the internal fixation material can be determined on radiographic images. Patient concerns: A 16-year-old female basketball player gradually became aware of pain in the anterior aspect of her right knee during basketball, without any particular history of trauma. A computed tomography scan revealed a small bone fragment on the lateral side of the distal end of the patella. Diagnosis: Stress fracture of the patella. Interventions: Since it was difficult to determine the exact location of the bone fragment on radiographs, the surgery was performed under ultrasound guidance rather than fluoroscopy. While checking the bone fragment with ultrasound images, insertion of the guide pin, drilling, and screw fixation were performed under ultrasound guidance. Outcomes: Postoperative computed tomography showed accurate screw insertion into the bone fragment. Two months after surgery, bony fusion was confirmed, and the patient returned to her preinjury level of basketball. Conclusion: Ultrasound-guided screw fixation was useful in this case in which internal fixation of fractures is difficult under fluoroscopic guidance.

Intramedullary fixation is a novel technique for treatment of distal radius fractures. The present study aimed to evaluate the functional and radiographic outcomes of intramedullary nailing for correction of post-traumatic deformity in late-diagnosed fractures of the distal radius. Materials and methods From July 2009 to February 2011, 16 patients with late-diagnosed displaced fractures of the distal radius were included. Eligible inclusion was extra-articular fracture for more than 4 weeks. Surgical correction and internal fixation with intramedullary nailing was performed for treatment of ten AO type A2 and six AO type A3 fractures. All patients were followed up radiographically and clinically for an average of 20.3 months. Results All fractures achieved bone union without major complications. Functional status and radiographic alignment significantly improved postoperatively. There was no significantly secondary displacement comparing early postoperative and final radiographic parameters. The functional results according to the Mayo wrist scoring system were good or excellent in 94 % of patients. The mean score was 83.8. Conclusion Surgical correction and internal fixation with the intramedullary nail is a feasible and less invasive technique with few complications in the treatment of posttraumatic deformity of the distal radius.

The present study was designed to study the anatomical characteristics of the distal fibula and to thereby evaluate the advantages and limitations of various operative approaches, as well as their indications for specific conditions. Ten leg specimens from below the knee joint were dissected using posterior, lateral and posterolateral approaches to the fibula. The adjacent vulnerable structures, including nerves, blood vessels, tendons and ligaments, were carefully examined and their distances from the posterior malleolus were recorded. The distance was 7.2 +/- 4.1 mm between the sural nerve and the posterior section of the fibula, 79.2 +/- 23.5 mm between the lateral malleolus tip and the point where the shape changes in the lower fibula and 66.4 +/- 17.4 mm between the lateral malleolus and the jointed tendon of the peroneal and flexor hallux longus muscles. The widest anteroposterior diameter of the distal fibula was 27.3 +/- 3.5 mm. Various approaches have certain advantages and limitations when these anatomical factors are taken into account. The choice should be based on the height of the fibular fracture line, the type of posterior malleolus fracture, the effect of the fracture on the stability of the ankle joint and the materials used for internal fixation.

Self-deploying shape memory polymer scaffolds for grafting and stabilizing complex bone defects: A mouse femoral segmental defect study	BIOMATERIALS			English	Article						Segmental defect; Mouse model; Synthetic bone graft; Internal fracture fixation; Shape memory polymer	OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM; MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; IN-VIVO; FRACTURE FIXATION; IRAQI FREEDOM; INFECTIOUS COMPLICATIONS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; COMBAT CASUALTIES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; TIBIAL FRACTURES	Treatment of complex bone defects places a significant burden on the US health care system. Current strategies for treatment include grafting and stabilization using internal metal plates/screws, intramedullary rods, or external fixators. Here, we introduce the use of shape memory polymer (SMP) materials for grafting and adjunct stabilization of segmental defects. Self-deploying SMP grafts and SMP sleeves capable of expanding and contracting, respectively, under intraoperative conditions were developed and evaluated in a mouse segmental defect model in vivo. Integration between grafts/sleeves and native bone was assessed using x-ray radiography, microcomputed tomography, and torsional mechanical testing. We found that SMP grafts were able to integrate with the native bone after 12 weeks, maintain defect stability, and provide torsional mechanical properties comparable to an allograft alone treatment; however no gross de novo bone formation was observed. SMP sleeves did not inhibit bony bridging at the margins, and limbs treated with a sleeve/allograft combination had torsional mechanical properties comparable to limbs treated with an allograft alone. In vitro torsional and bending tests suggest sleeves may provide additional torsional stability to defects. Incorporation of shape memory into synthetic bone graft substitutes and adjunct stabilization devices is anticipated to enhance functionality of synthetic materials employed in both applications.

Techniques for orbital reconstruction have migrated away from autogenous bone grafts to well-tolerated alloplasts, such as titanium and Medpor. Material for reconstructing the orbit can then be selected based on requirements of the defect matched to the mechanical properties of the material. Material selection is largely and ultimately dependent upon surgeon preference.

There have been a number of non-randomized studies comparing arthroplasty with internal fixation in patients with femoral neck fractures. However, there remains considerable debate about whether the results of non-randomized studies are consistent with the results of randomized, controlled trials. Given the economic burden of hip fractures, it remains essential to identify therapies to improve outcomes; however, whether data from non-randomized studies of an intervention should be used to guide patient care remains unclear. We aimed to determine whether the pooled results of mortality and revision surgery among non-randomized studies were similar to those of randomized trials in studies comparing arthroplasty with internal fixation in patients with femoral neck fractures. <LF>Materials and methods. We conducted a Medline search from 1969 to June 2002, identifying both randomized and non-randomized studies comparing internal fixation with arthroplasty in patients with femoral neck fractures. Additional strategies to identify relevant articles included Cochrane database, SCISEARCH, textbooks, annual meeting programs, and content experts. We abstracted information on mortality and revision rates in each study and compared the pooled results between non-randomized and randomized studies. In addition, we explored potential reasons for dissimilar results between the two study designs. Results. We identified 140 citations that addressed the general topic of comparison of arthroplasty and internal fixation for hip fracture. Of these, 27 studies met the eligibility criteria, 13 of which were non-randomized studies and 14 of which were randomized trials. Mortality data was available in all 13 non-randomized studies (n=3108 patients) and in 12 randomized studies (n=1767 patients). Non-randomized studies overestimated the risk of mortality by 40% when compared with the results of randomized trials (relative risk 1.44 vs 1.04, respectively). Information on revision risk was available in 9 non-randomized studies (n=2764 patients) and all 14 randomized studies (n=1901 patients). Both estimates from non-randomized and randomized studies revealed a significant reduction in the risk of revision surgery with arthroplasty compared with internal fixation (relative risk 0.38 vs 0.23, respectively). The reduction in the risk of revision surgery with arthroplasty compared with internal fixation was 62% for non-randomized studies and 77% for randomized trials. Thus, non-randomized studies underestimated the relative benefit of arthroplasty by 19.5%. Non-randomized studies with point estimates of relative risk similar to the pooled estimate for randomized trials all controlled for patient age, gender, and fracture displacement in their comparisons of mortality. We were unable to identify reasons for differences in the revision rate results between the study designs. Conclusions. Similar to other reports in medical subspecialties, non-randomized studies provided results dissimilar to randomized trials of arthroplasty vs internal fixation for mortality and revision rates in patients with femoral neck fractures. Investigators should be aware of these discrepancies when evaluating the merits of alternative surgical interventions, especially when both randomized trials and non-randomized comparative studies are available.

Various surgical techniques and materials can be used, and their clinical outcomes are favorable. However, soft-tissue and skin irritation, pain, and limited range of motion due to metallic hardware can occur, and removal of hardware such as screws and K-wire may be required after bony union. We present a vertical interfragmentary suture technique for patella fractures using sequential compressive tightening with the Nice knot. This knot-tying technique is low profile, provides stable fixation enough to hold displaced fractures, and does not require a secondary procedure for hardware removal.

Biomechanical Stability of Intramedullary Technique for Fixation of Joint Depressed Calcaneus Fracture	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Calcaneus; Intra-articular; Headless compression screw; Fracture	INTERNAL-FIXATION; INTRAARTICULAR FRACTURES; PERCUTANEOUS TREATMENT	Background: Internal fixation of the os calcis is often complicated by prolonged soft tissue management and posterior facet disruption. An ideal calcaneal construct would include minimal hardware prominence, sturdy posterior facet fixation and nominal soft tissue disruption. The purpose of this study was to develop such a construct and provide a biomechanical analysis comparing our technique to a standard internal fixation technique. Methods and Materials: Twenty fresh-frozen cadaver calcanei were used to create a reproducible Sanders type-IIB calcaneal fracture pattern. One calcaneus of each pair was randomly selected to be fixed using our compressive headless screw technique. The contralateral matched calcaneus was fixed with a nonlocking calcaneal plate in it traditional fashion. Each calcaneus was cyclically loaded at a frequency of 1 Hz for 4000 cycles using an increasing force from 250 N to 1000 N. An Opto-trak motion capturing system was used to detect relative motion of the three fracture fragments at eight different points along the fracture lines. Horizontal separation and vertical displacement at the fracture lines was recorded, as well as relative rotation at the primary fracture line. Results: When the data were averaged, there was more horizontal displacement at the primary fracture line of the plate and screw construct compared to the headless screw construct. The headless screw construct also had less vertical displacement at the primary fracture line at every load. On average those fractures fixed with the headless screw technique had less rotation than those fixed with the side plate technique. Conclusion: A new headless screw technique for calcaneus fracture fixation was shown to provide stability as good as, or better than, a standard side plating technique tinder the axial loading conditions of our model. Although further testing is needed, the stability of the proposed technique is similar to that typically provided by intramedullary fixation. Clinical Relevance: This fixation technique provides a biomechanically stable construct with the potential for a minimally invasive approach and improved post-operative soft tissue healing.

Internal fixation using titanium plates and screws is the most common method of stabilization. These have the potential for interference with radiotherapy delivery. This in vitro study compares the strength of titanium and resorbable internal fixation in a mandibulotomy model by analyzing the force required for plate and screw breakage. Materials and Methods: Red oak wood board was used to simulate the mandible. Titanium and resorbable plates and screws in various configurations were used to stabilize pieces of the wood. They were arranged in 6 different groups. The specimens were individually tested with a vertical load, while the test machine recorded the force-versus-displacement behavior automatically. Results: Plate type and configuration affected the applied load required to induce displacement of the simulated mandibulotomy. Heating and cooling the resorbable plates prior to strength testing also affected the load-versus-displacement curve. Conclusions: overall, the titanium system we studied exhibited greater resistance to deformation from a vertical load than did the resorbable plate groups.

Materials and Methods: From May 2012 to August 2013, six consecutive patients (three men and three women; median age, 58.33 y +/- 21.45; age range, 18-78 y) who underwent percutaneous cementoplasty plus interventional internal fixation for the treatment of metastases to the proximal femur were retrospectively analyzed. The Karnofsky performance status (KPS) and visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain were assessed before and 1 week after the procedure; moreover, the procedure duration, length of hospital stay, risk of fracture at the procedural site, and complications were assessed. Results: The KPS increased from 66.67 +/- 12.11 (range, 60-90) before the procedure to 76.67 +/- 13.66 (range, 60-100) 1 week after the procedure. For symptomatic patients (n = 5), the VAS score decreased from 6.80 +/- 2.39 (range, 3-9) before the procedure to 1.80 +/- 0.84 (range, 1-3) at 1 week after the procedure. The mean procedure duration was 90.00 minutes +/- 10.56 (range, 72-102 min). The average length of hospital stay was 7 days +/- 2 (range, 4-10 d). The only complication noted consisted of thrombophlebitis in one patient, on the operative side, at 15 days after the procedure. No cases of procedural site fracture during follow-up were noted (median, 192 d; range, 30-365 d). Conclusions: Percutaneous cementoplasty plus interventional internal fixation is a feasible technique for stabilization of impending pathologic fracture of the femur.

Internal fixation of osteopenic acetabular fractures involving the quadrilateral plate	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Internal fixation; Osteopenic; Acetabular fractures; Modified Stoppa approach	TOTAL HIP-ARTHROPLASTY; ILIOINGUINAL APPROACH; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; STOPPA APPROACH; POSTERIOR WALL; CLASSIFICATION; REPLACEMENT; REDUCTION; FAILURE	Background: Older patients tend to have acetabular fractures with medial displacement patterns and associated comminution, particularly of the quadrilateral surface. Our goal was to investigate the appropriateness of open reduction and internal fixation using an infra-pectineal buttress plate for osteopenic acetabular fractures. Materials and method: We conducted a retrospective review involving twenty one consecutive patients over the course of 4 years with an acetabular fracture in an academic level 1 trauma centre. We performed the modified Stoppa approach with buttress plating of the quadrilateral surface. Clinical examination radiographs was done using criteria described by Matta. Functional outcome was evaluated using surveys including SF-12, WOMAC, Harris Hip score and modified Postel Merle D'Aubigne. Results: Average follow-up was 4.2 years with a minimum of 2 years. Mean age for patients was 64.3 years. We obtained anatomic reduction in 52.4% (11/21) of cases, imperfect reduction in 38.1% (8/21) of cases and poor reduction in 9.5% (2/21) of cases. Significant loss of reduction was seen in 2 patients. A superior dome impaction (a Gull sign) was correlated to arthroplasty (p = 0.02) and reduced quality of initial reduction (p = 0.02). Two patients required re-intervention with a total hip arthroplasty. There was one traumatic injury to the obturator nerve and 2 patients were noted to have temporary weakness of the hip adductors postoperatively. Conclusion: Internal fixation using the modified Stoppa approach to buttress the quadrilateral plate should be considered a viable alternative to total hip arthroplasty for the initial treatment of acetabular fractures in the elderly.

Does the surgeon's experience have an impact on outcomes?	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PLATE FIXATION; PHILOS PLATE; COMPLICATIONS; STRATEGIES; QUALITY	Introduction To evaluate outcomes following open reduction and internal fixation of displaced proximal humeral fractures with regards to the surgeon's experience. Material and methods Patients were included undergoing ORIF by use of locking plates for displaced two-part surgical neck type proximal humeral fractures. Reduction and functional outcomes were compared between procedures that were conducted by trauma surgeons [TS], senior (>2 years after board certified) trauma surgeons [STS] and trauma surgeons performing >= 50 shoulder surgeries per year [SS]. Quality of reduction was measured on postoperative x-rays. Functional outcomes were assessed by gender- and age-related Constant Score (nCS). Secondary outcome measures were complication and revision rates. Results Between 2002-2014 (12.5 years) n = 278 two-part surgical neck type humeral fractures (AO 11-A2, 11-A3) were included. Open reduction and internal fixation was performed with the following educational levels: [TS](n = 68, 25.7%), [STS](n = 110, 41.5%) and [SS](n = 77, 29.1%). Functional outcome (nCS) increased with each higher level of experience and was significantly superior in [SS] (93.3) vs. [TS] (79.6; p = 0.01) vs. [STS] (83.0; p = 0.05). [SS] (7.8%) had significantly less complications compared with [TS] (11.3%; p = 0.003) and [STS](11.7%; p = 0.01) moreover significantly less revision rates (3.9%) vs. [TS](8.2%) and [STS](7.4%) (p<0.001). Primary revision was necessary in 13 cases (4.7%) due to malreduction of the fracture. Conclusion Quality of reduction and functional outcomes following open reduction and internal fixation of displaced two-part surgical neck fractures are related to the surgeon's experience. In addition, complications and revision rates are less frequent if surgery is conducted by a trauma surgeon performing >= 50 shoulder surgeries per year.

During a 6-month period, 36 tomographic examinations of the cervical spine region that provided visualization of the odontoid process were selected. Group 1 included children between 6 and 9 years of age, and group 2 contained children from 9 to 12 years of age. There were 23 (63.8%) male patients and 13 (36.2%) female patients. Patients diagnosed with a tumor, an infection, fracture non-union, or congenital malformation were excluded. Exams were ordered as part of a protocol applied to non-specific neck pain and pediatric trauma entries. The following parameters were analyzed: (1) screw attack angle, (2) height of the odontoid process, and (3) minimal transverse diameter of the odontoid process. In Groups 1 and 2, the average values of the screw attack angle were 55.9A degrees A +/- 2.3A degrees and 54.8A degrees A +/- 4.5A degrees, respectively; the average heights of the odontoid process were 26.58 +/- 3.28 and 29.48 +/- 3 mm, respectively, and the average minimal transverse diameter of the odontoid process were 6.57 +/- 1.08 and 6.23 +/- 0.88 mm, respectively. The minimal transverse diameter of the odontoid process was statistically higher in males than that in females, regardless of age (p = 0.007). In both groups, the minimal transverse diameter of the odontoid process allowed for the use of one 3.5-4.5 mm screw for anterior internal fixation.

The purposes of this study were to compare (1) reoperation rate, (2) mortality and (3) the postoperative change of walking ability between patients undergoing internal fixation (IF) and those undergoing bipolar hemiarthroplasty (HA) due to this type of fracture based on the data from the Korean Hip Fracture Registry. Materials and methods Between July 2014 and June 2016, we extracted 623 unstable intertrochanteric fractures (616 patients aged >= 65 years) according to the classification of the Association for the Study of Internal Fixation-American Orthopaedic Trauma Association. Among the 564 patients, 396 were treated with IF (IF group) and 168 with bipolar HA (HA group). We compared the reoperation rate and mortality between IF group and HA group. In patients, who were followed up more than 2 years after the surgery, we compared the postoperative change of walking activity from ambulatory outdoors (Koval's grade 1, 2, 3) to housebound (Koval's grade 4, 5, 6). Results The rate of reoperation was higher in the IF group (24/396, 6.1%) than in the HA (4/168, 2.4%) (p = 0.046). At the final follow-up, 79 (35.7%) of the 221 IF patients became housebound, whereas 21 (23.3%) of the 90 HA patients became housebound (p = 0.022). Conclusion This study showed HA was associated with lower rate of reoperation and lower decrement rate of walking ability compared to IF in elderly patients with unstable intertrochanteric fractures.

Over the past 30 years, the time from debridement to grafting has diminished from several months to a few weeks. We present our experience with a treatment model managing clinically infected fractures of the mandible with antibiotics, debridement, rigid internal fixation, and immediate autogenous bone grafting. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, we present a series of 43 patients who demonstrated clinical/laboratory findings consistent with infection in one or more mandibular fractures (50 infected fractures). These patients underwent a combination of incision and drainage, fracture debridement, rigid internal fixation, and immediate bone grafting of the resulting defect in a single stage. Both transoral and transfacial approaches were used. Results: of the 50 fractures, 43 showed both resolution of infection and bony union of fractures with long-term follow-up of 2 months to 4 years. Four fractures developed recurrent infection but proved to have bony union and were successfully treated by hardware removal only. Three other patients were deemed failures with persistent infection, loss of graft, nonunion, and need for retreatment. Each of these patients was afflicted with underlying immunocompromise. Conclusions: Although careful patient selection is a must, immediate bone grafting of infected mandibular fractures, when used in conjunction with rigid internal fixation and appropriate intraoperative debridement, is an effective treatment modality which allows a single surgical procedure and dramatically shortens the course of treatment.

Material and Methods: A prospective, randomized controlled trial was undertaken at Wits Oral Health Centre. Patients with mandibular fractures who were managed with open reduction and internal fixation using miniplates were randomized into 2 groups. The control group, the perioperative antibiotic (POA) group, was composed of patients who received intravenous (IV) antibiotic cover intraoperatively and a further 3 IV doses 24 hours postoperatively. The study group, the extended postoperative antibiotic (EPOA), was composed of patients who received similar doses as the control group but with an additional 5 days of oral antibiotics upon discharge. The patients were then evaluated for evidence of infection 1, 4, and 6 weeks postoperatively. Results: A total of 77 patients were included in the study, 41 in the POA and 36 in the EPOA groups. Fourteen patients had evidence of infection noted within the 6-week follow-up period (10 in the POA and 4 in the EPOA groups). Statistical analysis with the Pearson Chi-square and Student t test showed no statistically significant difference (P=0.399) between POA and EPOA groups. There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to site and etiology of fracture, duration of operation, and presence of infection (P>0.05) during the 6-week review period. Conclusions: The extended use of antibiotic prophylaxis when managing mandibular fractures with open reduction and internal fixation offers no additional benefit in reducing postoperative infections.

Both functional outcome and long term physiological effects of plate retention have not been clearly addressed and no specific indications regarding implant removal have been proposed in the literature. Materials and methods We reviewed 74 patients (18 females and 56 males), with an average age of 40.6 (16-75) years, who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the pubic symphysis. Except from the demographic data many other parameters like suprapubic pain, sexual disturbance, impotence and dyspareunia were taken under consideration. Furthermore, any correlation between implant failure and functional impairment was recorded and the subject of implant removal in pregnant women was examined. Health outcome was assessed according to EuroQol 5-D (EQ-5D) questionnaire. Mean follow up: 41.7 (28-89) months. Results Suprapubic pain was present in ten patients. Three men developed neurogenic impotence and one woman had deep dyspareunia. None of these symptoms were related to implant status. Three of the four females who had uncomplicated pregnancy in the post-stabilization period had the plate in situ. Implant failure was seen in four patients but they remained asymptomatic. EQ-5D questionnaire revealed high satisfaction scores among young women and men of all age groups. Conclusion This study supports the view that routine removal of the plate is not essential. The issue of whether the implant needs to be removed in women of childbearing age requires further investigation.

Although Tranexamic acid (TXA) infusion effectively reduces perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirements in elective orthopedic surgery, its efficacy in major orthopedic trauma surgery is controversial. Material and methods: Sixty-three patients undergoing open reduction and internal fixation of acetabular fracture were randomized into either TXA ( n = 36) or placebo ( n = 27) group. TXA group received a bolus dose of TXA (10 mg/kg) 15 min prior to incision, followed by another similar dose after 3 h of surgery. The placebo group received the same volume of normal saline similarly. All patients were operated on by a single pelviacetabular surgeon with a uniform perioperative protocol. The intraoperative blood loss, drain output, the number of blood transfusions, postoperative hemoglobin (Hb) drop, and hematocrit Results: Both groups were similar in relation to age, sex, BMI, preoperative Hb, the timing of surgery, fracture pattern, operative time, and surgical approaches. The mean postoperative Hb was 10.35 +/- 1.36 gm% in TXA group and 9.74 +/- 1.98 gm% in placebo group (p-value 0.158). There were no differences in intraoperative blood loss (438.11 ml vs. 442.81, p = .947), drain output (131.94 ml vs. 129.63, p = .870), and blood transfusion (8 patients vs. five patients, p = .719) between the groups. The drop in Hb and Hct in the postoperative period was also statistically not significant between the groups. Conclusion: There is no significant reduction in blood loss and blood transfusion with the use of intravenous Tranexamic acid in open reduction and internal fixation of acetabular fractures.

Methods: Two FE models of the intact pelvis were constructed: the literature-based model (LBM) with bone material properties taken from the literature, and the patient-specific model (PSM) with QCT-derived bone material properties. Unilateral transforaminal sacral fracture was modelled to assess different fixation techniques: iliosacral screw (ISS) at the first sacral vertebra (S1) (ISS1), ISS at the second sacral vertebra (S2) (ISS2), ISS at S1 and S2 (ISS12), transverse iliosacral screws (TISS) at S1 (TISS1), TISS at S2 (TISS2), and TISS at S1 and S2 (TISS12). A 600 N vertical load with both acetabula fixed was applied. Vertical stiffness (VS), relative interfragmentary displacement (RID), and the von Mises stress values in the screws and fracture interface were analysed. Results: The lowest and highest normalised VS was given by ISS1 and TISS12 techniques for LBM and PSM, with 137 % and 149 %, and 375 % and 472 %, respectively. In comparison with the LBM, the patient-specific bone modelling increased the maximum screw stress values by 19.3, 16.3, 27.8, 2.3, 24.4 and 7.8 % for ISS1, ISS2, ISS12, TISS1, TISS2 and TISS12, respectively. The maximum RID values were between 0.10 mm and 0.47 mm for all fixation techniques in both models. The maximum von Mises stress results on the fracture interface show a substantial difference between the two models, as PSM (mean +/- SD of 15.76 +/- 8.26 MPa) gave lower stress values for all fixation techniques than LBM (mean +/- SD of 28.95 +/- 6.91 MPa). Conclusion: The differences in stress distribution underline the importance of considering locally defined bone material properties when investigating internal mechanical parameters. Based on the results, all techniques demonstrated clinically sufficient stability, with TISS12 being superior from a biomechanical standpoint. Both LBM and PSM models indicated a consistent trend in ranking the fixation techniques based on stability. However, long-term clinical trials are recommended to confirm the findings of the study.

From January 2008 to December 2009, 16 children with similar fractures and ages were grouped according to the fixation material used. Children were seen at 3, 6, and 12 months and more than 4 years (mean 51.8 months) postoperatively. The clinical results were compared using the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS). Radiographic studies of the fractured and opposite elbow were assessed at last follow-up control. Twelve children had a sufficient followup and could be included in the study. Seven could be included in the traditional group and 5 in the bioabsorbable group. At 12 months, the MEPS was 100 for every child in both groups. Asymptomatic bony radiolucent visible tracks and heterotopic ossifications were noted in both groups. There were no significant differences in terms of clinical and radiological outcome between the two groups.

Tea polyphenols have antibacterial properties. Bacteriocins produced by probiotic lactobacilli can inhibit Gram-positive bacteria. This study used a rabbit model of infection, following femoral fracture with internal fixation, to evaluate the efficacy of the combined use of tea polyphenols and Lactobacillus plantarum ST8SH bacteriocin. Material/Methods: Twenty-four New Zealand White rabbits underwent femoral fracture, internal fixation, and insertion of a mini- titanium implant, and were inoculated intravenously with suspensions of Staphylococcal bacteria. Four treatment groups included group A, injected with tea polyphenols and bacteriocins (N=6); group B, injected with cefradine and bacteriocins (N=6); group C, injected with tea polyphenols and cefradine (N=6); and group D (controls), injected with saline (N=6). Blood samples were collected at 1, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after the injection of bacteriocins. Biofilms that formed on the mini-titanium implant were studied by fluorescence microscopy. Serum levels of level of interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The combination of tea polyphenols and bacteriocins (group A) had a significant inhibitory effect on Staphylococcus aureus (P<0.05) and significant differences in serum levels of IL-8, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 levels in serum (P<0.05) when compared with groups, B, C, and D. Conclusions: In a rabbit model of femoral fracture with internal fixation, the combined use of tea polyphenols and Lactobacillus plantarum ST8SH bacteriocin effectively controlled Staphylococcus aureus infection.

J	Campbell, ST; Taylor, M; Dunbar, RP; Firoozabadi, R				Campbell, Sean T.; Taylor, Mario; Dunbar, Robert P.; Firoozabadi, Reza			Long-term sequelae of septic arthritis after tibial plateau fracture fixation: does timing matter?	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Tibial plateau fracture; Septic arthritis; Deep infection	INFECTION	Introduction Septic arthritis following surgical treatment of a tibial plateau fracture is a rare complication, but it does occur, and the impact on long-term function is relatively unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the long-term sequelae of septic arthritis among patients treated with internal fixation for a tibial plateau fracture and to determine the effect of timing (early or late infection) on the rate of such sequela. Materials and methods A retrospective comparative study was designed using the trauma database of a single level I academic trauma center. Patients who developed culture-positive septic knee arthritis after internal fixation of a tibial plateau fracture, with 1-year follow-up, were included in the study. The number of debridement procedures required was recorded. Rates of long-term complications and implant removal were identified. Complications rates were compared between patients who developed early (within 30 days of definitive fixation) and late (more than 30 days) septic arthritis. Results The mean number of debridement procedures per patient was six. Fourteen patients (88%) required implant removal, and thirteen (81%) developed knee arthritis. There was a significantly lower rate of complications in the early septic arthritis group compared to the late group (3 of 6 patients or 50%, vs 10 of 10 patients or 100%; p = 0.036). Conclusions Patients who developed septic arthritis following internal fixation of a tibial plateau fracture were likely to endure long-term sequelae. Early infection and detection led to fewer complications. Surgeons treating infectious complications in tibial plateau fracture patients should specifically seek to rule out septic arthritis, anticipate that implant removal may be necessary, and counsel these patients appropriately regarding the anticipated natural history of their condition.

The current standard material used is a metal plate that is implanted onto the bone. However, metal fixation devices have many disadvantages, namely stress shielding and metal ion leaching. This study aims to fix these problems of metal implants by making a completely biodegradable material that will have a high modulus and exhibit great toughness. To accomplish this, long-fiber poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) was utilized in combination with a matrix composed of polycaprolactone (PCL) and hydroxyapatite (HA) nano-rods. Through single fibril tensile tests, it was found that the PLLA fibers have a Young's modulus of 8.09 GPa. Synthesized HA nanorods have dimensions in the nanometer range with an aspect ratio over 6. By dip coating PLLA fibers in a suspension of PCL and HA and hot pressing the resulting coated fibers, dense fiber-reinforced samples were made having a flexural modulus up to 9.2 GPa and a flexural strength up to 187 MPa. The flexural modulus of cortical bone ranges from 7 to 25 GPa, so the modulus of the composite material falls into the range of bone. The typical flextural strength of bone is 130 MPa, and the samples here greatly exceed that with a strength of 187 MPa. After mechanical testing to failure the samples retained their shape, showing toughness with no catastrophic failure, indicating the possibility for use as a fixation material.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the radiographic and functional results of Vancouver B3 PFF treated by revision total hip or hemiarthroplasty (HA) in combination with appropriate internal fixation without bone grafting. Materials and Methods: 12 patients with Vancouver B3 PFF were treated by revision THA/HA without bone grafting between March 2004 and May 2008. There were nine females and three males, with an average age of 76 years. PFFs were following primary THA/HA in nine patients and following revision THA/HA in three. Postoperative followup was 5.5 years on average (range, 3.5-6.5 years). At the final followup, radiographic results were evaluated with Beals and Tower's criteria and functional outcomes were evaluated using the Merle d'Aubigne scoring system. Results: All fractures healed within an average of 20 weeks (range, 12-28 weeks). There was no significant deformity and shortening of the affected limb and the implant was stable. The average Merle d'Aubigne score was 15.8. Walking ability was regained in 10 patients without additional assistance, while 2 patients had to use crutches. There were 2 patients with numbness of lateral thigh, possibly due to injury to the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. There were no implant failures, dislocation and refractures. Conclusions: Revision THA/HA in combination with appropriate internal fixation without bone grafting is a good option for treatment of Vancouver B3 periprosthetic femoral fractures in the elderly.

This is an observational prospective study. Three hundred eighteen patients were operated on for mandibular fractures. The patients were divided into two groups according to the type of surgical technique used: modified lag screws (155 patients) and traditional miniplates (163 patients). Analyses were made of sociodemographic and preoperative variables, the parameters related to the fracture type and postoperative data. There were no differences between the two groups regarding their sociodemographic characteristics. The modified lag screws were primarily used with double fractures, while conventional miniplates were more often used with simple fractures. The number of complications was higher with the miniplate technique. The unfavorable fractures had an OR of 5.75 due to postoperative complications; double fractures had an OR of 8.87 and simple fractures an OR of 19.53, which, in both cases, were lower with conventional miniplates than with modified lag screws. Modified lag screws provide a rigid fixation system that is as secure as miniplates, but with greater compression between the fragments, less postsurgical gap, faster ossification, and fewer postoperative complications. The modified screw technique is a safe tool that does not require any specific osteosynthesis materials not found in a basic traumatology kit and has a lower cost, due to the reduced amount of material used.

The main aim of the present study was to assess the correlation between radiographic Remaining Attachment Index (RAI) and risk of implant loosening at last follow-up following internal fixation of Vancouver B1 periprosthetic hip fracture. Material and method: A multicentre retrospective study included 50 patients with Vancouver B1 periprosthetic hip fracture with uncemented femoral stem between 2013 and 2019. Preoperative radiographs were analysed independently by 2 senior orthopedic surgeons, distinguishing 2 groups: RAI > 2/3 versus < 2/3. Postoperative and last follow-up radiographs were then screened for signs of complete femoral component loosening. Results: Median age was 89 years (range: 36-99 years). Two RAI > 2/3 patients showed implant loosening (8%) versus 9 RAI < 2/3 patients (36%), disclosing a significant correlation between early loosening and RAI < 2/3 (p = 0.005). Interobserver agreement for both radiographic RAI and radiographic loosening assessment at last follow-up was 98% with kappa correlation coefficient 0.96 [range: 0.88-1]. Conclusion: Remaining Attachment Index < 2/3 in Vancouver B1 periprosthetic hip fracture was a risk factor for early implant loosening after isolated internal fixation. In these often frail elderly patients, first-line implant exchange is to be considered in the light of the risk/benefit ratio. The present results confirm the need for rigorous preoperative radiographic work-up of the remaining attachment area in Vancouver B1 fracture. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Materials and Methods: Literature research was done in databases such as PubMed, Ovid, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar Beta. From the original 488 articles identified, 14 articles were finally included. Only 5 studies were prospective and 9 retrospective. The range of postoperative study records was from 6 weeks to 12.7 years. Results: The horizontal short-term relapse was between 9.9% and 62.1% at point Band between 15.7% and 91.3% at pogonion. Long-term relapse was between 14.9% and 28.0% at point B and between 11.5% and 25.4% at pogonion. Conclusions: Neither large increase nor decrease of relapse was seen when short-term values were compared with long-term. Bilateral sagittal split osteotomy for mandibular setback in combination with orthodontics is an effective treatment of skeletal Class III and a stable procedure in the short- and long-term. The etiology of relapse is multifactorial: the proper seating of the condyles, the amount of setback, the soft tissue and muscles, remaining growth and remodeling, and gender were identified. Age did not show any correlations. To obtain reliable scientific evidence, further short- and long-term research of bilateral sagittal split osteotomy setback with rigid internal fixation should exclude additional surgery, ie, genioplasty or maxillary surgery, and include correlation statistics.

Open reduction and internal fixation of clavicular nonunions with allograft bone substitute	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SHOULDER SURGERY			English	Article						Allograft bone substitute; clavicle nonunion; iliac crest bone graft; open reduction and internal fixation	PLATELET-RICH PLASMA; OPERATIVE TREATMENT; COMPLICATIONS; MIDSHAFT; GRAFT; FRACTURES; MATRIX; FUSION; PIN	Background: Biologic augmentation with allograft has shown equivalent healing rates to autograft in several nonunion models. No literature exists clearly demonstrating this in the clavicle. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the healing and complication rates of clavicle nonunions treated solely with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and allograft. Materials and Methods: Nineteen clavicle nonunions treated with ORIF and allograft were evaluated retrospectively to assess healing rates and complications based on clinical symptoms and radiographic findings. Results: For the 19 patients included and treated with ORIF and allograft, clinical follow-up averaged 15 months. Seven patients were smokers. Although complete radiographic healing was achieved in only 68% of patients, clinical success occurred in 16 (84%) patients who demonstrated full range of motion and strength without pain. The three patients who did not demonstrate full radiographic healing were completely pain free. Five patients experienced complications (26%). Two underwent hardware removal due to persistent irritation after union. Three had a persistent painful nonunion. Each of these three patients was a smoker (P=0.08). Two proceeded to union after revision fixation. The other had hardware failure, which was removed, with a persistent nonunion and did not wish any further treatment. Conclusion: ORIF with allograft bone substitute is an acceptable treatment alternative to iliac crest bone graft for clavicle nonunions. However, we did not demonstrate equivalent healing rates to published results utilizing autograft. Smokers were identified to have a trend toward higher failure rates with ORIF augmented with allograft and therefore these patients may be better served by augmenting fixation with autograft.

Minimally invasive anterior pelvic internal fixation: An anatomic study comparing Pelvic Bridge to INFIX	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Anterior pelvic internal fixation; Anatomic; Pelvic Bridge; INFIX; Subcutaneous; Pelvic ring; Cadaver; Inguinal ligament	RING; SERIES	Objectives: Anterior external fixation for pelvic ring fractures has shown to effectively improve stability and reduce mortality. However, these fixators can be associated with substantial morbidity such as pin tract infection, premature loss of fixation, and decreased quality of life in patients. Recently, two new methods of subcutaneous anterior pelvic internal fixation have been developed; the INFIX and the Pelvic Bridge. These methods have the purported advantages of lower wound complications, less surgical site pain, and improved quality of life. We sought to investigate the measured distances to critical anatomic structures, as well as the qualitative and topographic differences notable during implantation of both devices in the same cadaveric specimen. Materials and methods: The Pelvic Bridge and INFIX were implanted in eleven fresh cadavers. Distances were then measured to: the superficial inguinal ring, round ligament, spermatic cord, lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN), femoral nerve, femoral artery, and femoral vein. Observations regarding implantation and topography were also recorded. Results: The INFIX had greater measured distances from all structures except for the LFCN, in which its proximity placed this structure at risk. Neither device appears to put other critical structures at risk in the supine position. Significant implantation and topographic differences exist between the devices. The INFIX application lacked "safety margins" concerning the LFCN in 10/11 (90.9%) specimens, while Pelvic Bridge placement lacked "safety margins" with regard to the right superficial ring (1/11, 9%) and the right spermatic cord (1/11, 9%). Conclusions: Both the Pelvic Bridge and INFIX lie at safe distances from most critical pelvic structures in the supine position, though INFIX application places the LFCN at risk.

BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS			English	Article						Homemade hook plate; Internal fixation; PCL tibial avulsion	SUTURE FIXATION; POSTEROMEDIAL APPROACH; INJURIES; ATTACHMENT	Objective To compare the clinical results of homemade hook plates and hollow lag screws combined with spacers in the treatment of posterior cruciate tibial ligament avulsion fractures. Materials and methods This was a retrospective clinical cohort study that included 64 patients with PCL tibial avulsion fractures. Thirty-two of them were fixed with a homemade hook plate (hook plate group), and 32 were fixed with a hollow lag screen combined with a gasket (hollow lag screen group). By reviewing the medical record data and follow-up results, the operation time, postoperative drainage, fracture healing time, surgical complications, knee mobility, recovery of joint function, and whether postoperative gastrocnemius muscle strength changed in the two groups were compared. Results All patients had successful wound and fracture healing. No adverse events, such as bone nonunion, infection, wound haematoma, or joint stiffness, occurred in either group. There were no patients with decreased gastrocnemius muscle strength in either group. Internal fixation failure occurred in 2 cases in the hollow lag screen group but not in the hook plate group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of operative time, postoperative drainage, fracture healing time, knee mobility at the last follow-up, or Lysholm score. Conclusion It is safe and effective to use a homemade hook plate to fix PCL tibial avulsion fractures through an inverted L-shaped posterior medial approach. A homemade hook plate may have potential advantages over a hollow lag screen combined with gasket fixation.

Analysis of risk factors of the postoperative complications of surgical treatment of ankle fractures in the elderly: A series of 477 patients	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Ankle injuries; Elderly; Risk factors; Surgical treatment; Postoperative complications	OPERATIVE FIXATION; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; INFECTION	Introdution: The surgical strategy of ankle fractures in elderly subjects is controversial because of the high rate of local and general complications. The goal of this study was to identify the risk factors of complications of ankle fractures in elderly subjects. Materials and methods: Four hundred and seventy-seven patients operated between 2008 and 2014 were included in this retrospective study. The minimum age was 60 years old for women and 70 for men. Patients presenting with a pilon fracture or with less than 3 months of follow up were excluded. A clinical evaluation of autonomy based on the Parker score and a radiographic assessment were performed preoperatively and during follow up The characteristics of the fracture, comorbidities and the type of internal fixation used were reported. Results: This series included 384 women (81%), mean age 74 years old (60-99). Most fractures were Weber type B (n=336). Four hundred and thirty-one patients (90.4%) received so-called standard internal fixation and 46 patients (9.6%) received so-called atypical fixation. The rate of general complications was 4.6%, and local complications was 23.9%. Univariate analysis of the risk factors of general complications identified 2 significant criteria: age older than 80 (OR=3.46, P=0.012) and more than 2 comorbidities 2 (OR=10.6, P<0.0001). Univariate analysis of risk factors of local complications identified 2 criteria: an open fracture (OR=4.90, P=0.0016) and age over 80 (OR=1.85, P=0.024). Multivariate analysis of risk factors of local complications confirmed the relationship with open fractures (OR=4.67, P<0.001). Discussion: The results of the management of ankle fractures in elderly subjects is satisfactory. The use of standard internal fixation techniques is recommended. The risk of complications increases with age, the severity of the fracture and the number of associated diseases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this study was to identify union, complication, and patient satisfaction rates of ankle fusions performed at our institution, using the plane between extensor hallucis longus and tibialis anterior with medial tibiotalar screw internal fixation. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review was performed of all isolated primary fusions between 2005 and 2009. Eighty-two ankles were identified in 73 patients. All patient records were reviewed, and 57 patients (65 ankles) attended for clinical evaluation and scoring. Age range at surgery was 18 to 75 years (mean, 56.1 years); 8 patients were smokers. Diagnoses were trauma in 52 patients (63%), osteoarthritis in 17, rheumatoid arthritis in 7, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in 3, congenital talipes equinovarus in 2, and talar avascular necrosis in 1. Follow-up range was 7 months to 8.3 years (mean, 4 years). Results: Time to union ranged from 8 to 39 weeks (mean, 13.3) with a union rate of 100%. The AOFAS range was 12 to 93 (mean, 70). Eighty percent were "very satisfied"or "satisfied."Major complication rate was 14.6%: 7 malalignments; 3 wound problems; 2 complex regional pain syndrome; and 2 delayed unions, both smokers. Conclusions: An excellent union rate, high patient satisfaction, and low complication rate were achieved with this technique. Varus malalignment and persistent pain resulted in dissatisfaction. Many patients remained highly active, and bilaterally fused patients functioned as well as unilateral ones. Level of Evidence: Level IV, retrospective case series.

Sample Population-14 forelimbs from cadavers of 3-year-old Thoroughbreds. Procedures-Allogeneic cortical bone fragments were collected from the limbs of a male Thoroughbred, and cortical bone screws were prepared from the tissue by use of a precision desktop microlathe programmed with the dimensions of a metal cortical bone screw. A midbody transverse osteotomy of each PSB was performed by use of a bone-shaping oscillating saw and repaired via 1 of 3 internal fixation techniques: 1 allogeneic bone screw with 1 allogeneic bone pin (type I; n = 6 PSBs), 2 allogeneic bone screws (type II; 8), or 1 stainless steel cortical bone screw (control repair; 6). Mechanical tension measurements were obtained by use of a commercially available materials testing system. Results-Mean +/- SD tensile strength (TS) was 668.3 +/- 216.6 N for type (repairs, 854.4 +/- 253.2 N for type II repairs, and 1,150.0 +/- 451.7 N for control repairs. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Internal fixation of PSB fractures by the use of allogeneic bone screws and bone pins was successful. Although mean TS of control repairs with stainless steel cortical bone screws was greater than the mean TS of type I and type ((repairs, the difference between type II and control repairs was not significant. Allogeneic screws may advance healing and result in fewer complications in a clinical setting.

This study aimed to develop a new internal fixator absorbable scaphoid screw (ASS) for fixation of the scaphoid waist after fracture and to test the biomechanical characteristics of ASS. Materials and methods: An ASS was prepared using polylactic acids and designed based on scaphoid measurements and anatomic features. Twenty fractured scaphoid waist specimens were randomly divided into experimental and control groups (n=10/group). Reduction and internal fixation of the scaphoid were achieved with either Kirschner wires (K-wires) or ASS. A moving target simulator was used to test palmar flexion and dorsal extension, with the range of testing (waist movement) set from 5 degrees of palmar flexion to 25 degrees of dorsal extension. Flexion and extension were repeated 2,000 times for each specimen. Fracture gap displacements were measured with a computerized tomography scanning. Scaphoid tensile and bending strengths were measured by using a hydraulic pressure biomechanical system. Results: Prior to biomechanical fatigue testing, fracture gap displacements were 0.16 +/- 0.02 mm and 0.22 +/- 0.02 mm in the ASS and K-wire groups, respectively. After fatigue testing, fracture gap displacements in the ASS and the K-wire groups were 0.21 +/- 0.03 mm and 1.52 +/- 0.07 mm, respectively. The tensile strengths for the ASS and K-wire groups were 0.95 +/- 0.02 MPa and 0.63 +/- 0.02 MPa, respectively. Conclusion: Fixation using an ASS provided sufficient mechanical support for the scaphoid after fracture.

Materials and Methods: A model of the mandible was prepared using computed tomography (CT) scans. The CT scans were transferred and converted to the finite element model by means of a procedure developed for this study. Simulated corpus fractures were fixed with 14 different fixation configurations of titanium miniplates. The FEA was performed with respect to displacement and stresses in the titanium miniplates for these configurations. Results: The study results indicated that the use of 2 straight miniplates is more rigid than other fixation types. Fixation with only I miniplate at the inferior location resulted in mobility greater than the set limit of 150 mu m. With "L" and "T" shaped miniplates and a straight miniplate at the middle location, fracture mobility was approximately equal to or less than the limit; however, displacement nearly reached to limit. Superior fixations with only 1 miniplate resulted in mobility lower than the limit. But these configurations exceed the yield limit of titanium miniplate. Conclusions: FEA may be useful in evaluation of other plate constructs, fracture types, and fracture sites, as confirmed by the agreement between our data and those in the literature and with clinical experience. This analysis should permit us to suggest and evaluate new miniplate designs and enable considerable savings to be made in terms of time, material, and animal experiments in the future development of osteosynthesis materials and techniques.

Materials From January 2009 to December 2018, 93 charts of patients with pelvic fractures were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with failure of the anterior ring internal fixation within 3 months after initial surgery were analyzed. Quality of reduction was evaluated using the Majeed scoring system. Patients aging >= 18 years, with unstable pelvic fractures, Tile classification type B and type C pelvic fractures, combined injury of other organs that did not affect the operation and without important neurovascular damage were included. The exclusion criteria included: (1) pathological fracture, or combined with pelvic bone tumor or severe osteoporosis; (2) femoral fracture and thoracolumbar fracture; (3) open pelvic fracture; (4) Morel-Lavallee injury; (5) complicated acetabular fracture. The quality of the reduction of the anterior pelvic ring injury was evaluated on the x-ray film using the Majeed scoring system. Results According to the Tile classification of fracture, there were 23 cases of type B1, 17 cases of type B2, 11 cases of type B3, 28 cases of type C1, 6 cases of type C2, and 8 cases of type C3. The duration from injury to pelvic internal fixation ranged from 5 to 28 days. Seven out of 93 patients experienced failure of internal fixation of the anterior pelvic ring within 3 months, including 2 patients fixed with an external fixator and 5 patients fixed with a plate. Five patients undergoing revision surgery were followed up for 6-36 months with an average of 18 months. According to Majeed's score at the last follow-up in the 5 patients undergoing revision surgery, there were 2 cases of excellent, 2 cases of good, 1 case of fair. The excellent and good rate reached 80%. Conclusion The treatment of complicated unstable pelvic fractures requires performing internal fixation surgery within 2 weeks. It is necessary to make a preoperative plan and stabilize the posterior ring first, avoiding a single steel plate crossing the pubic symphysis.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the short-term functional outcome and complications of total hip arthroplasty (THA) following failed fixation of proximal hip fracture. Materials and Methods: In a retrospective study, 21 hips in 20 patients (13 females and seven males) with complications of operated hip fractures as indicated by either established nonunion or fracture collapse with hardware failure were analysed. Mean age of the patients was 62 years (range 38 years to 85 years). Nine patients were treated for femoral neck fracture, 10 for intertrochanteric (I/T) fracture and two for subtrochanteric (S/T) fracture of the hip. Uncemented THA was done in 11 cases, cemented THA in eight hip joints and hybrid THA in two patients. Results: The average duration of follow-up was four years (2-13 years). The mean duration of surgery was 125 min and blood loss was 1300 ml. There were three dislocations postoperatively. Two were managed conservatively and one was operated. There was one superficial infection and one deep infection. Only one patient required a walker while four required walking stick for ambulation. The mean Harris Hip score increased from 32 preoperatively to 79 postoperatively at one year interval. Conclusion: Total hip arthroplasty is an effective salvage procedure after failed osteosynthesis of hip fractures. Most patients have good pain relief and functional improvements inspite of technical difficulties and high complication rates than primary arthroplasty.

J	Fan, YB; Xiu, KH; Duan, H; Zhang, M				Fan, Yubo; Xiu, Kaihua; Duan, Hong; Zhang, Ming			Biomechanical and histological evaluation of the application of biodegradable poly-L-lactic cushion to the plate internal fixation for bone fracture healing	CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS			English	Article						Internal fixation; PLLA; Stress shielding; Finite element analysis; Blood supply	STAINLESS-STEEL; STRESS; PROTECTION; DOGS	Background. Internal plate fixation of fracture can provide favorable mechanical environment for fracture fragments. However, osteoporosis under the plate is often found, and refracture may occur after the plate is removed. There are two different opinions about the bone loss beneath the plate: the first is the stress shielding effect brought by the rigid fixation, and the second is the insufficient blood supply of the bone caused by the placement of the plate. In this paper, we tried to achieve a favorable condition for the fracture healing by inserting a kind of biodegradable cushion, through which the stress shielding effect and the interruption of the bone blood supply could be relieved at the same time. Methods. Animal models of internal fixation for tibia diaphyseal fracture with the placement of the poly-L-lactic (PLLA) cushion between the plate and the bone were established; a series of in vitro investigations and finite element (FE) analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of this new internal fixation system. Findings. During both the initial and 50% healing periods, the extent of stress shielding of the fracture zone decreased due to the use of the PLLA cushion. Especially for the 50% healing stage, the insertion of the PLLA cushion on alleviating the stress shielding of the bone tissue between the inner two screws directly under the plate is more apparent than that at the initial healing period. Meanwhile, radiological and histological coloration results demonstrated sooner callus growth and better trabecular rearrangement of the fracture zone in the PLLA group with the degradation of the PLLA cushion during the healing periods. Interpretations. This study showed that the use of the PLLA cushion at the initial period did not impair the stability of the whole system, which provides a favorable mechanical environment for the following fracture healing. On the other hand, its superiorities on alleviating stress shielding effect and interruption with the blood supply of the bone tissue beneath the plate contributed to the favorable fracture healing conditions in PLLA group with the degradation of the materials.

Materials and methods: Participants were randomly selected and invited to voluntarily answer a questionnaire of 10 multiple choice questions addressing the main aspects of the treatment of pelvic fractures: classification, fixation methods in unstable patients, optimal surgical timing in stable patients, and fixation methods in different types of anterior and posterior pelvic injuries. Results/Conclusion: Three hundred and fifty-two questionnaires were completed, and the following main observations were made: most orthopaedists prefer to use an external fixator in the iliac crest for the emergency stabilisation of pelvic injuries in haemodynamically unstable patients (79.5%); they consider a period of up to one week as optimal for fixation in stable patients (55.1%); they use a plate for the fixation of fractures of the iliopubic rami through a Pfannenstiel or ilio-inguinal approach (53.9%); and they use reconstruction plates for the fixation of fractures of the iliac wing (63.1%). Regarding other studied aspects, there was no predominance of more than 50% of the choices among respondents. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Trans-obturator cable fixation of open book pelvic injuries	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; PUBIC SYMPHYSIS; PLATE FIXATION; FRACTURES; STABILITY; DIASTASIS; COMPRESSION; DISRUPTIONS; MANAGEMENT	Operative treatment of ruptured pubic symphysis by plating is often accompanied by complications. Trans-obturator cable fixation might be a more reliable technique; however, have not yet been tested for stabilization of ruptured pubic symphysis. This study compares symphyseal trans-obturator cable fixation versus plating through biomechanical testing and evaluates safety in a cadaver experiment. APC type II injuries were generated in synthetic pelvic models and subsequently separated into three different groups. The anterior pelvic ring was fixed using a four-hole steel plate in Group A, a stainless steel cable in Group B, and a titan band in Group C. Biomechanical testing was conducted by a single-leg-stance model using a material testing machine under physiological load levels. A cadaver study was carried out to analyze the trans-obturator surgical approach. Peak-to-peak displacement, total displacement, plastic deformation and stiffness revealed a tendency for higher stability for trans-obturator cable/band fixation but no statistical difference to plating was detected. The cadaver study revealed a safe zone for cable passage with sufficient distance to the obturator canal. Trans-obturator cable fixation has the potential to become an alternative for symphyseal fixation with less complications.

To enhance the post-operative tensile strength, we proposed and tested an internal fixation technique using a polycaprolactone (PCL) biofilm. PCL was chosen for its good biocompatibility, excellent mechanical strength, and an appropriate degradation time scale. Methods: PCL biofilms were prepared by a modified melt-molding/leaching technique, and the physical and mechanical properties and in vitro degradation rate were assessed. The pore size distribution of the biofilm and the paratenon of native tendons were observed using scanning electron microscopy. Next, we determined whether this biofilm could enhance the tensile strength of repaired tendons. We performed tensile tests on rabbit Achilles tendons that were first lacerated and then repaired: 1) using modified Kessler suture combined with running peripheral suture ('control' group), or 2) using biofilm to wrap the tendon and then fixation with sutures ('biofilm' group). The influence of different repair techniques on tendon tensile strength was evaluated by mechanical testing. Results: The novel biofilm had supple texture and a smooth surface. The mean thickness of the biofilm was 0.25 mm. The mean porosity of the biofilm was 45.3%. The paratenon of the rabbit Achilles tendon had pores with diameters ranging from 1 to 9 mu m, which were similar to the 4-12 mu m diameter pores in the biofilm cross-section. The weight loss of the biofilms at 4 weeks was only 0.07%. The molecular weight of PCL biofilms did not change after immersion in phosphate buffered saline for 4 weeks. The failure loads of the biofilm were similar before (48 +/- 9 N) and after immersion (47 +/- 7 N, P > 0.1). The biofilm group had similar to 70% higher mean failure loads and 93% higher stiffness compared with the control group. Conclusions: We proposed and tested an internal fixation technique using a PCL biofilm to enhance tendon repair. Internal fixation with the biofilm followed by standard suturing can significantly increase the tensile strength of tendon repair sites. This technique has the potential to allow active motion rehabilitation during the early postoperative period.

How to fix the osteotomy and which point to choose for the procedure has been a focus for most surgeons. The aim of this study was to analyse the outcomes of a series of patients who had been treated for pes cavus deformity using midfoot osteotomy combined with adjacent joint sparing internal fixation. Materials and methods: Between 2008 and 2012, 17 patients with a mean age of 16.8 years (12-36 years) were tracked after treatment by midfoot osteotomy combined with adjacent joint sparing internal fixation with three cannulated screws between the Lisfranc line and Cyma line. Clinical outcomes were assessed by measuring improvements of appearance and function, American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores, and radiographic changes. Results: The mean follow-up time was 25.3 months (range, 10-50). The mean healing time from the osteotomy was 7.8 weeks (range, 6-12). The appearance and weight-bearing function were significantly improved in all patients. At a final follow-up, the mean AOFAS score was 75.8/100 points (range, 63-90). The mean Meary's angle, calcaneal pitch angle, tibiotalar angle, and Hibb's angle values improved from 26.3 to 5.5, 44.5 to 28.3, 133.1 to 100.8 and 66.9 to 41.1, respectively. Adjacent joints presented no obviously arthritic degeneration at the follow-up. Subjectively, 94.1% of patients were very satisfied or satisfied with minor reservations. Objective outcomes were excellent or good in 88.2% of feet. Conclusion: For the treatment of rigid pes cavus deformity, extra-articular midfoot osteotomy combined with adjacent joint sparing internal fixation is effective and safe. This surgical technique is especially effective with low rates of arthritic degeneration and joint stiffness in the adjacent joints and little reduction of ankle and foot flexibility.

Although it provides better outcome than closed treatment questions still remain about the surgical approach and the osteosynthesis devices to be used. Between 2005 and 2010, we managed 168 mandibular condyle fractures with open treatment. Two surgical approaches were used in this study, a pre-auricular and a high submandibular approach (one or the other or as a combined approach). Internal fixation was performed using TCP (R) plates (Medartis, Basel, Switzerland) or with two lag screws (15 and 17 mm). Delta plates were used in 15 cases (8.9%). We report the epidemiology of these fractures and the outcomes of the surgical treatment. We assessed the complications related to the surgical procedure and those related to the osteosynthesis material. The facial nerve related complication rate was very low and the osteosynthesis materials used proved to be strong enough to realize a stable fixation. The two approaches used in this study appeared to be safe with good aesthetic results. Most of the surgical procedure failures occurred in high subcondylar fractures especially when bilateral.

Materials and methodsThe medical records of 88 patients who were diagnosed with COVF and underwent posterior internal fixation in our hospital from January 2013 to December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The included patients were divided into two groups according to whether they suffered PJK after surgery, namely, the PJK group (25 cases) and non-PJK group (63 cases). The following clinical characteristics were recorded and analyzed: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), bone mineral density (BMD), smoking history, fracture segment, proximal junction angle, sagittal vertebral axis, pelvic incidence (PI)-lumbar lordosis (LL), pelvic tilt (PT), sacral slope (SS), posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) injury, upper instrumented vertebra, lower instrumented vertebra, and the number of fixed segments. The prevalence of these clinical characteristics in the PJK group was evaluated, and the scoring system was established using logistic regression analysis. The performance of the scoring system was also prospectively validated. ResultsThe predictive scoring system was established based on five clinical characteristics confirmed as significant predictors of PJK, namely, age > 70 years, BMI > 28 kg/m(2), BMD < -3.5 SD, preoperative PI-LL > 20 degrees, and PLC injury. PJK showed a significantly higher score than non-PJK (7.80 points vs. 2.83 points, t=9.556, P<0.001), and the optimal cutoff value for the scoring system was 5 points. The sensitivity and specificity of the scoring system for predicting postoperative PJK were 80.00% and 88.89%, respectively, in the derivation set and 75.00% and 80.00% in the validation set. ConclusionThe predictive scoring system was confirmed with satisfactory sensitivity and specificity in predicting PJK after posterior internal fixation in elderly COVF patients. The risk of postoperative PJK in patients with a score of 6-11 is high, while the score of 0-5 is low.

Design: Randomized comparative study oil embalmed human pelvises. Materials and Methods: In 12 specimens, we created a symphysiolysis and sacral fractures oil both sides. Each of these 24 sacral fractures was fixed with 1 of the following methods: 1 sacroiliac screw in the vertebral body of S1,2 screws convergingly in S1. or 1 screw in S1 and 1 in S2. Oil the left and right side of a pelvis, different techniques were used. The pubic symphysis was not stabilized. We measured the translation and rotation stiffness of the fixations and the load to failure using a 3-dimensional video system. Results: The stiffness of the intact posterior pelvic ring was superior to any screw technique. Significant differences were found for the load to failure and rotation stiffness between the techniques with 2 screws and a single screw in S1. The techniques utilizing 2 screws showed no differences. Conclusions: Based on the results of this Study, we can conclude that a second sacroiliac screw in Completely unstable pelvic fractures increases rotation stiffness and improves the load to failure.

In this study we investigated the stability of three commonly used patterns of plate fixation, and constructed finite element models of a simulated mandibular condylar fracture. The completed models were heterogeneous in the distribution of bony material properties, contained about 1.2 million elements, and incorporated simulated jaw-adducting musculature. Models were run assuming linear elasticity and isotropic material properties for bone. This model was considerably larger and more complex than previous finite element models that have been used to analyse the biomechanical behaviour of differing plating techniques. The use of two parallel 2.0 titanium miniplates gave a more stable configuration with lower mean element stresses and displacements over the use of a single miniplate. In addition, a parallel orientation of two miniplates resulted in lower stresses and displacements than did the use of two miniplates in an offset pattern. The use of two parallel titanium plates resulted in a superior biomechanical result as defined by mean element stresses and relative movement between the fractured fragments in these finite element models.

J	Watson, JT				Watson, JT			The use of an injectable bone graft substitute in tibial metaphyseal fractures	ORTHOPEDICS			English	Article							PLATEAU FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; CALCIUM-SULFATE; CEMENT; HYDROXYAPATITE; TRIAL	Eight consecutive patients with severely comminuted proximal or distal tibial metaphyseal fractures were surgically treated with a novel injectable, in situ hardening calcium sulfate material to provide temporary intraoperative structural support until instrumentation was appropriately placed. The calcium sulfate bone substitute was also used as a bone void filler to provide an osteoconductive environment following stabilization. Bone regrowth was observed in all patients and, in seven of the eight patients, 90%-100% bone formation was observed within 3 months. The bone substitute had almost completely resorbed by 3 months in all patients. One patient with extensive initial bone loss required a second bone graft. Although the patient sample size was small, the success rate of treating severely comminuted fractures was significantly better than in reports using only internal fixation. Injectable bone substitute provides a viable alternative for minimally invasive surgery to repair metaphyseal fractures.

Open reduction and internal fixation of the posterior malleolus fragment frequently restores syndesmotic stability	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Ankle fracture; Trimalleolar fracture; Posterior malleolus; Open reduction internal fixation; Trans-syndesmotic fixation	ANKLE FRACTURES; MANAGEMENT; SCREW; CLASSIFICATION; ANATOMY; SIZE	Aim: Comparison of unfixed, CRIF, and ORIF of the posterior malleolus fragment (PMF) regarding the frequency of trans-syndesmotic fixation and quality of reduction in trimalleolar (equivalent) fractures. Material and Methods: Retrospective registry study. Patients with a trimalleolar (equivalent) ankle fractures were identified within the departments' fracture database. General demographics, treatment details, and fracture specific details (CT-scans) were assessed. Patients were grouped per the PMF treatment: not addressed, CRIF, ORIF. Results: 236 patients (53.0 +/- 18.3 (range: 18-100) years), 58.1% female were eligible. The mean size of the PMF was 21.4 +/- 10.4% (range: 2.7-55.9%), 71.6% were <= 25% of the tibial plafond. PMF fixation: Untreated 48.3%, CRIF 18.6%, ORIF 33.1%. ORIF of the PMF significantly (p <0.001) reduced the frequency of trans-syndesmotic fixation (25%) compared to CRIF (61%) or untreated PMF (63%) with no significant influence of the PMF size (<25%>25%). ORIF resulted in a significantly (p <0.001) better quality of reduction (1.2 +/- 1.1 mm (range: 0-5 mm)) compared to CRIF (2.5 +/- 2.1 mm (range: 0-8 mm)) and untreated PMF (2.5 +/- 2.3 mm (range: 0-20 mm)). Neither the frequency of trans-syndesmotic fixation nor the quality of reduction differed significantly between untreated PMF and CRIF. Conclusion: All posterior malleolus fragments, independent of their size, should be treated by ORIF, as this restores syndesmotic stability significantly more often than untreated PMF or CRIF.

Proximal Humeral Nonunion Treated With an Intramedullary Tantalum Cylinder	ORTHOPEDICS			English	Article							LOCKING-PLATE FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; ENDOSTEAL IMPLANT; INTERNAL-FIXATION; BONE LOSS; FRACTURES; ARTHROPLASTY; MANAGEMENT; GRAFT	Nonunion is uncommon after proximal humerus fracture surgery. There is no agreement about preferred method of treatment. Traditional approaches have included laterally based locking plates, autogenous grafting, and endosteal support to provide improved biomechanical stability. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of proximal humeral nonunion has been performed with various methods, including blade plates and bone grafting, as well as intramedullary support with autologous or allogenic grafts. Both malunion and nonunion have occurred after ORIF with locking plates. Endosteal support in the form of a fibular allograft incorporated into the locking plate construct can increase mechanical stability in selected cases. An ideal implant for proximal humeral nonunion provides medial column mechanical support and osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties. Porous intramedullary tantalum metal may play a role in nonunion surgery as an alternative to fibular allograft because of its versatility of use and salutary biological effects. It offers many material advantages for use in nonunion surgery. Tantalum is extensively porous (75%-80%), has a stiffness close to that of native bone, and offers the possibility of being a carrier for osteoinductive materials. It may also be suitable for patients who refuse allograft material. This article describes a 65-year-old woman with recalcitrant proximal humeral nonunion who was successfully treated with revision ORIF with intramedullary tantalum cylinder augmentation with a lateral-based locking plate and autogenous cancellous bone grafting. At 5-year follow-up, she had excellent motion and clinical and radiographic union.

Single-group prospective follow-up study. Objectives. To assess the functional outcome of internal fixation of the pelvic ring in patients with severe pregnancy-related low back and pelvic pain (PLBP) in whom all other treatments failed. Background data. More than half of all pregnant women experience PLBP. In most cases, the pain disappears after childbirth. In some, however, the pain becomes chronic and patients may be wheelchair-bound or bedridden. After failure of all conservative treatment, surgical fixation of the pelvic ring seems to be the only remaining option for those severe cases. Materials and Methods. The postsurgical functional outcome of 58 severe PLBP patients was evaluated with the Majeed score and endurance of walking, sitting, and standing. Inclusion criteria were serious disability and failure of all conservative treatment. The surgical technique consisted of a symphysiodesis and bilateral percutaneous placement of two sacroiliac screws under fluoroscopic guidance. Results. With a follow-up of an average of 2.1 years, the difference between preoperative and postoperative Majeed score indicated that an improvement of more than 10 points was achieved in 69.8% and 89.3% of the patients at 12 and 24 months, respectively. The most important complications were irritation of nerve roots (8.6%), nonunion of the symphysis (15.5%), failure of the symphyseal plate (3.4%), and pulmonary embolism (1.7%). Conclusions. In this preliminary study, surgical fixation of the pelvic ring yielded satisfactory results in severe PLBP patients in terms of pain relief and improvement in ADL functions. These results should be confirmed in a randomized clinical trial.

Methods: An extraarticular severely comminuted distal femoral fracture pattern (OTA/AO 33-A3) was simulated using artificial bone substitutes. Ten-hole distal lateral femur locking plates were used for fixation per the recommended surgical technique. At the distal metaphyseal fragment, all possible locking screws were placed. For the proximal diaphyseal fragment, different types of screws were used to create 4 different fixation constructs: (1) stainless steel hybrid (SSH), (2) stainless steel locked (SSL), (3) titanium locked (TiL), and (4) stainless steel locked with 5-mm offset at the diaphysis (SSLO). Six specimens of each construct configuration were tested. First, each specimen was nondestructively loaded axially to determine the stiffness. Then, each specimen was cyclically loaded with increasing load levels until failure. Results: Construct Stiffness: The fixation construct with a stainless steel plate and hybrid fixation (SSH) had the highest stiffness followed by the construct with a stainless steel plate and locking screws (SSL) and were not statistically different from each other. Offset placement (SSLO) and using a titanium implant (TiL) significantly reduced construct stiffness. Fatigue Failure: The stainless steel with hybrid fixation group (SSH) withstood the most number of cycles to failure and higher loads, followed by the stainless steel plate and locking screw group (SSL), stainless steel plate with locking screws and offset group (SSLO), and the titanium plate and locking screws group (TiL) consecutively. Offset placement (SSLO) as well as using a titanium implant (TiL) reduced cycles to failure. Conclusions: Using the same plate design, the study showed that implant material, screw type, and position of the plate affect the construct stiffness and fatigue life of the fixation construct. With this knowledge, the surgeon can decide the optimal construct based on a given fracture pattern, bone strength, and reduction quality.

BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH-INDIA			English	Article						Polyetheretherketone; Interbody fusion cage; Pedicle screw-based internal fixation; Senile; Lumbar degenerative diseases	PEEK RODS; SPINE; METAANALYSIS; SURGERY	Objective: Our objective is to analyse the clinical effect and safety of Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cage for lumbar fusion and the pedicle screw-based internal fixation in senile lumbar degenerative diseases, and further discuss the value of clinical application. Methods: 172 patients with senile lumber degenerative diseases admitted in our hospital during March, 2013-March, 2016 were selected, which were divided into the observation group and control group according to the random number method with 86 cases in either group. All the patients received lumbar inter-body fusion and pedicle screw-based internal fixation, in the observation group the material for inter-body infusion was PEEK and in the control group was titanium alloy. The surgery condition and complications in two groups were compared, and Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores, Oswestry disability index (ODI) scores, ranges of joint motion, disc space heights and fusion rates were also observed to explore the applicable value of PEEK cage for lumbar fusion in senile lumbar degenerative diseases. Results: The operation time and intraoperative blood loss in two groups were not statistically different (P>0.05); there was no infection or nerve root injury and no looseness or breakage of internal fixation during follow-up, the bone graft recovered well. Compared with before surgery, the JOA scores were increased and ODI scores were decreased at 3 and 6 months after surgery, which were statistically significant (P<0.05), JOA and ODI scores between two groups at the same stages after surgery were not statistically different (P>0.05). Compared to before surgery, the motion ranges of instrumented segments in two groups were both decreased, and the motion ranges and the disc space heights of adjacent segments were both increased. After 6 months, the motion ranges of instrumented segments and adjacent segments and the disc space heights in the observation group were higher than the control group, which were statistically significant (P<0.05); The fusion rates of bone graft between two groups at the same stages after surgery were not statistically different (P>0.05). Conclusion: The clinical effects and safety of PEEK for lumbar fusion and the pedicle screw-based internal fixation in senile lumbar degenerative diseases are good. PEEK cage can better improve the range of joint motion and disc space height compared with titanium alloy cage, which is worthy of further application.

However, their strength and stability for fixation in mandibular subcondylar fractures remain unclear. This in vitro study aimed to assess the biomechanical strength of u-HA/PLLA bioresorbable plate systems after internal fixation of mandibular subcondylar fractures. Tensile and shear strength were measured for each u-HA/PLLA and titanium plate system. To evaluate biomechanical behavior, 20 hemimandible replicas were divided into 10 groups, each comprising a titanium plate and a bioresorbable plate. A linear load was applied anteroposteriorly and lateromedially to each group to simulate the muscular forces in mandibular condylar fractures. All samples were analyzed for each displacement load and the displacement obtained by the maximum load. Tensile and shear strength of the u-HA/PLLA plate were each approximately 45% of those of the titanium plates. Mechanical resistance was worst in the u-HA/PLLA plate initially loaded anteroposteriorly. Titanium plates showed the best mechanical resistance during lateromedial loading. Notably, both plates showed similar resistance when a lateromedially load was applied. In the biomechanical evaluation of mandibular condylar fracture treatment, the u-HA/PLLA plates had sufficiently high resistance in the two-plate fixation method.

The Fate of Syndesmotic Screws	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Ankle Joint; Bone Screws; Fracture Fixation; Internal; Articular; Ligaments; Syndesmosis	ANKLE SYNDESMOSIS; FIXATION; FRACTURES	Background: A standard protocol for the management of syndesmosis injuries has yet to be established. Debate persists regarding number of screws, screw diameter, number of cortices purchased, and the need for and timing of screw removal. The purpose of this study was to identify factors related to screw fixation that may lead to the ultimate failure of syndesmosis fixation defined as a loss of reduction of the syndesmosis, screw breakage, screw loosening, or widening of the medial clear space. Materials and Methods: A retrospective assessment of 137 consecutive patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation of the distal tibiofibular joint at a single institution from 2004 to 2008 was performed. Clinical and radiographic data were recorded regarding problems with questionable clinical significance (number of syndesmotic screws, number of cortices, screw diameter, screw location, hardware failure) and loss of syndesmosis reduction. A series of Fisher's exact tests were used to evaluate outcomes. A p value of 0.05 defined as significant. Results: The 3.5-mm diameter screws were statistically more likely to break than 4- or 4.5-mm screws, but there was no difference in frequency of loss of reduction of the syndesmosis as a function of screw diameter; however, a power study revealed an n value of 1656 would be required to show a significant difference. Conclusion: Screw diameter may have an effect on screw breakage but clinical significance of hardware failure itself is unknown including whether or not it results in a loss of reduction or failure of syndesmotic fixation.

Vascular risk reduction during anterior surgical approach sacroiliac joint plating	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Nutrient artery; Sacroiliac joint; Injury; Vasculature; Pelvis; Nutrient foramen	ANATOMIC CONSIDERATIONS; ILIOLUMBAR ARTERY	Introduction: Open reduction and internal fixation of sacroiliac (SI) joint is often performed through an anterior approach. However, there were no studies to our knowledge which described the "at risk area" for injury to the nutrient artery as it relates to open reduction and internal fixation of the SI joint. The purpose of this study was to determine the "at risk area" for the nutrient artery during anterior surgical approaches to the SI joint and to define the safe location of the plate for SI joint fixation. Materials and methods: Six right and five left hemipelvises (three male and three female cadavers) were dissected with a mean age of 72 years (range, 51-90 years). Three bony landmarks including the pelvic brim, anterior SI joint line, and the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) were identified to quantify the measurements. Three different measurements were taken: from the nutrient foramen to the anterior SI joint line; from the nutrient foramen to the nearest point on the pelvic brim; from the nutrient foramen to ASIS using a flexible ruler with a 1 mm base. Results: The nutrient artery courses across the SI joint to enter into the nutrient foramen. Whilst exposing the internal surface of the SI joint, the nutrient foramen was identified at a mean distance of 88.1 mm medial to ASIS, 20.1 mm above the pelvic brim, and 20.1 mm lateral to SI joint. The variability of the location of the nutrient foramen was identified and was located from 80 mm to 95 mm medial to the ASIS, 12 mm to 25 mm lateral to the SI joint, and 16 mm to 30 mm above the pelvic brim. Conclusion: Familiarity of the vasculature of the internal pelvis is of utmost importance for the surgeon when considering operative fixation of the anterior SI joint. We were able to identify the relation of the nutrient artery to the anatomic landmarks of the internal pelvis and to define the "at risk area" for the nutrient artery. We believe increased understanding of the anatomy of the nutrient artery will aid in the avoidance of vascular complications during internal fixation of the anterior SI joint. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Short-Segment Pedicle Fixation of Traumatic Low Lumbar Fractures (L3-L5) Report of 36 Cases	CLINICAL SPINE SURGERY			English	Article						fractures; low lumbar; fracture fixation; internal; methods; L3-L5; lumbar vertebrae; surgery; pedicle fixation; short-segment fixation; spinal fractures; surgery; spinal fusion; methods	BURST FRACTURES; SPINAL FRACTURES	Study Design: Prospective review. Objective: The aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of short-segment pedicle fixation of low lumbar fractures (L3-L5). Background: Low lumbar fractures are relatively uncommon, and limited data exists regarding the management of these injuries. No previous studies have specifically examined the surgical management of L3-L5 fractures exclusively with pedicle fixation. Materials and Methods: We reviewed prospectively collected data of 36 patients who underwent short-segment pedicle fixation for low lumbar fractures at our institution between 1993 and 2018. Results: There was no worsening of neurological status following surgery, and three patients regained motor or sphincter function. Thirty-one (86.1%) patients went on to successful fusion. Three (8%) patients required reoperation. Four (11%) patients had surgical complications. Conclusions: This large series provides information regarding the safety and efficacy of surgical management of low lumbar fractures with pedicle fixation. Following surgery, there was no neurological worsening and some patients regained neurological function. Low complication rates, low reoperation rates, and low pain levels at final follow-up provide evidence that the surgical management of low lumbar fractures utilizing short-segment pedicle fixation is safe and efficacious.

Materials and methods For this purpose, experimental burst fractures were created in 11 bovine specimens with a hydraulic materials-testing machine. The specimens were evaluated with plain radiographs and CT scans before reduction. Thereafter, they were instrumented with titanium transpedicular screws and rods (short-segment posterior fixation); and reduction was achieved which included distraction and kyphosis correction maneuvers. Results Each spinal specimen was evaluated with plain radiographs and CT scans after reduction by applying distraction and kyphosis correction maneuvers. Plain radiographic analysis showed that the kyphosis angle and segmental height values improved. Furthermore, CT scans revealed that the spinal canal diameter values improved compared with those before reduction. The differences between before and after reduction in kyphosis angle, segmental height, anterior body compression, and percentage of retropulsion were statistically significant. Conclusion Short-segment posterior fixation followed by indirect spinal canal decompression led to an improvement over spinal canal retropulsion in experimental burst fractures. Furthermore, the kyphosis angle and segmental height values improved following the reduction compared with those before reduction.

Intercondylar eminence fracture treated by resorbable magnesium screws osteosynthesis: A case series	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Knee; Tibia; Fracture; Intercondylar; Eminence; Avulsion; Magnesium; Resorbable; Screws; Osteosynthesis	TIBIAL SPINE FRACTURES; TERM-FOLLOW-UP; AVULSION FRACTURE; ARTHROSCOPIC FIXATION; CANNULATED SCREW; SUTURE FIXATION; BONE RESPONSE; CHILDREN; IMPLANTS; MANAGEMENT	Introduction: Tibial spine avulsion fractures are mostly a paediatric injury which appropriate treatment is currently debated in literature. The choice between conservative and surgical treatment is based on the radiographic classification of Meyers-McKeever. The most diffused surgical techniques involve either internal fixation devices (screws) or bone tunnels fixation with resorbable sutures. Today, a third option is represented by resorbable magnesium screws which could combine the best features of the two classical systems. Objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of these new devices in the surgical treatment of tibial spine avulsions. Materials and methods: Since 2014 we have seen seven patients with tibial eminence fracture. Patients underwent clinical and radiological examination (MRI, CT scan) before surgery. Only 3 patients that presented with a grade III or IV lesion were treated surgically with internal fixation with magnesium resorbable screws. In post-operative follow-up, functional recovery was evaluated at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 12 months, clinically and by X-ray. Lysholm and IKDC scores were submitted at 1, 2, 6 and 12 months. MRI was repeated at 6 and 12 months. Results: All three surgical patients showed progressive clinical and functional improvement during the follow-up period. The first case showed a quicker overall recovery rate, which might be due to the lower grade of the lesion. Radiographs and MRI evaluation showed regular healing of the injury. The devices appeared completely resorbed at the 6 months follow-up and replaced by newly formed bone at the 12 months follow-up. Conclusions: The treatment of tibial spine avulsion fractures with arthroscopic reduction and internal fixation (ARIF) technique by magnesium resorbable screws seems to result in an excellent functional recovery without complications related to fixation devices, which were completely resorbed after 6 months and replaced by newly formed bone after 12 months. This new method could be considered as an alternative option to classic techniques by non resorbable fixation devices or bone tunnel fixation. Further studies are needed in order to evaluate the efficacy of these new devices in a wider group of patients. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Material and methods: Following an exhaustive search of scientific literature databases for high quality studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) related to our study topic were screened and selected based on stringent predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data extracted from the selected studies were used for statistical analyses using Stata 12.0 software. Results: A total of 17 RCTs, including 1658 DRF patients, were enrolled in this network meta-analysis. Among the 1658 DRF patients, 452 received bridging external fixation, 525 received non-bridging external fixation, 154 received K-wire fixation, 84 received plaster fixation, 132 received dorsal plating, 123 received volar plating, and 188 received dorsal and volar plating. When compared to bridging external fixation patients, there was no marked difference in the CRPS risk in DRF patients receiving different treatments (all p > 0.05). However, the surface under the cumulative ranking curves (SUCRA) for plaster fixation (77.0%) and non-bridging external fixation (71.3%) were significantly higher compared with the other five methods. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that compared with bridging external fixation, K-wire fixation, dorsal plating, volar plating, dorsal and volar plating, plaster fixation and non-bridging external fixation might be the better treatment methods to reduce the risk of CRPS in DRF patients.

A model of the mandible was modeled aided with computed tomography (CT) images. The CT images were converted to the finite element model aided by reverse engineering methodology. 3 materials for mini plate and fixators (Titanium Alloy, Chrome-Cobalt and Stainless Steel) were designed with different geometry variations ("Y", "I" and "Square") and two different fracture types (linear and oblique). The finite element analyses (FEA) (In Slico) were performed with respect to displacement and stress distributions for both mandibula and fixators. According to all FEA results, "Square" type fixators for linear fracture type had a minimum stress distribution. In addition, the "I" type double fixators (for oblique fractures) with titanium alloy have more favorable stress distribution and also chrome-cobalt material for have best displacement results than the others. FEA is useful for comparing geometry and material variations of rigid mandibular fixations. The finite-element method showed that when selecting mini plate we consider geometry and material variations.

Materials and methods: A total of 81 patients with 82 proximal humerus fractures (one patient had bilateral fracture) were treated at our institution with open reduction and internal fixation with Philos (R) plate from January 2008 to December 2012 and the clinico-radiological outcome was analysed. Twelve of these patients also had a dislocation of the proximal humerus. According to the Neer classification, there were seven two-part fractures, 40 three-part fractures and 35 four-part fractures. All patients received a similar physical therapy programme following internal fixation. Mean final follow-up was 32 months. Functional outcome was evaluated for each patient using the Constant-Murley score; radiographic evaluation was also conducted and complications were recorded. Results: At the end of the follow-up period, the mean Constant-Murley score for the injured side was 75 points (range 42-92); results were graded as excellent for eight patients, good for 52, moderate for 17 and poor for five. Twenty-three patients (28%) had complications during the follow-up period. Reoperation was required in 12 patients. Complications included avascular necrosis of the humeral head in 10 patients (12%), varus positioning of the head in four patients (4.8%), impingement syndrome in three patients (3.6%), secondary screw perforation in three patients (3.6%), non-union of the fracture in two patients (2.4%) and infection in one patient (1.2%). Conclusions: Open reduction and internal fixation of proximal humeral fractures with the Philos (R) plate was associated with good clinical outcomes provided the correct surgical technique was used. To better evaluate the real incidence of complications, it is important to follow patients for more than one year after surgery as some complications may arise after this time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Both provide stable fixation; however, there is minimal evidence concerning the soft-tissue response to these materials. Our objective was to evaluate the response of adjacent extensor tendons to titanium and stainless steel in a rabbit in vivo model and to evaluate the influence of time. Methods: Forty rabbits were divided into 5 groups of 8 rabbits each. Groups I and II had unilateral osteotomy of the distal radius followed by dorsal fixation with titanium and stainless steel plates, respectively. Groups III and IV had fixation with titanium and stainless steel, respectively, but without osteotomy. Group V had surgical dissection without osteotomy or plates. Two animals per group were killed at 1, 4, 12, and 24 weeks. The specimens (distal radius, plate, overlying soft tissue, and extensor tendon) were harvested en bloc for histologic analysis. For interface preservation between implant and tissues the specimens were embedded in methylmethacrylate, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Results: Histologic analysis showed a fibrous tissue layer formed over both implants between the plate and the overlying extensor tendons in the groups treated with plating independently of the material and the presence or absence of osteotomy. This fibrous layer contained the majority of debris. Metallic particles were not observed in the tendon or muscle substance of any animals; however, they were visualized in the tenosynovium. Hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections of groups I through IV showed proliferative fibroblasts and metallic particles; however, this layer was not observed in group V. Statistical analysis did not show differences between the groups regarding the number of cells or metallic particles. Conclusions: Our results indicate that both implants generated adjacent reactive inflammatory tissue and particulate debris. There was no difference in cell or particle number produced by both materials. There is a statistically significant increase in inflammatory cells with increasing time of implantation.

In this work, a surgically feasible ORIF methodology, called AdhFix, is developed by combining screws with polymer/hydroxyapatite composites, which are applied and shaped in situ before being rapidly cured on demand via high-energy visible-light-induced thiol-ene coupling chemistry. The method is developed on porcine metacarpals with transverse and multifragmented fractures, resulting in strong and stable fixations with a bending rigidity of 0.28 (0.03) N m(2) and a maximum load before break of 220 (15) N. Evaluations on human cadaver hands with proximal phalanx fractures show that AdhFix withstands the forces from finger flexing exercises, while short- and long-term in vivo rat femur fracture models show that AdhFix successfully supports bone healing without degradation, adverse effects, or soft-tissue adhesions. This procedure represents a radical new approach to fracture fixation, which grants surgeons unparalleled customizability and does not result in soft-tissue adhesions.

Materials and Methods: Five titanium plating techniques for fixation of condylar fracture were analyzed using the finite element method. The modeled techniques were 1) 1 straight plate, 2) 2 parallel straight plates, 3) 2 angulated straight plates, 4) 1 trapezoidal plate, and 5) 1 square plate. Three-dimensional models were generated using patient-specific geometry for the mandible obtained from a computerized tomographic image of a healthy living man. Plates were designed and combined with the mandible and analyzed under a 500-N load. Results: The single straight plate presented the most inferior performance; it presented maximum displacement and strain on cortical bone. The trapezoidal plate induced the least amount of strain on cortical bone and was best at resisting displacement. Conclusion: The trapezoidal plate is recommended for fixation of subcondylar fracture.

Canine Vertebral Screw and Rod Fixation System: Design and Mechanical Testing	VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ORTHOPAEDICS AND TRAUMATOLOGY			English	Article						dog; canine; spine; pedicle screw and rod fixation; vertebral screw	INTERNAL-FIXATION; PULLOUT STRENGTH; PEDICLE SCREWS; SPINE; STABILITY; MODEL	Objectives To develop the canine vertebral screw and rod fixation system (CVSRF) and to compare the biomechanical properties between CVSRF and the screw and polymethylmethacrylate (Screw-PMMA) technique for internal fixation of the vertebral column in dogs. Methods The CVSRF consisted of vertebral screws with monoaxial side-loaded head, rods and specific inner screws connecting rod to the screw head. The CVSRF prototype was made from titanium alloy and manufactured by the rapid prototype machine. Vertebrectomy models were simulated by ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene blocks and tested with the CVSRF system (n = 8) and the Screw-PMMA technique (n = 8). The models were developed according to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM F-1717-04). The biomechanical parameters were the compressive bending yield load, the compressive bending stiffness, the compressive ultimate load and the load displacement curve. Results Themean values of the compressive bending yield load, compressive bending stiffness and compressive ultimate load of the CVSRF were significantly higher than those of the Screw-PMMA technique (p < 0.01). The load displacement curve of the CVSRF showed higher rigidity and durability than that of the Screw-PMMA technique. Clinical Significance This mechanical study indicated that the CVSRF system can be used for canine vertebral stabilization and the biomechanical properties were better than those for the Screw-PMMA device.

However, all currently available instruments have some disadvantages. A new reduction clamp that can firmly enable reduction and not hinder subsequent fixation procedures for some special fracture types is needed. Materials and Methods: In this study, we introduce a new acetabular clamp and its preliminary clinical application in three T-shaped acetabular fractures. Results: This new clamp can successfully pull the posterior column back to the anterior column and firmly maintain the reduction. This clamps aiming plate can facilitate the insertion of long lag screws. The clamp is also easy to assemble and use. Conclusion: This reduction clamp is a useful instrument that can facilitate open reduction and internal fixation of acetabular fractures.

Corrosion of Ti6Al4V pins produced by direct metal laser sintering	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Internal fixation device; Ti6Al4V; Cyclic voltammetry; SEM; Tomography	TI-6AL-4V ALLOY; SURFACE; BEHAVIOR	Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) technique allows the manufacturing a wide variety of medical devices for any type of prosthetic surgery (HIP, dental, cranial, maxillofacial) as well as for internal fixation devices (K-Wires or Steinmann Pins). There are a large number of research studies on DMLS, including microstructural characterization, mechanical properties and those based on production quality assurance but the influence of porosity in the corrosion behavior of these materials not been sufficiently considered. In the present paper, surgical pins of Ti6Al4V have been produced by DMLS. After testing in a phosphate buffered saline solution, the surface of the titanium alloy appeared locally covered by a voluminous white oxide. This unexpected behavior was presumably due to the existence of internal defects in the pins as result of the manufacturing process. The importance of these defects that might act as crevice nucleation sites- has been revealed by electrochemical techniques and confirmed by computed tomography. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

M Materials and methods: Between April 2005 and September 2007, 29 Philos plates were implanted in 17 women and 12 men, with a mean age of 62.3 years (range: 28-80 years). Positioning of the plate was performed under fluoroscopic control, through a deltopectoral approach and with the patient in the beach chair position. 27 patients were available for follow-up (mean: 17.9 months; range: 12-39). Follow-up included plain shoulder radiographs and functional assessment with Constant-Murley score. Results: Healing of the fracture Occurred uneventfully within 6 months. In three patients, humeral head collapsed due to aseptic necrosis after fracture healing and the plate had to be removed in two cases. In one patient, fracture healing occurred in >10 degrees varus displacement. The clinical result according to the Constant-Murley score was 86 points (range: 58-112). Conclusions: Internal fixation with the Philos plate seems to be a reliable option in the operative treatment of upper end humeral fractures, especially in osteoporotic bone. It allows secure fracture fixation and quick shoulder mobilisation, while quick and uneventful fracture healing and very satisfactory clinical results are achieved. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of these fractures can be associated with an intraoperative and/ or postoperative maxillo-mandibular fixation (MMF). The aim of this study was to analyse the use of perioperative MMF and its effects on occlusal outcomes in the management of mandibular fractures. Material and methods: This multicentric prospective study included adult patients with mandibular fractures treated with ORIF. The following data were collected: age, gender, pre-trauma dental status (dentate, partially dentate), cause of injury, fracture site, associated facial fractures, surgical approach, type of ORIF (rigid, non-rigid or mixed), thickness and number of plates, modality of intraoperative MMF (arch bars, self-tapping and self-drilling screws [STSDSs], manual, other) and duration of postoperative MMF. The primary outcome was malocclusion at 6 weeks and 3 months. Statistical analyses were performed with Fisher's exact test or chi-square test, as appropriate. Results: Between 1 May 2021 and 30 April 2022, 336 patients, 264 males and 72 females (median age, 28 years) with mandibular fractures (194 single, 124 double and 18 triple fractures) were hospitalized. Intraoperative MMF was performed in all patients. Osteosynthesis was rigid in 75% of single fractures, and rigid or mixed in 85% and 100% of double and triple fractures, respectively. Excluding patients who underwent manual reduction, postoperative MMF (median duration, 3 weeks) was performed in 140 (64%) patients, without differences by type or number of fractures (p > 0.05). No significant difference was found in the incidence of malocclusion in patients with postoperative MMF (5%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 2-10%) compared to those without (4%; 95% IC, 1-11%) (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Postoperative MMF was performed in more than half of the patients despite adequate fracture osteosynthesis, with wide variability amongst centers. No evidence of a reduction in the incidence of postoperative malocclusion in patients treated with postoperative MMF was found. (c) 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

This study sought to determine the effectiveness and outcome of surgical fusion of osteoarthritic second metatarsocuneiform (MC) joint. The association between the condition and second metatarsal length was also explored. Materials and Methods: A series of 23 patients (22 female) of average age 58 years (SD 4.9) underwent second MCJ fusion and were reviewed at an average of 42 months (SD 19.5) postoperatively. The second MC joint fusion involved resection of the joint surfaces and internal fixation with a 3-hole 2.7-mm plate. A variety of graft materials were utilized. Results: The AOFAS midfoot rating scale score rose from a preoperative mean of 47 (SD 13) to a mean 90.5 (SD 12.5) postoperatively, p < 0.0001. Seventeen patients (74%) were completely satisfied. Four patients (17%) were satisfied with reservations. Two patients (9%) were dissatisfied. Twenty-one patients (91%) considered that they were better than before the operation and two patients were no better. Nonunion occurred in three patients and internal fixation was removed in four patients. One patient went onto develop osteoarthrosis in the third MC joint. We could not establish a causal relationship between osteoathrosis of the second MC joint and second metatarsal length. Conclusion: Fusion of the second MCJ is a moderately effective treatment for osteoarthrosis of the joint. In this series of patients, 74% were pain-free and nonunion was the most serious complication encountered, no patient was made worse by surgery.

In fact, conversion of carbon-di-oxide into value aided chemicals is one of the major areas of contemporary research. This versatile material is also capable to catalyze acylation of amines in solvent free condition. The end products of both the reactions i.e. cyclic carbonate and N-acylated amines have huge industrial importance. The pristine ZnO nanomaterial without incorporation of metal nanoparticles, has shown excellent reusability up to five consecutive reaction cycles without considerable loss in its efficiency which is quite encouraging for industrial realization.

It has been well documented that surgical fixation of rib fractures can decrease both morbidity and mortality rates. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a dedicated APS Rib Fixation System, which features a pre-contoured design based on anatomical rib data of the Asian population. Materials and Methods: We reviewed 43 consecutive patients, who underwent surgical stabilization for flail chest with the traditional Mini bone plate (n = 20), APS plate (n = 13), or Mini + APS (n = 10). Demographic and injury variables were documented. We used X-ray radiography to determine plate fractures and screw dislocations after surgical fixation. Results: No statistical differences were noted in the demographic or injury variables. APS plates demonstrated fewer cases of plate fractures and screw dislocations than Mini plates (OR = 0.091, p = 0.008). Conclusions: The pre-contoured design of the APS plate demonstrated a superior rib implant failure rate as compared to the traditional Mini bone plate. Our study indicates that the APS plate may serve as an effective surgical tool for the treatment of flail chest.

The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of freehand technique and of a target device for retrograde calcaneotibial fixation in an uninjured bone and an unstable ankle fracture. Materials and Methods: The calcaneotibial fixation was performed randomly by an experienced surgeon utilizing either a freehand drilling technique or a novel targeting device in four human cadavers before and after producing a bimalleolar ankle fracture. The duration of foot positioning, drilling, number of intensifier shots, and drilling attempts were recorded. The final position of the wire was established using IsoC-3D scan. Results: The mean for definitive wire placement with the target device was 247 sec with a mean of 3.4 attempts, and 92 sec and 2.1 attempts in the freehand technique. Mean intraosseous distance of the K-wire was 45.3 mm and 63.6 mm in the tibia and 39.7 mm and 41.5 mm in the calcaneus respectively. Conclusion: The novel target device for calcaneotibial fixation achieves similar results to a trained surgeon using the freehand technique.

Aim: The aim of this study was to test the safety and efficacy of a newly designed inside-outside occipital (OC) plate system for the treatment of cranio-vertebral junction instability. Material and Methods: Thirty-two patients of CVJ instability were treated using this new OC plate system. Safety and efficacy of this new OC plate was evaluated radiologically and clinically. Results: Follow-up period ranged from 9 to 23 months. During the follow-up, no implant failure, recurrent subluxation, or newly developed instability at adjacent levels occurred, except in one patient in whom C2 screw pullout occurred due to trauma. All patients showed a satisfactory fusion at three months follow-up examination. Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that this OC plate system is a simple, safe, and effective method for providing immediate internal rigid fixation of the CV junction. Long-term results are needed to determine the superiority of this OC plate over other methods of occipital fixation.

Design-optimization and material selection for a femoral-fracture fixation-plate implant	MATERIALS & DESIGN			English	Article						Musculoskeletal modeling and simulations; Femoral-fracture fixed-plate implant; Optimization	INTERNAL-FIXATION; JOINT FORCES; MECHANISM; LUMBAR; SYSTEM; MUSCLE; MODEL	The problem of size/thickness optimization of a distal femoral-fracture fixation-plate is addressed computationally using a combined finite-element/design-optimization procedure. To obtain realistic physiological loading conditions associated with normal living activities (cycling, in the present case), a musculoskeletal multi-body inverse-dynamics analysis is carried out of a human riding the bicycle. While optimizing the design of the femoral-fracture locking-plate, realistic functional requirements pertaining to attain the required level of fracture-femur fixation and longevity/lifecycle were used. It is argued that these types of analysis should be used to complement pre-clinical implant-evaluation tests, the tests which normally include a limited number of physiological loading conditions and single pass/fail outcomes/decisions with respect to a set of lower-bound implant performance criteria.

Materials and Methods: Two groups were created from twenty-four humeri. Group 1 was instrumented using a new, precontoured, 8-hole (3.5-mm-diameter) locking compression plate (LCP) placed anterolaterally. Group 2 was instrumented using an 8-hole (3.5-mm-diameter) precontoured posterolateral LCP plate placed on the distal humerus. Four-point bending tests and torsion tests were performed until the specimens broke. Results: The four-point bending stiffness test showed that the stiffness of anterolaterally fixed humeri was significantly higher than that of posterolaterally fixed humeri (p<0.05). Torsion testing revealed that posterolateral fixation was associated with better yield strength (p<0.05), but the torsional stiffness did not differ significantly between the two plates (p>0.05). Conclusions: The anterolateral plate exhibited higher bending stiffness and torsional yield strength than the posterolateral plate. Anterolateral plate fixation can thus be used to manage extra-articular distal humeral fractures. Multiaxial locking screws ensure rigid fixation, allow early elbow motion without olecranon fossa impingement, and prevent iatrogenic injury of the triceps muscle.

In the process of combining magnesium and PLA, the magnesium powder is pre-treated with fluorine conversion, that is, the surface of the magnesium powder would form a fluoride membrane, and then it is compounded with PLA to form Mg-F-PA. In the experiment, the morphology of the material is analyzed first. Magnesium powder and magnesium fluoride powder are evenly dispersed on the surface of the composite material, and the surface of the composite material is relatively flat. At the same time, it is found in the mechanical analysis that the mechanical strength of composite Mg-F-PA decreases compared with that of single PLA, but the binding force of magnesium fluoride powder+ PLA is stronger than that of magnesium powder+ PLA. 120 patients with lower extremity fractures of ASA I similar to III are selected and divided into 4 groups, with 30 cases in each group. These patients are treated with hip replacement (group 1), artificial femoral head replacement (group 2), open reduction and internal fixation for lower limb fractures (group 3), open reduction and internal fixation for lower limb fractures+ Mg-F-PA (group 4). Then, postoperative evaluation is conducted. The clinical results show that the group 4 is better than the other 3 groups in terms of the sedation degree score, the number of pain pump presses and the incidence of postoperative adverse reactions (P < 0.05). Therefore, the orthopedic material that proposed in this study can reduce postoperative pain.

Functional assessment of transplantar nailing for ankle fracture in the elderly: 48 weeks' prospective follow-up of 14 patients	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Ankle fracture; Elderly; Osteoporotic fracture; Weight-bearing; Transplantar nail	FRAGILITY FRACTURES; CALCANEOTALOTIBIAL NAIL; OPERATIVE TREATMENT; EARLY WEIGHTBEARING; FIXATION; MANAGEMENT; SURGERY; AGE	Introduction: Retrograde transplantar intramedullary nailing (TIMN) is a recently described option for ankle fracture in elderly patients with multiple comorbidity contraindicating classical internal fixation. The main objective of the present study was to assess mobility after TIMN for ankle fracture in the elderly. The secondary objective was to assess complications. Hypothesis: Retrograde TIMN provides reliable fixation of ankle fracture in the elderly, enabling early resumption of walking. Material and methods: Fourteen patients, with a mean age of 79.6 years (range: 65-99 years), with fracture of the ankle or tibial pilon treated by retrograde TIMN, were prospectively included over a 1-year period (2014-2016). Full weight-bearing with walking cast boot was authorized as of day 1. Mobility was assessed on Parker score in consultation at 6, 12, 24 and 48 weeks. Results: Ten patients were followed up. Mean Parker score was 3.6 (range: 1-5) preoperatively, and 2.4 (range: 1-5) and 2.7 (range: 1-5) at 24 and 48 weeks, respectively: i.e., not significantly different from preoperative values (p = 0.057 and p = 0.054, respectively). There were no decubitus-related complications. Two patients (20%) showed other complications, including 1 deep infection requiring material ablation. Consolidation was systematic, without hindfoot malunion. Discussion: Retrograde TIMN appeared to be a useful option for ankle fracture in elderly patients for whom classical internal fixation was contraindicated. It allowed immediate resumption of weight-bearing and early rehabilitation, with no increased morbidity or mortality. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

J	Pitjamit, S; Nakkiew, W				Pitjamit, Siwasit; Nakkiew, Wasawat			Fatigue Analysis Model for Applying Bioglass-Hydroxyapatite Biocomposite LCP Bone Fixation Plates to Fix Humeral Shaft Fractures	CHIANG MAI JOURNAL OF SCIENCE			English	Article						locking compression plate; hydroxyapatite; bioglass; fatigue life; finite element analysis; bone fixation; bioceramic	FINITE-ELEMENT-ANALYSIS; BIOACTIVE GLASS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; TAPE CAST; BIOCOMPATIBILITY; CRYSTALLIZATION; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; DEGRADATION; COMPOSITES; STRENGTH	Generally, there are several methods to treat patients who suffer from humerus fractures caused by accidents, such as internal fixation, external fixation, and a nail system. Bone fixation with locking compression plates (LCPs), one of the most famous internal fixation methods, is used to treat humerus shaft fractures. However, cracks and fractures can occur on the plate before the humerus fracture is completely rejoined, in which case the patient needs another surgery. There were two main purposes for this research: one was to find suitable forming conditions of LCPs synthesized from biomaterials, and the second was to obtain a suitable fixation method using LCPs. For the former, hydroxyapatite powder from bovine bone was synthesized, and bioactive glass powder from mollusk shell was prepared with chemical reactions. The materials were blended and ground with a high-speed ball milling machine to reduce and thoroughly mix them before forming the proposed materials. A hydraulic pressing machine was then used to compress the formed composites. The Taguchi experimental design was used to evaluate essential factors of forming conditions, such as sintering temperature, compacting pressure, mixing ratio, and holding time for pressing. The results demonstrate that a ratio of bioactive glass to hydroxyapatite of 30:70 wt%, 30 MPa compacting pressure, and 5000 degrees C sintering temperature provided the highest compressive and bending strength of 249.46 MPa and 29.16 MPa, respectively. The bulk density of the specimen was 3.16 g/cm(3), and the biomaterials, tested by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) analysis, can be used on the human body since it they are biodegradable in 3980 days, which is long enough for bone healing. For the second purpose, the S-N curve of the specimen was obtained via experiment and then used to create a finite element model of bone fixation using LCPs. Important factors of fracture gap, number of screws on the plate, and axial compression force were considered in finding suitable bone fixation conditions in the finite element model. Based on the response surface method (RSM), the results of statistically significant factors showed that the axial compression force was 182 N by using six screws, resulting in the greatest fatigue life. The results of this paper could assist orthopedic surgeons in understanding the biomechanical efficiency of bone fixation using LCPs. In addition, surgeons can select a fixation technique based on the patient's condition using the numerical results from this study.

To identify the survival and standardized mortality ratio with respect to gender, age, and treatment method of patients treated for femoral neck fractures. Material and Methods. A retrospective review of medical records of 736 patients treated for femoral neck fractures at Vilnius University Emergency Hospital during 2004-2006 was carried out. Results. The overall 1- and 2-year survival rates were 77.4% and 67.1%, respectively. Lower survival rates were observed in the internal fixation group than in the primary and secondary total hip arthroplasty groups (63.2% vs. 72.0% and 75.1%). Cox proportional hazards model analysis showed patient age to be a significant risk factor for survival (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CL 1.04-1.07: P<0.001). The overall standardized mortality ratio was 2.50. The standardized mortality ratios for men and women were 3.07 and 2.27, respectively, but the difference between these groups was not significant. Conclusions. Standardized mortality and survival rates decreased with increasing patients' age. Significantly lower survival rates were documented in the internal fixation group as compared with primary and secondary total hip arthroplasty groups. There was a trend toward a higher standardized mortality ratio in men than women, but the difference was not significant.

Internal fixation of canine coccygeal vertebral fractures: four cases (2018-2022)	JOURNAL OF SMALL ANIMAL PRACTICE			English	Article							POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS; TAIL INJURIES; DOGS; INFECTIONS; AMPUTATION; DOCKING	Objectives: To describe the surgical technique and evaluate the outcome and complications after coccygeal vertebral fracture repair in dogs using internal fixation. Materials and Methods: Medical records and radiography of client-owned dogs were reviewed retrospectively. A lateral approach to the vertebral body was used, and a 1.5 or 1.0 mm plate was applied laterally. Initial follow-up included clinical and radiographic assessment at 6 to 8 weeks postoperatively. Short-term follow-up was assessed by the completion of an adapted functional questionnaire by owners. Results: Four dogs presented with mid-vertebral body fractures. The neurological function of the tail was preserved, and fracture repair was performed in all cases. One dog developed a surgical site infection, which was successfully treated with antimicrobial therapy. One dog experienced prolonged postoperative pain and delayed union. Fracture healing occurred in all patients at the final follow-up. Neither discomfort nor reduced function or mobility of the tails was noticed during the postoperative patient assessment. The questionnaire was completed by all owners with a mean follow-up time of 40 weeks. Excellent outcomes were established from subsequent clinical reviews and owner questionnaires, related to their dog's activity and comfort levels. Clinical Significance: Excellent outcomes can be achieved following the repair of coccygeal vertebral fractures in dogs using internal fixation, including a return to normal function of the tail.

Design: Retrospective chart and operation note review. Setting: A medical college-affiliated tertiary hospital. Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart and radiographic review of posterolateral tibial plateau fractures treated with a posterolateral approach between January 2006 and July 2010 was performed. The primary (ie, the total Rasmussen function score) and secondary (ie, the postoperative infection, knee deformity, and complications) outcomes were analyzed. Results: A total of 32 patients were identified for this study. Patients were followed for an average of 18.2 months (range, 12-36 months); the total Rasmussen function score was 24.8 +/- 2.9 points. The results were rated as excellent (>= 27 points) in 19 patients, good (20-26 points) in 11, and fair (10-19 points) in 2 patients. No wound infections, screw loosening or implant fracture, and nonunion, deformity, or fracture redisplacement were seen. Stretch injury of the common peroneal nerve was found in 1 patient, who obtained recovery 2 months after additional conservative management. Conclusions: Adequate open reduction and internal fixation with a fibula osteotomy-free posterolateral approach can attain a satisfactory clinical outcome for patients with posterolateral tibial plateau fractures.

Materials and methods Our study included postarthroscopic MRI studies from 58 children (mean age at arthroscopy, 13.8 + 2.1 years) who have undergone bioabsorbable nail fixation of unstable osteochondral lesions between February 1, 2011 and September 30, 2017. All studies were retrospectively reviewed for broken nails, intra-articular debris, and internal knee derangement. Demographic information and information pertaining to active symptoms was obtained from both MRI questionnaire that was completed at the time of the study and clinical note that preceded the study. Marginal logistic regression models estimated using generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to identify factors associated with a broken nail and joint effusion. Results A total of 104 postoperative studies were reviewed, which included 60 with symptoms and 44 without symptoms. Nail breakage was present in 38 (36.6%) studies and associated with presence of symptoms (OR 2.43, p = 0.036) and effusion (OR 2.76, p = 0.025). An effusion was present in 40 (38.5%) studies which decreased with increasing time from treatment (OR 0.89, p = 0.007) and increased with symptoms (OR 10.87, p < 0.001). Meniscal tear was present on 8 (7.7%) and chondral irregularity on 14 (13.5%) studies. Conclusion Broken nail, effusion, and less commonly, meniscal tears and chondral irregularity, are all complications that can arise following fixation of osteochondral lesions with bioabsorbable nails. MRI can serve as a valuable tool in assessing these complications.

Laminaria digitata was chosen due to its importance as a model organism in a wide range of biological studies, as a keystone species on rocky shores of the North Atlantic, its use of iodide as a unique inorganic antioxidant, and its significance as a raw material for the production of alginate. Details of the fine structural features of vegetative cells are described, with particular emphasis on the differences between the two methods used, i.e. conventional chemical fixation and freeze-fixation. The general structure of the cells was similar to that already described, with minor differences between the different cell types. An intense activity of the Golgi system was found associated with the thick external cell wall, with large dictyosomes from which numerous vesicles and cisternae are released. An interesting type of cisternae was found in the cryofixed material, which was not visible with the chemical fixation. These are elongated structures, in sections appearing tubule-like, close to the external cell wall or to young internal walls. An increased number of these structures was observed near the plasmodesmata of the pit fields. They are similar to the "flat cisternae" found associated with the forming cytokinetic diaphragm of brown algae. Their possible role is discussed. The new findings of this work underline the importance of such combined studies which reveal new data not known until now using the old conventional methods. The main conclusion of the present study is that cryofixation is the method of choice for studying Laminaria cytology by transmission electron microscopy.

Materials and methods: 137 patients with dual-bone forearm fractures (48 patients in the D-ESIN group, 45 patients in the hybrid group, and 44 patients in the D-plate group) were reviewed. Duration of surgery, length of incision, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative times of fluoroscopy, and duration of postoperative immobilisation were recorded. Radiographic outcomes, functional outcomes, and complication rate were also recorded. Results:Surgeries and incisions were significantly shorter, and less intraoperative blood loss occurred, in the hybrid group than the D-plate group (P < 0.001). The hybrid group was also characterised by less intraoperative fluoroscopy times and shorter duration of postoperative immobilisation compared with the D-ESIN group (P < 0.001). The union rate of the ulna at 3 months postoperatively was higher in the hybrid and D-plate groups than in the D-ESIN group (P = 0.003). The union rate of the radius was similar in all three groups (P = 0.403). No significant difference in the union rate of the radius or ulna was observed among groups at 6 months postoperatively (P = 0.052). The mean union time was notably later in the D-ESIN group than in the hybrid and D-plate groups. However, no significant difference in functional outcome or complication rate was observed among the three groups (P = 0.822 and P = 0.912). Conclusion: Hybrid fixation was superior in terms of the duration of surgery, intraoperative use of fluoroscopy, intraoperative blood loss, duration of postoperative immobilisation, delayed union of the ulna, and bone union time. Therefore, hybrid fixation is a safe and effective treatment for dual-bone forearm fractures in children aged 10-16 years.

JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							MAXILLOFACIAL FRACTURES; CONDYLAR FRACTURES; PLATING TECHNIQUES; RESORBABLE PLATES; FACIAL FRACTURES; TITANIUM; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; EXPERIENCE; REMOVAL; SURGERY	Purpose: To investigate whether biodegradable plates are applicable in endoscope-assisted open reduction and internal fixation (EAORIF) of mandibular subcondyle fractures. Materials and Methods: This retrospective case-series study included patients with mandibular subcondyle fractures treated with EAORIF using an unsintered hydroxyapatite particles/poly-L-lactide biodegradable plate system, with at least 6 months of clinical follow-up data available. The outcome variables were fracture healing with postoperative stability and postoperative complications. Other variables included age, gender, fracture site, cause of injury, accompanying mandibular fracture, total follow-up period, fracture classification, extent of displacement, preoperative status of occlusion, preoperative mandibular movements, fixation materials in accompanying mandibular fracture, location and number of fixation plates, periods of intermaxillary fixation/elastic bands, and postoperative mandibular movements. Fracture healing in these patients was assessed by comparing the immediate postoperative cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images with those obtained at least 3 months after surgery. Results: A total of 11 patients, 9 male and 2 female, with a mean +/- standard deviation age of 35.3 +/- 15.9 years, were included. The mean follow-up period was 18.8 +/- 7.8 months. Four patients had an accompanying mandibular fracture. Two 4-hole, 2.0-mm biodegradable plates were fixed with 6-mm screws along the posterior border of the mandibular ramus and near the sigmoid notch. Complete bone formation around the fracture lines or fading of the fracture lines, with no change in the position of the fractured segments, was observed on the postoperative CBCT images at 3 months. With the exception of 2 patients, no patient complained of plate palpability, deviation in occlusion, or discomfort during the postoperative follow-up period. Conclusions: EAORIF using biodegradable plates for mandible subcondylar fractures is a stable and reliable method, with considerable advantages compared with titanium plates.

Is Bone Grafting Unnecessary in the Treatment of Cystic Scaphoid Pseudoarthrosis?	ACTA CHIRURGIAE ORTHOPAEDICAE ET TRAUMATOLOGIAE CECHOSLOVACA			English	Article						scaphoid bone; nonunion; fracture fixation; internal; bone grafting; bone screws	PERCUTANEOUS SCREW FIXATION; NONUNION; WAIST	PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The basic aim of the treatment of cystic nonunion is to provide stable fixation and mechanical compression to increase union, but there is no consensus on whether to perform bone grafting in the cystic area or not. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical and radiological results of patients with cystic scaphoid non-union who received open grafting, and internal fixation and those treated with percutaneous fixation without grafting. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective evaluation was made of patients included those determined radiologically with Slade and Dodds grade IV scaphoid cystic non-union. Two different surgical procedures were performed. Percutaneous screw fixation was carried out on the patients in group 1. Open curettage-grafting and screw fixation were performed on the patients in group 2. Group 1 was comprised of 16 patients treated with percutaneous screw fixation, and group 2 was comprised of 17 patients who had open curettage-grafting and screw fixation. RESULTS In the radiological evaluation at the final follow-up examination, union was determined in 12 of the 16 (75%) patients in group 1 and 15 of the 17 (88%) patients in group 2. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of union, functional outcomes and complication rates. DISCUSSION In the current study, the union rate was higher in the patients who had open curettage-grafting and fixation with a headless screw (88%) than in those with percutaneous screw without grafting (75%), but the difference was not determined to be statistically significant. The union rate of the group that received grafting was similar to the rates reported in the literature. CONCLUSIONS We think that both of these techniques may be successfully used for cystic scaphoid nonunions but percutaneous technique should be preferred as it is minimally invasive. Nevertheless, there is a need for further prospective, randomised studies with larger series to have better comparisons.	[Zengin, E.

Materials and methods Horizontal oblique metacarpal shaft fractures were created in 21 artificial metacarpal bones and fixed using one of the three methods: (1) two lag screws, (2) a regular plate, and (3) a locking plate. All the specimens were subjected to the cantilever bending test performed using a material testing machine to enable recording of the force-displacement data of the specimens before failure. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare failure force and stiffness values among the three fixation methods. Results The mean failure force of the two lag screw group (78.5 +/- 6.6 N, mean + SD) was higher than those of the regular plate group (69.3 +/- 17.6 N) and locking plate group (68.2 +/- 14.2 N). However, the mean failure force did not significantly differ among the three groups. The mean stiffness value of the two lag screw group (17.8 +/- 2.6 N/mm) was lower than those of the regular plate group (20.2 +/- 10.5 N/mm) and locking plate group (21.8 +/- 3.8 N/mm). However, the mean stiffness value did not significantly differ among the three groups. Conclusion The fixation strength of two lag screw fixation did not significantly differ from that of regular and locking bone plate fixation, as indicated by the measurement of the ability to sustain force and stiffness.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of PRP in management of femoral neck fractures. Materials and methods: This study included 64 cases in PRP group and 64 cases in control group. After clinical evaluation, patients in control group only underwent closed reduction and internal fixation and patients in PRP group received addition of PRP to internal fixation. Results: Mean length of hospital stay was 13.7 days in the PRP group and 18.1 days in the control group, which was found significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.042). Similarly, the PRP group obtained a shorter union time, compared to the control group (P = 0.005). No statistically significant differences were observed in functional outcomes regards HHS or VAS between the 2 groups (Table 2). There was no difference in the presence of complications (P > 0.05) using Fisher's exact test. Conclusions: Although no differences in functional outcomes were observed between the groups, PRP could obtain a decreased hospital stay and bone union time.

We hypothesized that fixation devices made with degradable magnesium alloys could provide an ideal combination of strength and degradation, facilitating fracture fixation and healing while eliminating the need for implant removal surgery. Materials and Methods: Fixation plates and screws were machined from 99.9% pure magnesium and compared with titanium devices in a rabbit ulnar fracture model. Magnesium device degradation and the effect on fracture healing and bone formation were assessed after 4 weeks. Fracture healing with magnesium device fixation was compared with that of titanium devices using qualitative histologic analysis and quantitative histomorphometry. Results: Micro-computed tomography showed device degradation after 4 weeks in vivo. In addition, 2-dimensional micro-computed tomography slices and histologic staining showed that magnesium degradation did not inhibit fracture healing or bone formation. Histomorphology showed no difference in bone-bridging fractures fixed with magnesium and titanium devices. Interestingly, abundant new bone was formed around magnesium devices, suggesting a connection between magnesium degradation and bone formation. Conclusion: Our results show potential for magnesium fixation devices in a loaded fracture environment. Furthermore, these results suggest that magnesium fixation devices may enhance fracture healing by encouraging localized new bone formation.

With the aid of a co-catalyst, a satisfactory selectivity (similar to 100%) and activity (99.2%) for the synthesis of 1,2-butylene carbonate were obtained on COF-366-Zn under mild reaction conditions. Their great recyclability and adaptability for various substrates were also demonstrated. The excellent performance may be benefited from their unique 2D COF structure and the facilitation effects on central metalloporphyrin sites from the internal environment of COFs.

J	Desai, S; Jain, R; Singh, V				Desai, Sanjay; Jain, Rohit; Singh, Vishwajeet			Results of an innovative method of intramedullary fixation for displaced 4-part fractures of the proximal humerus in patients younger than 70 years	JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY			English	Article						Displaced; four part; proximal; humerus; fractures; innovative; intramedullary; fixation	LOCKING PLATE FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; INTERNAL-FIXATION; HEMIARTHROPLASTY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; COMPLICATIONS; MALPOSITION; OUTCOMES; FAILURE	Background: The management of displaced 4-part fractures of proximal humerus is a challenge, as it is difficult to produce consistently good results with the current methods of fixation. Varus collapse of the head and eventual failure of plate fixation have been reported in up to 45% of cases. We present an innovative method of intramedullary fixation for displaced 4-part proximal humeral fractures. The aim of this study was to present the results of an intramedullary fixation device used for displaced 4-part proximal humeral fractures in patients younger than 70 years. Materials and methods: Fixation was performed with an intramedullary device in 30 patients with an average age of 56 years who had displaced 4-part proximal humeral fractures. The device consists of a circular staple that is impacted in the head and engages into the neck of an intramedullary uncemented stem. The stem has a sleeve that provides the ability to adjust the height and thereby facilitates accurate reduction of the tuberosity with ease. Fracture union was assessed with plain radiographs, and clinical outcomes were assessed using American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons and Constant scores. Results: Union was achieved in 93.33% of patients and the mean American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons and Constant scores were 75.2 and 73.97, respectively, at an average follow-up of 25.83 months. None of the patients had tuberosity avulsion, tuberosity nonunion, or resorption. However, 2 patients had humeral head nonunion and 2 had avascular necrosis. Revision surgery was performed in 2 patients (6.67%), because of avascular necrosis in 1 and nonunion in 1. Conclusion: In patients younger than 70 years with displaced 4-part proximal humeral fractures, the described intramedullary device provides a simple and reproducible method of internal fixation with predictable tuberosity union and shoulder function.

The anatomical restoration of the joint can be performed either with elevation through a cortical window, through balloon-guided osteoplasty or direct visualisation of the articular surface. Structural support of the void created in the subchondral area can be achieved through the use of bone graft materials (autologous tricortical bone), or synthetic bone graft substitutes. In the present study, we describe the available techniques and materials that can be used in treating impacted osteochondral fragments with special consideration of their epidemiology and treatment options.

The purpose of this study is to investigate how the material properties of spinal fixation rods influence the biomechanical behavior at the instrumented and adjacent levels through the use of the finite element method. Methods Five finite element models were constructed in our study to simulate the human spine pre- and post-surgery. For the four post-surgical models, the spines were implanted with rods made of three different materials: (i) titanium rod, (ii) PEEK rod with interbody PEEK cage, (iii) Biodegradable rod with interbody PEEK cage, and (iv) PEEK cage without pedicle screw fixation (no rods). Results Fusion of the lumbar spine using PEEK or biodegradable rods allowed a similar ROM at both the fusion and adjacent levels under all conditions. The models with PEEK and biodegradable rods also showed a similar increase in contact forces at adjacent facet joints, but both were less than the model with a titanium rod. Conclusions Flexible rods or cages with non-instrumented fusion can mitigate the increased contact forces on adjacent facet joints typically found following spinal fixation, and could also reduce the level of stress shielding at the bone graft.

However, the development of osteosynthesis systems made of poly(alpha-hydroxy acid) polymers has been hindered by the lack of information on the mechanical properties and biocompatibility of these materials. Moreover, magnesium-based degredable osteosynthesis materials have not yet been integrated into clinical practice owing to biocompatibility problems. Osteosynthesis systems made from nonresorbable titanium alloys have shown excellent biocompatibility, stability and individual fitting to the implant bed, so these materials are currently considered the 'gold standard'. The procedure of plate removal has been subjected to intense scrutiny and controversy. Bioresorbable materials are indicated for special conditions, such as osteosynthesis of the growing skull or orbital floor reconstructions. This paper presents an overview of the currently available and investigated resorbable osteosynthesis materials in comparison with the nonresorbable 'gold standard' titanium. The main problem areas such as sterilization, biocompatibility and stability are highlighted and perspectives for further improvements are provided. Copyright (C) 2013 S.

As an initial step for developing bone internal fixation materials, the biological evaluation of poly-l-lactic acid/bioactive glass (PLLA/BG) composite in vitro and in vivo, including the hemolysis test, pyrogen test, acute systemic toxicity test, genetic toxicity test, anaphylaxis test, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) test, direct cell culture and in vivo implant experiment, was performed. The results indicated that PLLA/BG composite showed no acute systemic toxicity, genetic toxicity, anaphylaxis reaction, and pyrogen reaction, and the hemolysis ratio was 0.39%. MTT assay indicated that no cytotoxic effect was observed for the PLLA/BG composite, and in addition, a significant increase in cellular activity compared to the negative control group was found. Excellent adhesion between fibroblast and PLLA/BG material was observed, the fibroblasts cultured on the PLLA/BG composite substrates revealed a higher proliferation and differentiation rate than those on the pure PLLA substrates. In vivo implant experiment showed that the PLLA/BG composite could maintain the mechanical properties during the course of fracture therapy, and the malleolar fracture of rabbits was healed in 8 weeks on the whole. Therefore, PLLA/BG composites have a promising biological response as a potential implant material.

Class III atrophic mandibular models were constructed using three-dimensional finite element models. After simulation of fracture on the left side, plates with different thicknesses (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 mm) were adapted to the models and three locking screws on each side of the fracture were used for fixation. Titanium alloy and CFR-PEEK material properties were assessed for all plate models. Von Mises stress values decreased gradually with an increase in plate profile thickness. Von Mises stress values for screws and plates were lower in models using CFR-PEEK plates. An increase in plate profile enhanced the load-sharing performance of the fixation systems, with rigid titanium alloy plates sharing the load among the screws more evenly. 1.0 mm, 1.5 mm, and 2.0 mm CFR-PEEK plates produced strain values of 2-10%, which promote proper healing via formation of callus in the fracture line. In terms of investigated biomechanical parameters, and with a Young's modulus similar to that of cortical bone, CFR-PEEK materials appear to be suitable for the treatment of atrophic mandibular fractures.

A comparison of fixation methods in adolescent patients with diaphyseal forearm fractures	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Adolescent; Both-bone forearm fracture; Intramedullary nailing; Open reduction; Internal fixation; Pediatrics	PLATE FIXATION; INTRAMEDULLARY FIXATION; COMPLICATIONS; OUTCOMES; CHILDREN; BONES	Introduction: The purpose of this study was to compare both bone diaphyseal forearm fractures in adolescent patients treated with plate fixation to patients treated with intramedullary fixation to identify differences in complications and outcomes. Materials &methods: A retrospective study was performed on all adolescent patients with age between 10 and 16 year and treated with intramedullary fixation or plate fixation for a diaphyseal both bone forearm fracture between 2005 and 2014. Demographic information and clinical data was collected. Radiographs were reviewed to evaluate post-operative radial bow magnitude and location, time to union, and residual angulation. Complications were graded using the modified Clavien-Dindo Classification system. Results: A total of 102 patients met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 32 were treated with plate fixation and 70 with intramedullary fixation. The intramedullary nail group had 55% of complications classified as major. There were no major complications in the plate fixation group (P = 0.1). The radial bow was significantly more distal and smaller in magnitude in the intramedullary fixation group (P <0.01). Of the patients who underwent intramedullary fixation, 76% required an open reduction of at least one forearm bone. There was increased time to radiographic union in patients treated with intramedullary fixation when compared to those treated with plates, 68 days versus 58 days (P = 0.03). A second operation was necessary for 91% of patients treated with intramedullary fixation compared to only 3% of patients treated with a plate (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Diaphyseal forearm fractures in adolescent patients remain challenging injuries to treat. Forearm bony anatomy is not completely restored with intramedullary fixation. Results suggested an association towards increased complication rates and complication severity with intramedullary fixation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Despite providing strong fixation strength, plate fixation has numerous shortcomings. Concerning internal fixation with Kirschner wires (K-wires), although this approach is frequently used to treat metacarpal shaft fractures, the lack of functional stability may result in fixation failure. Objective To evaluate the effect of figure-of-eight cerclage wire on fixation for transverse metacarpal shaft fractures using two K-wires. Materials and methods We used a saw blade to create transverse metacarpal shaft fractures in 14 fourth-generation artificial third metacarpal bones (Sawbones, Vashon, WA, USA), which were assigned to groups undergoing fixation with two K-wires (KP) or with two K-wires and figure-of-eight cerclage wire (KP&F8). All specimens were subjected to material testing, specifically cantilever bending tests. The maximum fracture force and stiffness of the two fixation types were determined on the basis of the force-displacement data. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare between-group differences in maximum fracture force and stiffness. Results The maximum fracture force of the KP group (median +/- interquartile range = 97.30 +/- 29.70 N) was significantly lower than that of the KP&F8 group (153.2 +/- 69.50 N, p < 0.05; Figure 5a), with the median of the KP&F8 group exceeding that of the KP group by 57.5%. Similarly, stiffness was significantly lower in the KP group (18.14 +/- 9.84 N/mm) than in the KP&F8 group (38.25 +/- 23.49 N/mm; p < 0.05; Figure 5b), with the median of the KP&F8 group exceeding that of the KP group by 110.9%. Conclusion The incorporation of a figure-of-eight cerclage wire increased the maximum fracture force and stiffness by 57.5 and 110.9%, respectively, compared with those achieved in standard two K-wire fixation. Therefore, hand surgeons are advised to consider the proposed approach to increase fixation strength.

New way to obtain the poly(L-lactide-<i>co</i>-D,L-lactide) blend filled with nanohydroxyapatite as biomaterial for 3D-printed bone-reconstruction implants	EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL			English	Article						Poly(L-lactide-co-D; L-lactide); Nanohydroxyapatite; Biocomposite; Co-rotating twin-screw extrusion; Bone-fixation material	SURFACE FREE-ENERGY; L-LACTIC ACID; STAPHYLOCOCCUS-EPIDERMIDIS; PSEUDOMONAS-AERUGINOSA; WETTABILITY; COMPOSITES; FIXATION; CRYSTALLIZATION; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; NANOCOMPOSITES	A novel, bone-reconstruction dedicated polymeric-nanohydroxyapatite material has been prepared for 3D printed implant. The composites of poly(L-lactide-co-D,L-lactide) (PLDLLA) and nanosized hydroxyapatite were prepared by a co-rotating twin-screw extrusion. Structural properties of the filler and polymeric blends were characterized by XRD (X-ray Powder Diffraction), SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy), and EDS mapping (energy dispersive spectroscopy), FT-IR (Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy), and NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) technics. Molar masses of the composites at various preparation steps were also investigated. The structural studies and thermogravimetric analysis proved a successful preparation of the nanohydroxyapatite and its nanocomposites. Mechanical results in conjunction with density values, reported as close to human bone, evidenced usability of this novel material for internal bone fixation implant. Contact angle analysis showed favored growth of tissue on the biocomposite containing 10 wt% of the filler. The PLDLLA-based composite can be an excellent candidate for bone reconstruction implants due to their superior mechanical properties, bioactivity, and complete resorbability.

Methods: :All 28 patients (between January 2013 and June 2018) were treated with lumbar pedicle screw fixation combined with posterior intervertebral fusion. The clinical data and imaging materials of these patients were retrospectively analyzed. Results: :The mean follow-up period was 24.3 months (12-36 months). The average VAS score and JOA score were significantly improved after surgery, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The last follow-up X-ray showed that 16 cases were degree 0 and 12 cases were degree I according to Meyerding grading, which were statistically improved compared with preoperative. Postoperative CT indicated lumbar internal fixation well, and the lumbar fusion rate was 100%. The Frankel grading of neurological function was significantly improved compared with preoperative. Conclusion: :Acute traumatic lumbar spondylolisthesis is caused by severe trauma and mostly occurred at L4/L5 and L5/S1 level. Early posterior reduction, decompression and intervertebral fusion can achieve satisfactory clinical and radiological outcome. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nearly all polytrauma patients and even those with isolated FMF are managed under general anesthesia for definitive management. We propose the use of regional nerve blocks as a safe and effective means for open reduction and fixation of isolated FMF. Aim and Objectives: The aim is to evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness and safety of base of skull maxillomandibular and distal trigeminal nerve blocks in the management of FMF. Materials and Methods: Ten young adults with fractures of the zygoma, mandible and Le Fort I/II injuries were included in the study. Patients with associated craniocervical and abdominothoracic injuries were excluded. Results: The patients' ages ranged from 21 to 40 years, with a mean time of onset of anesthesia being 5 to 12 minutes and total duration of 105 to 220 minutes. Supplementary block for patchy anesthesia was needed in three. All underwent unhindered surgery without complication. Conclusion: Base of skull maxillary-mandibular and distal trigeminal blocks are an effective and efficient alternative to general anesthesia for the open reduction and internal fixation of FMF.

The most common operative treatments of these fractures are open reduction and internal fixation. The incidents and types of complications associated with the use of these operations have not been studied in detail. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study documenting types of complications and their occurrence in a group of patients who received open reduction and internal fixation. Our definition of a complication was a case in which the patient had one or more complications which required an operation, or suffered from complex regional pain syndrome, or skin healing problems lasting more than four weeks from the operation. RESULTS: A total of 165 patients were included. In all, 39 complications in 30 wrists were registered: i.e. 18% had a minimum of one complication. CONCLUSION: Our finding that 18% suffer from a serious complication when treated using a volar locking plate must be taken into consideration when surgeons choose between conservative or operative treatment for DRF treatment. A few other studies have looked at the incidents of complications and have reported similar results.

Material and Methods Plates of stainless steel, titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V), or CF-PEEK with different carbon fiber reinforcement ratios (CF30, CF50, and CF60) were used to fix the tibial shaft comminuted fracture. The maximum stress, the maximum displacement of fracture and the stress shielding of cortex bone were analyzed. Results Under 200 N axial compression, the maximum displacement was measured in the CF30 plate (4.62 mm) and the minimum in the stainless steel plate (0.23 mm). The stress shielding rates of stainless steel, titanium, CF30, CF50, and CF60 plates were 59.4%, 54.4%, 23.75%, 48.75% and 66.25%. Under 700 N axial compression, the internal fixation by the CF30 plate failed. Among the other 4 plates, the maximum displacement was measured in the CF50 plate (2.52 mm) and the minimum in the stainless steel plate (0.78 mm). The stress shielding rate of plates made of stainless steel, titanium, CF50, and CF60 were 57.1%, 52.0%, 48.1%, and 67.8%. Conclusions CF50 plates can be safely used in the tibial shaft comminuted fracture. The micromotion in the CF50 and CF60 plate was more beneficial to callus formation and fracture healing. The stress shielding of the cortex bone under the CF50 plate was the lowest. The finite element analysis indicated that the CF-PEEK material is worthy of further study because of its biomechanical advantages.

Three year follow-up from a prospective study	BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS			English	Article						Tibial plateau fracture; Surgical treatment; Bone graft; Ceramic injectable biphasic bone substitute; Clinical and radiographic outcome	CALCIUM-PHOSPHATE CEMENT; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; GRAFT	Background: Reduction of tibial plateau fractures and maintain a level of well aligned congruent joint is key to a satisfactory clinical outcome and is important for the return to pre-trauma level of activity. Stable internal fixation support early mobility and weight bearing. The augmentation with bone graft substitute is often required to support the fixation to mantain reduction. For these reasons there has been development of novel bone graft substitutes for trauma applications and in particular synthetic materials based on calcium phosphates and/or apatite combined with calcium sulfates. Injectable bone substitutes can optimize the filling of irregular bone defects. The purpose of this study was to assess the potential of a novel injectable bone substitute CERAMENT (TM)vertical bar BONE VOID FILLER in supporting the initial reduction and preserving alignment of the joint surface until fracture healing. Methods: From June 2010 through May 2011 adult patients presenting with acute, closed and unstable tibial plateau fractures which required both grafting and internal fixation, were included in a prospective study with percutaneous or open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) augmented with an injectable ceramic biphasic bone substitute CERAMENT (TM)vertical bar BONE VOID FILLER (BONESUPPORT (TM), Lund, Sweden) to fill residual voids. Clinical follow up was performed at 1, 3, 9 and 12 months and any subsequent year; including radiographic analysis and Rasmussen system for knee functional grading. Results: Twenty four patients, balanced male-to-female, with a mean age of 47 years, were included and followed with an average of 44 months (range 41-52 months). Both Schatzker and Muller classifications were used and was type II or 41-B3 in 7 patients, type III or 41-B2 in 12 patients, type IV or 41-C1 in 2 patients and type VI or 41-C3 in 3 patients, respectively. The joint alignement was satisfactory and manteined within a range of 2 mm, with an average of 1.18 mm. The mean Rasmussen knee function score was 26.5, with 14 patients having an excellent result and the remaining 10 with a good result. Conclusion: It can be concluded that radiological and clinical outcome was satisfactory and obtained in all cases without complications. This injectable novel biphasic hydroxyapatite and calcium sulfate ceramic material is a valuable armamentarium in the treatment of trauma where bone graft is required.

J	Tomic, S; Baljozovic, A				Tomic, Slavko; Baljozovic, Andreja			Distal humerus nonunions after failed internal fixation - treatment with the Ilizarov external fixator	SRPSKI ARHIV ZA CELOKUPNO LEKARSTVO			English	Article						humerus; nonunion; Ilizarov technique	OPEN REDUCTION; ELBOW REPLACEMENT; FOLLOW-UP; FRACTURES; FAILURE; PART	Introduction/Objective Non unions of the distal humerus after unsuccessful surgical treatment represents a challenging surgical problem. The complexity of this condition is increased by bone atrophy, scar tissue, poorly vascularized bone fragment, limited elbow mobility, osteomyelitis, and local neurological damage. The advantages of using the Ilizarov external fixation method are stable fixation, adequate fracture reduction, and fragment compression accompanied by minimal soft tissue trauma, with the possibility of early elbow mobilization. This aim of this paper is to present the treatment results of 19 patients with nonunion of distal humerus after internal osteosynthesis managed by the llizarov external fixation method. Methods Nineteen consecutive patients were treated with the llizarov external fixator. The study group includes 11 male and eight female patients with an average age of 42 years. Surgical technique consisted of approaching the nonunion, removing loose fixation material, making resection and debridement of bone fragments, after which the Ilizarov fixator was placed. Rehabilitation of the elbow started in the early postoperative period. The functional status of the arm was evaluated using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score. Results All the patients achieved solid bony union after an average of seven months from the application of the external fixator. In 17 patients radiographic analysis indicated the preservation of joint space, while two showed degenerative changes. All the patients showed improvement in elbow range of motion and significantly better DASH score with postoperative value of 21.

Materials and methods: Between September 2007 to May 2012, 11 consecutive patients (mean age, 54.6 years) with inferior pole fractures of the patella (AO/OTA 34-A1) were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Through longitudinal incision, all patients underwent open reduction and internal fixation by separate vertical wiring combined with Krackow suture. The range of motion, loss of fixation, and Bostman score were primary outcome measures. Results: The union time was 10 weeks after surgery on average (range: 8-12). No patient had nonunion, loss of reduction and wire breakage. There was no case of wound problem and irritation from the implant. At final follow-up, the average range of motion arc was 129.4 degrees (range: 120-140). The mean Bostman score at last follow-up was 29.6 points (range: 28-30) and graded excellent in all cases. Conclusion: Separate vertical wiring combined with Krackow suture for inferior pole fractures of the patella is a useful technique that is easy to perform and can provide stable fixation with excellent results in knee function.

Outcome of 20 patients	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						fracture healing; fracture fixation; internal; bone plates; postoperative complications; surgical approach	INTERNAL-FIXATION; CLOSED REDUCTION; SHAFT FRACTURES; PLATE; MANAGEMENT; DCP	Introduction The treatment of fractures of the distal third of the tibia remains still controversial. It is often difficult to get and retain good reduction by non-operative or nailing methods. Open reduction and plate fixation offers good reduction and retention of the achieved position. However, increased soft tissue damage and high complication rate has led to search less invasive surgical methods such as minimal invasive plating technique. Material and methods Lateral approach for the distal tibia allows to reduce and to plate both the fibula and the tibia using only one skin incision. We have used lateral approach for 20 consecutive tibia fracture patients and report clinical and radiological results after an average follow-up of 31 months. Results All fractures united, but two malunions were developed after good primary reduction. Seventeen patients achieved excellent or good subjective result while one had moderate and two poor results. Four superficial wound infections were noticed and they were treated conservatively. Conclusion We conclude that lateral approach for the distal tibia is a demanding, but useful surgical method for treatment of the distal tibia fractures especially in cases where no medial comminution of the tibia is present and when the fibula has to be fixed, too.

Objective: To compare standard posterior dual rod spinopelvic fixation alone with dual rod fixation supplemented with LSI screw fixation. Summary of Background Data: Primary or metastatic tumors of the sacrum requiring a total sacrectomy can result in spinopelvic instability if inadequate fixation is achieved. Many fixation techniques have been proposed to address this instability. However, to date, an optimal fixation technique has not been established. Materials and Methods: Ten fresh-frozen cadaveric spinopelvic specimens were randomized according to bone mineral density (BMD) to either posterior rod fixation (control group) or posterior rod fixation with supplemental LSI screws (LSI group). After fixation, a total sacrectomy of each specimen was performed. Specimens where then potted and axially loaded in a caudal direction. Stiffness, yield load, energy absorbed at yield load, ultimate load, and energy absorbed at ultimate load were computed. A Student t test was used for statistical analysis with significance set at P < 0.05. Results: The average age and BMD were not significantly different between the control and LSI groups (age: P=0.255; BMD: P=0.810). After normalizing for BMD, there were no significant differences detected for any of the biomechanical parameters measured between the 2 fixation techniques: stiffness (P=0.857), yield load (P=0.219), energy at yield load (P=0.293), ultimate load (P=0.407), and energy at ultimate load (P=0.773). However, both fixation techniques were able to withstand physiological loads. Conclusions: Our study did not demonstrate any biomechanical advantage for supplemental LSI screw fixation in our axial loading model. However, given the theoretical advantage of this percutaneous technique, further studies are warranted that take into account forward bending and sagittal stability.

J	Favreau, H; Ehlinger, M; Adam, P; Bonnomet, F				Favreau, Henri; Ehlinger, Matthieu; Adam, Philippe; Bonnomet, Francois			Total hip arthroplasty with exclusive use of dual-mobility cup after failure of internal fixation in trochanteric fracture	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Failure; Internal fixation; Extracapsular; Total hip arthroplasty; Dual mobility; Complications	CORTICAL THICKNESS INDEX; PROXIMAL FEMUR; DISLOCATION	Introduction: Failure of internal fixation in trochanteric fracture (or extracapsular proximal femoral fracture: PFF) is a serious complication often requiring total hip arthroplasty (THA). THA after PPF incurs a higher risk of complications than in intracapsular fracture due to frequent impact on local anatomy, notably with risk of implant dislocation. Recent studies demonstrated a protective effect of dual-mobility (DM) cups against instability in these cases but in a population mixing failure of internal fixation in intra and extracapsular fractures. We therefore conducted a retrospective study focusing on fixation failure in PFF: 1) to assess surgical complications and notably dislocation rate using DM cups, and 2) to analyse the characteristics of the initial fixation and assess conformity with established standards. Hypothesis: DM cups exert a protective effect in PFF fixation failure at high risk of instability. Materials and methods: A single-centre retrospective study included 40 cases over a 10-year period: 30 women, 10 men; mean age, 77 years [range, 31-91 years]. All THAs used DM cups. Approaches were transgluteal in 24 cases, posterior in 15 and anterolateral in one. Clinical assessment comprised of: pain on visual analog scale (VAS), Harris Hip Score (HSS), and Postel Merle-d'Aubigne score (PMA). The rate of surgical complications (periprosthetic fracture, infection, non-union, dislocation) was assessed and the primary fixation quality was analysed for fracture complexity and conformity to standards. Results: At a mean 54 months' follow-up [range, 24-122 months], the post-THA complications rate was 22% (9/40), although with no cases of implant dislocation. Pre- to postoperative comparison found significant improvements on VAS (7.9 +/- 1.6 versus 1.35 +/- 1.5, respectively), HHS (20 +/- 11.8 versus 78 +/- 12.3) and PMA (4.7 +/- 2.9 versus 14.6 +/- 2.1) (p < 0.0001), but non-significant change in Parker-Palmer score (5.5 +/- 2 and 4.8 +/- 1.9) (p = 0.4). Fracture instability rate was 77% and 85% (31 and 34/40) on the AO and Evans-Jensen classifications respectively. Analysis of primary fixation found non-conformity with reduction standards in 68% of cases (27/40): most frequently, cervical screw centering defect (58%, 23/40) and reduction defect (28%, 11/40). The non-conformity rate was 44% (4/9) in AO stable fracture and 74% (23/31) in unstable fracture. Conclusion: The study hypothesis was confirmed, with no dislocations in this high-risk population. This can be attributed to exclusive use of DM cups, which should be systematic in high-risk contexts. The study confirmed the importance of primary fixation quality, although a risk of failure remains, even in stable fractures. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Some studies recommend surgical excision of the fragment, but the results are controversial. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcome of open reduction and internal fixation of a medial epicondyle non-union fragment. Materials and methods: A retrospective study was conducted in all the patients, who were operated in our hospital between the year 2010 and 2015 for symptomatic medial humeral epicondyle non-union. Inclusion criteria were open reduction and internal fixation of symptomatic medial epicondyle non-union and minimum one year of follow-up from time of surgery. Exclusion criteria included other associated musculoskeletal disorders of the affected limb. Open reduction and internal fixation of the fragment was done in all patients and the ulnar nerve was decompressed and anteriorly transposed in cases where symptomatology was present. Outcome was assessed with radiograph, range/arc of motion, Visual analogue pain scoring and two functional outcome tools. Results: Study sample consisted of 14 patients, with mean age at presentation of 14.9 years (range 6 to 50 years) with mean time since injury of 7.7 months (range 3 to 24 months). Patients presented with medial elbow pain and prominence, limited range of motion, valgus instability, and ulnar nerve compression. After open reduction and internal fixation, at a mean of three years after surgery (range 1.5 to 5 years), patients reported an improvement in visual analogue pain score from a mean of 7.29 +/- 1.3 to 0.21 +/- 0.4, and the difference was statistically significant (p=0.001). Mean postoperative Quick DASH (Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand) score was 5.21 +/- 7.2. Mean Mayo Elbow Performance Score was 96.7 +/- 6.1. Improvement in arc of motion was statistically significant (p=0.001). Radiographic union was achieved in all patients except one who had fibrous union. Functional elbow range of motion was achieved in 13 out of 14 cases (92.8%) and ulnar nerve recovered in five patients and one patient required tendon transfer. Conclusion: Open reduction and internal fixation of symptomatic medial humeral epicondyle non-union gives excellent clinical and functional outcome in the majority of cases. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little data is available on delayed skin graft or flap reconstructions of Gustilo grade III injury, especially using new technologies of wound coverage, such as vacuum sealing drainage (VSD) combined with limited internal and/or external fixation. Material/Methods: Between June 2008 and May 2013, we performed the VSD technique combined with limited internal and/or external fixation on 38 patients (22 males and 16 females, with a mean age of 36.5 years) with Gustilo and Anderson grade III injury. VSD was regularly changed and delayed skin grafts or flaps were used to cover the defect. Two patients were lost to follow-up, and the remaining 36 were available for evaluation. The complications, wound healing, infections, and bony union were assessed for a mean duration of 2.5 years (range, 1-4 years). Results: Complications were seen in 5 of the 36 cases: 2 cases had infection alone, 1 case had delayed union or nonunion, 1 case had infection and delayed union, and 1 case had wound necrosis, infection, and nonunion. VSD was regularly changed 2-6 times. Morphological appearance and functional recovery were satisfactory in all cases. Conclusions: Using VSD before skin grafts or flaps coverage, combined with limited internal and/or external fixation, is a suitable option for Gustilo and Anderson grade III injury.

Retrospective case series study of surgical outcome for 21 atlantoaxial subluxation patients treated with a new technique, called cable-dragged reduction/cantilever beam internal fixation. Surgery was performed by a single surgeon. Objective. To describe and evaluate the cable-dragged reduction/cantilever beam internal fixation technique for the treatment for old atlantoaxial subluxation irreducible by traction. Summary of Background Data. Management of old atlantoaxial subluxation has always been a difficult task. A more effective way to achieve surgical reduction is needed. Materials and Methods. Twenty one patients, aged 31.6 +/- 13.3 years (range, 11-67 years), 17 men and four women, with atlantoaxial subluxation that failed to be reduced after 10 to 111 days in traction, underwent posterior cable-dragged reduction/cantilever beam internal fixation surgery. Frankel classification of neural function before surgery was the following: Frankel B, four patients; Frankel C, five patients; Frankel D, four patients; and Frankel E, eight patients. Plain radiographs, computed tomographic three-dimensional reconstructive images and magnetic resonance images of the cervical spine were obtained at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery, and each year thereafter. No patient was lost to follow-up, and the follow-up time ranged from 6 months to 4 years. Rate of reduction and C-1 similar to 3 fusion, as well as improvement of neural function, were recorded and analyzed. Results. The average follow-up period was 13.2 months. Radiographic evaluation of the group at follow-up showed 16 complete and five partial reductions, and satisfactory decompression and C-1 similar to 3 fusion in all cases. Neural function at the end of the follow-up was Frankel B still in one patient, Frankel C in seven patients, and Frankel E in 13 patients. Conclusion. Cable-dragged reduction/cantilever beam internal fixation is almost as effective for reduction as anterior release but is less invasive and risky. It has similar operative time and blood loss to occipitocervical fusion but avoids arthrodesis of occipitoatlantal joint. It is also suitable for patients with severe myelopathy before surgery. Its major disadvantage is that C3, which is left free in the traditional atlantoaxial fusion surgery, has to be involved in fusion. And it is suitable only for patients with intact posterior arches in C1.

Three finite element models including the anterior tension band wiring (ATBW) model, separate vertical wiring (SVW) model and SVW-BSAG model, were built to evaluate the fixation strength of different fixation methods. A total of 41 consecutive patients with IPFP injury were enrolled in this retrospective study, including 23 patients in the ATBW group and 18 patients in the SVW-BSAG group. The operation time, radiation exposure, full weight-bearing time, Bostman score, extension lag versus contralateral healthy leg, Insall-Salvati ratio, and radiograph outcomes were employed to assess and compare the ATBW group and SVW-BSAG group.ResultsThe finite element analysis confirmed that the SVW-BSAG fixation method was as reliable as the ATBW fixation method in terms of fixed strength. Through retrospective analysis, we found that there was no significant difference between the SVW-BSAG and ATBW groups in age, sex, BMI, fracture side, fracture type, or follow-up time. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the Insall-Salvati ratio, 6-month Bostman score, and fixation failure. Compared with the ATBW group, the SVW-BSAG group showed advantages in intraoperative radiation exposure, full weight-bearing time, and extension lag versus the contralateral healthy leg.ConclusionThe finite element analysis and clinical results showed that SVW-BSAG fixation methods are a reliable and valuable for IPFP treatment.

Therapeutic Effects of Small Incision Open Reduction and Internal Fixation and Arthroscopic High Strength Non-Absorbable Suture on Tibial Insertion Avulsion Fracture of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament	ACTA CHIRURGIAE ORTHOPAEDICAE ET TRAUMATOLOGIAE CECHOSLOVACA			English	Article						small incision open reduction and internal fixation; arthroscopic high strength non-absorbable suture; tibial insertion avulsion fracture; anterior cruciate ligament; random walk model	BRIDGE FIXATION	PURPOSE OF THE STUDY To evaluate the therapeutic effects of small incision open reduction and internal fixation and arthroscopic high strength non-absorbable suture on tibial insertion avulsion fracture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). MATERIAL AND METHODS In this prospectively study, 72 patients with ACL tibial insertion avulsion fracture treated from December 2017 to June 2020 were enrolled and divided into group A (treated with small incision open reduction and cannulated screw internal fixation) and group B (treated with arthroscopic high strength non-absorbable suture) using a random number table (n=36). Their general data, surgical indices and incidence of postoperative adverse reactions were compared. Knee function indices were compared before and after treatment, and evaluated by random walk model. RESULTS No significant differences were found in the general data, intraoperative blood loss, preoperative Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Tegner score, knee range of motion and difference of bilateral tibial forward displacement distance, and total incidence rate of postoperative adverse reactions between the two groups (P>0.05). Group B had significantly longer operation time, and significantly shorter hospital stay, time of first ambulation after operation and bone healing time than group A (P<0.05). Both groups had improved Lysholm score, IKDC score, Tegner score and knee range of motion after treatment, especially in group B (P<0.05). The difference of bilateral tibial forward displacement distance significantly reduced in both groups after treatment, particularly in group B (P<0.05). The random walk model revealed that group B had better improvement of knee function than group A. CONCLUSIONS Arthroscopic high strength non-absorbable suture in the treatment of ACL tibial insertion avulsion fracture can dramatically improve the knee function indices of patients, with rapid recovery and high safety, so it has a broad prospect of clinical application.

Materials and Methods: Rigid internal fixation techniques included a 4-hole plate and 4 monocortical screws (miniplate group), a 4-hole plate and 4 monocortical screws with I additional bicortical positional screw (hybrid group), and 3 bicortical positional screws in a traditional inverted-L pattern (inverted-L group). Screws and miniplates were made of titanium and from a 2.0-mm System (MDT, Rio Claro, SP, Brazil). Sixty poly-urethane replicas of human hemimandibles (Nacional, Jau, SP, Brazil) were used as substrates, Simulating a 5-mm advancement surgery by a sagittal split ramus osteotomy. They were adapted to a test support, and were Submitted to lateral torsional forces on the buccal molar Surface and vertical cantilever loading on the incisal edge by an Instron 4411 mechanical testing unit (Instron, Norwood, MA) for recording peak loading at 1 mm, 3 nun, 5 mm, and 10 mm of displacement. Each group was formed by 10 replicas, subjected to a linear noncyclical testing only once. Means and standard deviation were analyzed using analysis of variance and Tukey tests, with a 5% level of significance. Testing failures were also recorded. Results: The miniplate group showed lowest load peak scores (P < .01) when compared with the other fixation techniques, irrespective of the direction of force. The inverted-L group showed higher resistance (P < .01) than the hybrid group when vertical forces were applied. For molar load, the hybrid and inverted-L groups showed no significant difference. Conclusions: For mandibular advancement surgery of 5 mm, it was concluded that the rigid internal fixation technique for sagittal split ramus osteotomies based on 3 bicortical screws in the inverted-L pattern was the most stable in a laboratory environment. Furthermore, the results suggested that installation of a bicortical positional screw in the retromolar region may significantly optimize the resistance of the miniplate and monocortical screw fixation.

Materials and methods: A total of 35 New Zealand White rabbits were used in a bilateral femoral intercondylar fracture model and randomly divided into two groups. n-CDHA/PAA screws were used in the experimental group, and medical metal screws were used in the control group. The fracture condition, range of motion, and the screw push-out strength were assessed, and an arthroscopic examination of knee joint was performed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery. The biodegradation of the n-CDHA/PAA screws in vivo was tested through weighing, and changes in screw structure were assessed by X-ray diffraction at 12 weeks after surgery. Results: The general situation of all animals was good and showed no incision infection and dehiscence after surgery. X-ray scanning showed that significant callus growth was present in both groups at 4 weeks after surgery, and there was no significant difference (P>0.05) in the Lane-Sandhu score between the experimental and control groups at all time points after surgery. There were no statistically significant differences (P>0.05) in the range of motion and Oswestry Arthroscopy Score of arthroscopic examination of the knee joints between the two groups. The screw push-out strength of the control group was stronger than that of the experimental group at 4 weeks after surgery (P<0.05), but after that, there was no significant difference between the groups (P>0.05). The degradation tests showed that the n-CDHA/PAA screws degraded gradually after implantation, and the weight loss rate was approximately 16% at 12 weeks after surgery. The X-ray diffraction results showed that the crystal structure of the outer surface of the n-CDHA/PAA screw has changed at 12 weeks after surgery. Conclusion: The n-CDHA/PAA screw is an effective and safe implant as a potential internal fixation device for an intercondylar fracture of the femur, and its internal fixation effect was similar to that of medical metal screw.

Percutaneous Kirschner-wire (K-wire) pinning has been shown to produce favorable clinical results. However, the fixation power of K-wires is a major concern. Plate fixation is also a surgical option, but it has the disadvantages of tendon adhesion, requirement of secondary surgery for removal of the implant, and postoperative joint stiffness. A fixation method that causes little soft tissue damage and provides high biomechanical stability is required for patients with fifth metacarpal neck fracture for whom surgical intervention is indicated. The present study proposed fixation using K-wires and a cerclage wire to treat fifth metacarpal neck fracture. The fixation power of this new method was compared with that of K-wires alone and plates. Methods: We used a saw blade to create transverse metacarpal neck fractures in 16 artificial metacarpal bone specimens, which were then treated with four types of fixation as follows: (1) locking plate with five locking bicortical screws (LP group), (2) regular plate with five bicortical screws (RP group), (3) two K-wires (K group), and (4) two K-wires and a figure-of-eight cerclage wire (KW group). The specimens were tested by using cantilever bending testing on a material testing system. The stiffness of the four fixation types was determined by observing force-displacement curves. Finally, the Kruskal-Wallis test was adopted to process the data, and the Mann-Whitney exact test was performed to conduct paired comparison between the fixation types. Results: The fixation strength levels of the four fixation approaches for treating fifth metacarpal neck fracture were ranked in a descending order of LP group (24.6 +/- 5.1 N/mm, median +/- interquartile range) > RP group (22.2 +/- 5. 8 N/mm) congruent to KW group (20.1 +/- 3.2 N/mm) > K group (16.9 +/- 3.0 N/mm). Conclusion: The fixation strength of two K-wires was significantly higher when reinforcement was provided using a figure-of-eight cerclage wire. The strength of the proposed approach is similar to that of a regular plate with five bicortical screws but weaker than that of a locking plate with the same amount of bicortical screws. Cerclage wireintegrated K-wires can be an alternative method that avoids the excessive soft tissue dissection required for plating in open reduction internal fixation for fifth metacarpal neck fracture.

Drill-related root injury caused by intraoperative intermaxillary fixation: an analysis of 1067 screw applications	DENTAL TRAUMATOLOGY			English	Article						tooth injury; root trauma; intermaxillary fixation; IMFS; predrilled screws; transgingival fixation	MANDIBULAR FRACTURES; MAXILLOMANDIBULAR FIXATION; MAXILLOFACIAL TRAUMA; BONE SCREWS; ARCH BARS; DAMAGE; MANAGEMENT	Background/AimsIntermaxillary fixation is a standard procedure for the treatment of mandibular fractures or in orthognathic surgery. Predrilling for screws poses the risk of accidental tooth root injury, potentially leading to further pathological processes. Limited evidence about accidental tooth injury during intermaxillary fixation is available due to heterogenous study designs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of root trauma using predrilled transgingival fixation screws and the clinical consequences for the affected teeth. Materials and MethodsIn this retrospective study, the data of open reduction and internal fixation surgery files with intraoperative application of predrilled intermaxillary fixation screws were analysed. The postoperative radiographic images were evaluated for the occurrence of tooth root injury. Patients diagnosed with root injury were clinically followed up with respect to the dental health for the affected teeth. ResultsA total of 133 radiologically diagnosed tooth root injuries were recorded (12.5% of screws). The median follow-up interval was 16 months (range: 3-77 months). The return rate was 49.5% for all patients. Of these, four of the injured teeth (3%) needed endodontic treatment. No toothache was reported, no tooth was lost, and no negative impact on periodontal health was clinically evident. ConclusionIntermaxillary fixation with predrilled transgingival screws is a safe way to manage mandibular fractures. The incidence of tooth root injury is not uncommon, but the adverse side effects are rare and the health of the affected teeth is mostly not compromised.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the significance of unrepaired annular ligament during fixation of isolated radial head fractures. Materials and methods: Retrospectively we reviewed the twenty-five patients who underwent surgical fixation with a plate for Mason type 2, 3 isolated radial head fracture without annular ligament repair. All the radial head fracture did not have the associated injuries which could cause the elbow instabilities. The average length of follow-up was 6.9 years. The outcomes were evaluated clinically (range of motions, instabilities, pain VAS, Broberg & Murrey functional rating score, DASH score) and radiographically (bony union, arthritic change, lateral translation of the radial head, humero-ulnar angle with maximum varus stress of elbow, ulnar variance). Results: The range of motions between affected and contralateral side were not significantly different at last follow-up. No one showed the instabilities of elbow. The mean pain VAS, Broberg & Murrey functional rating score, and DASH score were 2.7 +/- 0.5, 95.3 +/- 2.5, and 14.8 +/- 5.3 points respectively. Bony union was observed for all cases. There was no significant difference in the lateral translation of the radial head, humero-ulnar angle with maximum varus stress of elbow, and ulnar variance between the affected and the contralateral arm. Conclusion: The isolated role of the annular ligament seems overestimated. We scrutinize that the annular ligament repair is not essential in the operative treatment of isolated radial head fractures if the lateral collateral ligament is intact. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Dhillon, MS; Prabhakar, S; Prasanna, C				Dhillon, Mandeep S.; Prabhakar, Sharad; Prasanna, Chandiralingam			Preliminary experience with biodegradable implants for fracture fixation	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Biodegradable implants; fractures; surgeon confidence	TITANIUM; PLATES	Background: Biodegradable implants were designed to overcome the disadvantages of metal-based internal fixation devices. Although they have been in use for four decades internationally, many surgeons in India continue to be skeptical about the mechanical strength of biodegradable implants, hence this study. Materials and Methods: A prospective study was done to assess the feasibility and surgeon confidence level with biodegradable implants over a 12-month period in an Indian hospital. Fifteen fractures (intra-articular, metaphyseal or small bone fractures) were fixed with biodegradable implants. The surgeries were randomly scheduled so that different surgeons with different levels of experience could use the implants for fixation. Results: Three fractures (one humeral condyle, two capitulum), were supplemented by additional K-wires fixation. Trans-articular fixator was applied in two distal radius and two pilon fractures where bio-pins alone were used. All fractures united, but in two cases the fracture displaced partially during the healing phase; one fibula due to early walking, and one radius was deemed unstable even after bio-pin and external fixator. Conclusions: Biodegradable -implants are excellent for carefully selected cases of intra-articular fractures and some small bone fractures. However, limitations for use in long bone fractures persist and no great advantage is gained if a "hybrid" composite is employed. The mechanical properties of biopins and screws in isolation are perceived to be inferior to those of conventional metal implants, leading to low confidence levels regarding the stability of reduced fractures; these implants should be used predominantly in fracture patterns in which internal fixation is subjected to minimal stress.

Materials and methods: We attempted to use the arthroscopic percutaneous inverted mattress suture fixation technique in 17 consecutive cases with isolated displaced GT fractures. Fourteen patients were successfully treated without switching to other methods and were available for follow-up at a mean of 22 months (range: 17-38 months) after surgery. For assessment of clinical outcomes, we evaluated the range of motion and the visual analog scale (VAS) score, the shoulder index of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), and the Korean Shoulder Scale (KSS). Results: At the final follow-up, the VAS improved to 1.0 points (range: 0-3), the mean ASES score improved to 86.9 points (range: 78.3-100) and the KSS improved to 88.6 points (range: 82-100) postoperatively. Mean union time was 10 weeks. Mean forward flexion was 167.8 degrees (range: 140-180 degrees), mean external rotation in neutral position was 36 degrees (range: 20-70 degrees), and mean internal rotation was at the 12th thoracic level (range: T6-L3) at final follow-up. Three cases were switched to open surgery after attempted arthroscopic technique due to large fragment or osteoporosis. Conclusion: In select cases, the arthroscopic percutaneous inverted mattress suture fixation of GT fracture is a simple and reproducible technique with encouraging early results.

Materials and Methods: Eighteen identical synthetic mandibles were used. Left condylar processes were cut to mimic perpendicular subcondylar fracture and right sides were mimicked oblique subcondylar fracture. The fixation systems used included single 4-hole mini adaptation plate, double fixation with the same plates, single 4-hole mini dynamic compression plate (DCP), Eckelt lag screw system, Wurzburg lag screw plate system and double 4-hole biodegradable miniplates made of poly L-lactide (PLLA). In oblique fractures, one of the screws fixing plates was used bicortically through bone fragments. The loading vector simulated physiologic forces to the condyle on biting with servohydraulic testing machine until failure was reached. Load-displacement curve, maximum load for failure, and stiffness were measured. Results: In perpendicular fracture, double adaptation plate showed the highest level of tolerance load followed by Eckelt lag and double PLLA plate. in stiffness, double adaptation plate and Eckelt lag screw showed higher level of stiffness, whereas double PLLA was almost at the same level of single DCP. In oblique fracture, double adaptation plate showed the highest strength. Conclusions: in this laboratory setting, double adaptation plates fixation proved to have superior biomechanical stability in both fracture conditions. Eckelt lag screw showed good stability in the perpendicular fracture, however, it was weak in the oblique fracture. (C) 2006 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

In this paper, a biodegradable composite fixator, composed of poly(epsilon-caprolactone), calcium phosphate ceramic and calcium sulfate (PCL/CPC/CS), is developed. The composition of CS, which has a high dissolution rate, was expected to create a porous structure to improve osteofixation to the composite fixator. PCL, PCL/CPC, and PCL/CPC/CS samples were prepared and their physical properties were characterized in vitro. In vivo performance of the composite screws was verified in the distal femurs of rabbits. Results showed that the PCL/CPC/CS composite had a higher compressive strength (28.55 +/- 3.32 MPa) in comparison with that of PCL (20.64 +/- 1.81 MPa) (p < 0.05). A larger amount of apatite was formed on PCL/CPC/CS than on PCL/CPC, while no apatite was found on PCL after simulated body fluid immersion. In addition, PCL/CPC/CS composites also had a faster in vitro degradation rate (13.05 +/- 3.42% in weight loss) relative to PCL (1.79 +/- 0.23%) and PCL/CPC (4.32 +/- 2.18%) (p < 0.001). In animal studies, PCL/CPC/CS screws showed a greater volume loss than that of PCL or PCL/CPC at 24 weeks post-implantation. Under micro-computerized tomography observation, animals with PCL/CPC/CS implants had better osseointegration in terms of the structural parameters of the distal metaphysis, including trabecular number, trabecular spacing, and connectivity density, than the PCL screw. This study reveals that the addition of CS accelerates the biodegradation and enhanced apatite formation of the PCL/CPC composite screw. This osteoconductive PCL/CPC/CS is a good candidate material for internal fixation devices.

Finite Element-Derived Surrogate Models of Locked Plate Fracture Fixation Biomechanics	ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Finite element; Fracture fixation; Locking plate and screw; Response surface	LOCKING PLATES; MECHANICAL CONDITIONS; STABILITY; PRINCIPLES; STIFFNESS; MOVEMENT; LCP	Internal fixation of bone fractures using plates and screws involves many choices-implant type, material, sizes, and geometric configuration-made by the surgeon. These decisions can be important for providing adequate stability to promote healing and prevent implant mechanical failure. The purpose of this study was to develop mathematical models of the relationships between fracture fixation construct parameters and resulting 3D biomechanics, based on parametric computer simulations. Finite element models of hundreds of different locked plate fixation constructs for midshaft diaphyseal fractures were systematically assembled using custom algorithms, and axial, torsional, and bending loadings were simulated. Multivariate regression was used to fit response surface polynomial equations relating fixation design parameters to outputs including maximum implant stresses, axial and shear strain at the fracture site, and construct stiffness. Surrogate models with as little as three regressors showed good fitting (R (2) = 0.62-0.97). Inner working length was the strongest predictor of maximum plate and screw stresses, and a variety of quadratic and interaction terms influenced resulting biomechanics. The framework presented in this study can be applied to additional types of bone fractures to provide clinicians and implant designers with clinical insight, surgical optimization, and a comprehensive mathematical description of biomechanics.

J	Aspenberg, P				Aspenberg, Per			Alendronate-eluting polyglucose-lignol composite (POGLICO) A new biomaterial for fracture fixating implants	ACTA ORTHOPAEDICA			English	Article							IMPROVES; BONE	Background and purpose - Due to the known drawbacks of metal implants, new biomaterials for internal fracture fixation are attracting increasing interest, among them poly(lactic-coglucolic) acids (PLGAs) and the recently developed silk-tenoin derived materials (STDMs). In accordance with the new philosophy of bio-derived biomaterials (BIODERIBIOs), I describe a novel innovative technology for use in fracture fixation. Patients and methods - Screws (2 mm dia.) were manufactured from cylindrical bars of polyglucose-lignol composite (POGLICO) in the form of birch toothpicks from the hospital canteen, dip-coated with alendronate (1 mg/mL, n = 6) or saline (n = 6), and inserted in the proximal tibias of rats for 4 weeks. Fixation was evaluated by mechanical pullout testing. POGLICO nails were inserted in the contralateral tibia for microCT and histology. Results - All POGLICO implants remained fixed in the bone (p < 0.001) with a mean pullout force of 37 (SD 5.5) N. MicroCT showed that the control nails were surrounded by a thin layer of new bone, while all bisphosphonate-treated implants were surrounded by a thick layer of cancellous bone. Bisphosphonates more than doubled the bone density around the nails (p = 0.004). Interpretation - POGLICO is biocompatible, remains in situ, and appears to provide a higher resistance to pullout forces than bulk silk protein. The material is light, strong, and bio-derived. BIODERIBIO-POGLICO can be sterilized by autoclaving, and has a porous surface that can serve for slow release of drugs applied by simple dip-coating, as demonstrated by the effect of the alendronate treatment. As the raw material for the screws is readily available from the toothpick industry, I believe that the possibilities for commercial development of the material for fracture fixation are promising..

Fatigue-related mechanisms are responsible for most mechanical failures of orthopedic plates. Plate design needs to be optimized for both long fatigue life and bone healing. Only in this way can we reduce the occurrence of internal fixation failure. To address this issue, we aimed to provide a theoretical basis for improving the design of orthopedic plates. Material and Methods: The finite element method was used to conduct a computational investigation. Three groups of plate models were designed with varied working lengths and other elements. By fixing these plates to tibial mid-shaft fracture models, parameters of the mechanical environment around the fracture site were recorded and analyzed. Results: Plate working length, existence of holes within the working length, and plate length are important factors that influence the mechanical environment of the fracture site. The screw-bone interface is the weakest part in internal fixation failure. Fractures fixed by traditional plates that had holes in the working length have larger interfragmentary movement, and these plates have more severe stress concentration than plates without holes in the working length. Conclusions: We presented some suggestions for the plating system. First, partial weight bearing is recommended in the early postoperative period. Second, the working length of the plate does have an optimal range, depending on the fracture types. Finally, the hole within the working length should be removed to avoid stress concentration and facilitate fracture healing. Based on the findings from this study, recommendations can be developed to improve clinical practices and plating system design.

Thus this study's aim was to assess different forms of condylar fixation when combined with symphyseal fracture fixation. Materials and Methods: Using finite element models, we analyzed the stress distribution that occurs when a condylar fracture is fixed with 1 miniplate, 2 miniplates, or a trapezoidal condylar miniplate and when a symphyseal fracture is fixed with 2 parallel plates, 2 perpendicular plates, or 2 lag screws. The null hypothesis was that there would be no differences among the different fixation techniques. Results: The results showed a stress concentration in the anterior region of the condyle, close to the sigmoid notch. Moreover, adequate fixation in the symphysis could result in less tension at the condylar region. Therefore, when the symphysis was fixed with a lag-screw technique, condylar fixation was less required, showing a more adequate stress distribution when the condyle was fixed with 1 or 2 plates. Conversely, when the symphyseal fixation was less effective, by use of perpendicular plates, there was a change in the stress distribution at the condylar region, altering fixation behavior and resulting in more tension and displacement in the condyle, especially when a trapezoidal plate was used. Conclusions: A lag screw and parallel double plates appear to be suitable for symphyseal fixation, whereas 2 straightly positioned plates and a trapezoidal plate are suitable for condylar fixation. However, the combination of perpendicular plates in symphyseal fixation and a trapezoidal plate in condylar fixation showed an altered stress distribution.

Material/Methods: Seventy-one patients were randomly allocated to group A (by PRHCF) and group B (by ORIF). Operative time, visual analogue scale (VAS) score, time from injury to operation, postoperative hospital stay, preoperative and postoperative radiographic measurements, and complications were recorded. Functional outcomes were assessed using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores. Results: Finally, 59 patients were followed up for at least 12 months (range, 12-24 months). Group A showed significantly more advantages than group B in term of operative time, intraoperative blood loss, time to operation, postoperative hospital stay, and postoperative pain relief during the first 3 days (P<0.001). However, more intraoperative fluoroscopy was required in group A than in group B (P<0.001). The calcaneal width, height, length, Bohler angle, and Gissane angle in each group were significantly improved postoperatively (all P<0.001), although not significantly different in the postoperative comparisons between both groups. The AOFAS scores were slightly superior in group A than in group B (88.3 vs. 86.4, P=0.08). The rate of incidence of postoperative complications was lower in group A than in group B (3.2% vs. 10.8%, respectively; OR, 0.28, 95% CI, 0.03 to 2.84), although there was no significant difference (P=0.337). Conclusions: PRHCF showed comparable clinical and radiological outcomes as ORIF, demonstrating it is a safe and effective alternative in treating DIACFs.

Most of these fractures unite well but chances of osteonecrosis are quite high even after early operations and till date there is no well-defined method of prediction and prevention of osteonecrosis. Vascularized bone graft may prevent the development of osteonecrosis.Materials and Methods This is a retrospective case control study done in an urban Medical College in eastern India and tried to evaluate efficacy of addition of quadratus femoris muscle pedicle bone graft in cases of osteosynthesis comparing the results of cases treated with closed reduction and internal fixation alone for femoral neck fractures We have taken into consideration 45 consecutive cases from each group with identical demographic background and of very similar age pattern of 20 years to 60 years.For further reference, we will describe Group I for closed reduction and CHS/DHS only, and Group II for closed reduction CHS and quadratus femoris muscle pedicle graft.Results Satisfactory bony union occurred in 42 out of 45 follow-up patients in Group 1 (93.3%) and 43 out of 45 patients in Group 2. (95.5%) In 2- to 10-year follow-up period, eight patients (18.6%) developed osteonecrosis in Group I, and in Group 2, in the same period, there were no cases of osteonecrosis.Conclusion Addition of quadratus femoris muscle pedicle bone graft is a very effective procedure for prevention of osteonecrosis when we attempt osteosynthesis by closed reduction and internal fixation for displaced femoral neck fractures.

Advancing age and numerous comorbidities largely account for high mortality rate and require geriatric expertise. Treatment options are total hip arthroplasty (THA), hemiarthroplasty (HA) or osteosynthesis. Literature suggests THA or HA for better outcomes, although no clear guidelines exist. Material and methods A retrospective chart review was performed of 63 patients (80 +/- 11 years; 32 women, 31 men) with Garden one femoral neck fractures treated between June 2018 and June 2020 with either HA or internal fixation with the Femoral Neck System (FNS). Primary outcome measures were surgical and non-surgical complication rates and best achievable mobilization during the hospital stay. Results Thirty four patients were treated with HA, and 29 with the FNS. Mobilization was measured using the Charite Mobility Index (CHARMI). No difference between age, ASA, CCI or preoperative CHARMI was found. The CHARMI was significantly lower in the HA group. No difference in surgical complications was found. The HA cohort showed more non-surgical complications, a longer ICU stay and more blood transfusions. Hospitalization was significant longer in the HA than the FNS cohort (15.1 +/- 5.1 vs 9.8 +/- 3.8 days). Radiographic controls were performed after 6 and 12 weeks. The FNS group showed a mean shortening of 3.3 mm. 4 of 21 patient had shortening >5 mm. 20 of 21 patients showed radiographic signs of bone healing after 3 months. Conclusion Early results with the FNS show faster recovery than patient with hemiarthroplasty. Internal fixation with the FNS may be an option in non-displaced femoral neck fractures. Further studies should be performed to better evaluate the FNS compared to traditional internal fixation methods and arthroplasty.

Methods Forty patients who underwent DECT were evaluated in this retrospective study. Images were reconstructed with M_0.6 and with VMI+ and VMI at 10-keV intervals from 40 keV to 190 keV. Attenuation and noise were measured in the hyperdense artefacts, hypodense artefacts, spinal canal, abdominal aorta (AA), and inferior vena cava (IVC). An artefact index (AI) was calculated. A subjective evaluation of the metal-bone interface, surrounding soft tissue, spinal canal, AA, and IVC was conducted. Results The AI values for the hypodense artefacts, spinal canal, and IVC were lowest in the 130 keV VMI+ series, for the hyperdense artefacts in the 120 keV VMI+ series, and for the AA in the 190 keV VMI+ series. Except for the hypodense artefacts, the AI values were lower compared to the M_0.6 images and all the VMI series (all p < 0.05). The subjective image quality was highest at 130 keV VMI+ for the metal-bone interface, surrounding soft tissue, AA, and IVC, and at 120 keV VMI+ for the spinal canal. Except for the AA, these rating scores were higher compared to the M_0.6 images and the entire VMI series (all p < 0.05). Conclusions DECT with high-keV VMI+ efficiently reduces metal artefacts and shows superior image quality in patients with lumbar internal fixation.

Comparison of biomechanical behaviour of maxilla following Le Fort I osteotomy with 2-versus 4-plate fixation using 3D-FEA Part 3: Inferior and anterior repositioning surgery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article						3D finite element analysis; Le Fort I osteotomy; inferior repositioning surgery; internal fixation	FINITE-ELEMENT-ANALYSIS; PIECE LE-FORT-1 OSTEOTOMY; ENDOSSEOUS IMPLANTS; SKELETAL STABILITY; ADVANCEMENT; STRESSES; SCREW	Having studied the effect of maxillary advancement and maxillary impaction in parts 1 and 2 of this research, the purpose of this study was to investigate the biomechanical behavior of different fixation models in inferiorly and anteriorly repositioned maxilla following Le Fort I osteotomy. Two separate three-dimensional finite element models, simulating the inferiorly advanced maxilla at Le Fort 1 level, were used to compare 2- and 4-plate fixation. Model INF-2 resulted in 247 897 elements and 53 247 nodes and INF-4 consisted of 273 130 elements and 59 917 nodes. The stresses occurring in and around the bone and plate-screw complex were computed. The highest Von Mises stresses on the plates and maximum principal stresses on the bones were found in INF-2, especially under horizontal and oblique loads, when compared with INF-4. The present biomechanical study shows that the traditionally used 4-plate fixation technique, following Le Fort I inferior and anterior repositioning surgery, Without bone grafting, provides fewer stress fields on the maxillary bones and fixation materials.

Minimally invasive fixation of type B and C interprosthetic femoral fractures	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Femoral fracture; Interprosthetic fracture; Periprosthetic fracture; Internal fixation; Locked-plate; Minimally invasive	FEMUR FRACTURES; STABILIZATION SYSTEM; PLATE	Introduction: Interprosthetic femoral fractures are rare and raise unresolved treatment issues such as the length of the fixation material that best prevents secondary fractures. Awareness of the advantages of locked-plate fixation via a minimally invasive approach remains limited, despite the potential of this method for improving success rates. Hypothesis: Femur-spanning (from the trochanters to the condyles) locked-plate fixation via a minimally invasive approach provides high healing rates with no secondary fractures. Materials and methods: From January 2004 to May 2011, all eight patients seen for interprosthetic fractures were treated with minimally invasive locked-plate fixation. Mean time since hip arthroplasty was 47.5 months and mean time since knee arthroplasty was 72.6 months. There were 12 standard primary prostheses and four revision prostheses; 11 prostheses were cemented and a single prosthesis showed femoral loosening. Classification about the hip prostheses was Vancouver B in one patient and Vancouver C in seven patients; about the knee prosthesis, the fracture was SoFCOT B in three patients and SOFCOT C in five patients, and a single fracture was SoFCOT D. Minimally invasive locking-plate fixation was performed in all eight patients, with installation on a traction table in seven patients. Results: Healing was obtained in all eight patients, after a mean of 14 weeks (range, 12-16 weeks). One patient had malalignment with more than 5 of varus. There were no general or infectious complications. One patient died, 32 months after surgery. The mean Parker-Palmer mobility score decreased from 6.2 pre-operatively to 2.5 at last follow-up. Early construct failure after 3 weeks in one patient required surgical revision. There was no change in implant fixation at last follow-up. No secondary fractures were recorded. Discussion: In patients with type B or C interprosthetic fractures, femur-spanning fixation not only avoids complications related to altered bone stock and presence of prosthetic material, but also decreases the risk of secondary fractures by eliminating stress riser zones. The minimally invasive option enhances heating by preserving the fracture haematoma. Thus, healing was obtained consistently in our patients, with no secondary fractures, although the construct failed in one patient. Level of evidence: Level IV. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Study DesignCase series. Materials and MethodsMedical records (October 1988 to August 2007) of horses that had internal fixation of the distal aspect of the tarsus were reviewed. Horses that had a broad dynamic compression plate (DCP) or broad locking compression plate (LCP) applied on the plantar-lateral aspect of the tarsus extending from the proximal calcaneus to the proximal one third of the metatarsus were included. Signalment, clinical signs, radiographic findings, time to surgery, implant type, postoperative management and complications were recorded. Long-term (>1 year) outcome was obtained for 4 horses. ResultsFive horses were treated, 4 had DCP fixation and 1 had LCP fixation. Subluxation of the proximal intertarsal joint was treated in 3 horses and 2 horses had fractures of the distal tarsal bones or proximal aspect of the metatarsus. Perioperative complications included peroneus tertius rupture (2 horses) and postoperative infection.(1) Four horses were discharged and 1 year after surgery were considered sound at pasture; 3 horses were sound enough for limited riding. ConclusionsPlate fixation provides adequate strength and stability for successful management of injuries that result in plantar instability of the tarsus and proximal metatarsus.

When these occur, they may severely limit temporomandibular joint (TMJ) function. In such cases, a reconstruction of the joint is indicated, which can be achieved by means of an alloplastic prosthesis. This article reports a rare case of impaction of osteosynthesis material in the region of the base of the skull associated with a mandibular condyle fracture treated with rigid internal fixation, which resulted in complications. There was progression to condylar resorption, requiring an alloplastic TMJ reconstruction, which was performed in a single surgical session.	[Dantas, J. F. C.; Sarmento, V.

Materials and Methods: This single-center study involved retrospective analysis of 100 consecutive patients with cancer with pathologic pelvic fractures managed with percutaneous FICS. Image guidance was performed with fluoroscopy and cone-beam CT needle guidance software. Pain palliative outcomes and opioid use after FICS were compared by means of paired-sample t test. Results: A total of 107 percutaneous FICS procedures were performed from 2010 to 2017 to palliate 141 pathologic fractures in 100 patients (mean age, 65.0 years +/- 17.6 [standard deviation; female age, 66.3 years +/- 18.0; mean, 63.7 years +/- 17.2]). Of 107 procedures, 104 (97.2%) were technically successful, with mean postprocedure hospitalization of 2 days +/- 3. Complications occurred in 14 patients: focal pain at procedure site for longer than 48 hours (n = 5), hematoma (n = 3), progressive fracture despite fixation (n = 2), infection (n = 1), tumor track seeding (n = 1), and screw displacement (n = 2). In the 88 patients who completed early follow-up, mean numeric rating scale pain score was significantly improved at 6 weeks from 6.1 +/- 2.5 to 2.1 +/- 3.0 (P<.001). Opioid use was reduced at 6 weeks (preprocedure vs postprocedure, 91.3 g +/- 121 vs 64.6 +/- 6 124, respectively; P =.04). Conclusion: Fluoroscopy and cone-beam CT-guided percutaneous fixation of pathologic pelvis fractures by internal cemented screw is a safe and effective approach that can reduce pain and opioid use.

The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the surgical treatment and long-term outcomes of dentate mandibular fractures in children and adolescents. Material and MethodsPatients with mandibular fractures in the dentate area who were surgically treated in the period from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2020, were included. The following data were collected: age, gender, cause and mechanism of injury, fracture site and type, associated maxillofacial fractures, the timing of surgical treatment, Facial Injury Severity Scale (FISS) score, surgical approach, number and thickness of plates, hospitalization stay and outcome. Patients were divided into three groups: deciduous (<= 6 years, group A), mixed (7-12 years, group B), and permanent (13-18 years, group C) dentitions. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software. ResultsDuring the study 91 patients (male: female ratio, 3.8:1), 4 in group A, 12 in group B, and 75 in group C, with 65 single and 52 double fractures were included. An intraoral approach was used in 87% of patients. In group C, 90% of patients were treated with fixation schemes consistent with those suggested in the literature for adults, versus 75% in groups A and B. Median follow-up time was 20 months. No tooth germ injury or facial asymmetry was observed and only six group C patients had post-operative malocclusions. Hardware removal occurred in 22% of the patients. ConclusionsThis 20-year retrospective study shows that open reduction and internal fixation of pediatric dentate mandibular fractures caused no tooth germ damage or disturbances of mandibular growth in any dentition stage. Internal fixation schemes were similar to those used for adults, although it was necessary to adapt hardware size and position according to tooth and patient age.

YONSEI MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Humeral fractures; cerclage; cables; fracture fixation; intramedullary nail	PLATE OSTEOSYNTHESIS; RADIAL NERVE; MANAGEMENT; FIXATION; PALSY	Purpose: To evaluate the time to bone union after open reduction and internal fixation with cerclage cables followed by intramedullary nailing (IMN) for unstable humeral shaft fractures. Materials and Methods: Patients with a humeral shaft fracture treated by IMN were enrolled. One group of patients was treated via open reduction and internal fixation with cables followed by IMN (cable group; n= 32), while the other group was treated with a conventional closed IMN (non-cable group; n= 64). The length of time to bone union and functional scores [Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) scores] were measured for all patients. Results: No significant differences were found in terms of age, gender, injury type, or smoking history between the two groups, except for the type of fracture. The cable group had significantly more complex types of fracture than the non-cable group (p<0.001). The mean time to bone union was 3.9 months in the cable group, while in the non-cable group, it was 4.4 months (p=0.041). The incidence of postoperative complications, such as non-union, delayed union, and radial nerve palsy, was similar between the two groups (p>0.05). No differences were identified in terms of DASH and UCLA scores (28.8 and 32.1 in the cable group and 26.4 and 32.6 in the non-cable group, respectively; p=0.335 and 0.264). Conclusion: In unstable humeral shaft fractures treated by IMN, open reduction and internal fixation with additional cerclage cables do not delay the length of time to bone union or increase the rate of other complications.

The current trend is open reduction and internal fixation with a plate or multiple screws through the sinus tarsi approach. Most postoperative protocols are prolonged non-weight bearing that causes a high socioeconomic burden. This study aims to determine the safety of the early weight-bearing protocol of screws-only fixation in calcaneal fracture.Materials and MethodsEvaluate displaced intraarticular calcaneus fractures treated with screws-only technique via the sinus tarsi approach in our institution. The first group, from July 2017 to December 2018, allowed patients to start partial weight bearing as tolerated at 4 weeks after surgery. The second group prospectively from January 2019 to March 2020, which assign patients to keep non-weight bearing for 8 weeks. The functional outcomes (Thai Foot and ankle ability measure subjective form, FAAM) were measured 6 months after surgery. The radiographic outcome (Bohler's angle and Gissane angle) was measured on the first day postoperative and 6 months follow-up, and the changes in these angles were recorded.ResultsThere were 28 patients in each group. The outcomes were collected and compared by a T-test. In the early weight-bearing group, The FAAM, Bohler's angle loss, and Gissane's angle change were 76.4 +/- 14.8, 2.4 +/- 3.5, and 6.6 +/- 7.8, respectively. In the delayed weight-bearing group, The FAAM, Bohler's angle loss, and Gissane's angle change were 81 +/- 14.8, 2 +/- 1.8 and 2.6 +/- 6.1, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in FAAM score, Bohler's angle loss, and Gissane's angle change between early and delayed weight-bearing groups.ConclusionScrews fixation in calcaneal fracture may be safe to allow early weight-bearing protocol.

Minifragment Plate Fixation of High-Energy Navicular Body Fractures	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Navicular; Avascular Necrosis; Talonavicular Arthritis; Midfoot Injuries; High-Energy	LONG-TERM; DISLOCATION; FOOT; MECHANISM	Background: The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of miniplate fixation in navicular fractures to restore medial column stability, maintain reduction, and determine the impact this approach may have on the development of avascular collapse of the navicular. We hypothesized that comminuted fractures of the navicular can be safely reduced and maintained to union with minifragment plate fixation with a low incidence of avascular collapse. Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on 24 patients with navicular fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation with minifragment plate fixation at a level one trauma center over a period of 6 years. Results: All fractures united. No patient developed a deep infection. There was no loss of reduction. Isolated broken screws were evident in three patients (12.5%), with no plate breakage, and no implant failure by pullout. Four patients (17%) underwent plate removal for painful prominent hardware following fracture healing. Four patients (17%) developed radiographic arthrosis of the talonavicular joint. One patient (4%) had radiographic avascular collapse evident at 6 months and was treated with plate removal and an orthotic device. Conclusion: Minifragment fixation was a good alternative to independent lag screws for rigid stabilization of navicular body fractures	[Agel, Julie] Univ Washington, Harborview Med Ctr, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Seattle, WA 98104 USA	Harborview Medical Center; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle	Agel, J (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Harborview Med Ctr, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Box 359798,325 9th Ave, Seattle, WA 98104 USA.	bagel@u.washington.edu							15	14	14	0	1	AMER ORTHOPAEDIC FOOT & ANKLE SOC, INC	SEATTLE	2517 EASTLAKE AVE EAST, STE 200, SEATTLE, WA 98102 USA	1071-1007			FOOT ANKLE INT	Foot Ankle Int.

Complications following open reduction and internal fixation versus external fixation in treating unstable distal radius fractures: Grading the evidence through a meta-analysis	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Distal radius fractures; ORIF; EF; Complications; Meta-analysis	VOLAR LOCKING PLATE; DISPLACED INTRAARTICULAR FRACTURES; PERCUTANEOUS FIXATION; CLOSED REDUCTION; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; PIN FIXATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; OUTCOMES	Background: The common fixation techniques for unstable distal radius fractures include open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with plates and closed reduction and external fixation (EF). There is controversy over the choice of surgical approach in treating unstable distal radius fractures. Hypothesis: This meta-analysis was performed to compare complication rates in patients treated with ORIF or EF for unstable distal radius fractures and to develop GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation)-based recommendations for using the procedures to treat unstable distal radius fractures. Materials and methods: A systematic search of all the studies published was conducted using the Pubmed, ScienceDirect, Embase, BIOSIS, Springer, Cochrane Library databases. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared ORIF with EF in treating adult patients with unstable distal radius fractures and provided data regarding the complication were identified. The demographic characteristics and adverse events were manually extracted from all of the included studies. RevMan 5.1 was used for data analysis. PRISMA guidelines were followed. Results: Sixteen studies that included a total of 1280 patients met the inclusion criteria. Compared with ORIF, EF results in higher incidence of total complications, infection and malunion. The overall GRADE system evidence quality was very low, which reduces our confidence in the recommendations of this system. Discussion: This meta-analysis indicates that ORIF and EF are both effective procedures for treating unstable distal radius fractures. ORIF may be superior to EF in the treatment of unstable distal radius fractures. Because of the low quality evidence currently available, high-quality RCTs are required. Level of evidence: Level II: low-powered prospective randomized trial meta-analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.	[Yuan, Z. Z.; Liu, Q.; Liu, Y.

Materials and methods: Thirty patients underwent short PPSF without fusion. CT-scan was performed in the pre- and post-operative time at four, eight and 12 months. The six zygapophyseal joints adjacent the fracture's level were evaluated. Results: At four months patients showed no differences between pre- and post-operative joint radiographic aspect. At eight and 12 months, CT-scan demonstrated a progressive degeneration only in the middle joints respectively in 21.42% and in 76.92% of the cases. All 10 disrupted facet joints showed progressive degenerative changes at eight and 12 months. Conclusion: Lumbar percutaneous fixation without fusion induces little degenerations essentially collocated in the middle joints close to fracture level at eight and 12 months. In the proximal and distal joints adjacent the screws degenerative changes can be seen only when associated to pedicle-screw encroachment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Material: A retrospective analysis of 126 consecutive patients with 148 operatively treated calcaneal fractures was performed. Only primarily closed fractures were included in the study. Results: Wound healing was problematic in 35 cases (24 per cent). The wound was infected in 23 cases (16 per cent) and a wound edge necrosis was observed in 12 cases (8 per cent). The soft tissue complication needed operative treatment in 20 cases (14 per cent). The complications did not lead to amputations in any case. In the end of the follow up all wounds had healed. Conclusions: The statistical analysis identified a longer delay in surgery and longer operation time to be positive risk factors for wound complications.

Calcium phosphate cement augmentation of cancellous bone screws can compensate for the absence of cortical fixation	JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS			English	Article						Screw fixation; Pullout force; Calcium phosphate cement; Osteoporotic bone	INTERNAL-FIXATION; FRACTURES; METHYLMETHACRYLATE; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; OSTEOPOROSIS; FAILURE	An obvious means to improve the fixation of a cancellous bone screw is to augment the surrounding bone with cement. Previous studies have shown that bone augmentation with Calcium Phosphate (Cap) cement significantly improves screw fixation. Nevertheless, quantitative data about the optimal distribution of CaP cement is not available. The present study aims to show the effect of cement distribution on the screw fixation strength for various cortical thicknesses and to determine the conditions at which cement augmentation can compensate for the absence of cortical fixation in osteoporotic bone. In this study, artificial bone materials were used to mimic osteoporotic cancellous bone and cortical bone of varying thickness. These bone constructs were used to test the fixation strength of cancellous bone screws in different cortical thicknesses and different cement augmentation depths. The cement distribution was measured with microCT. The maximum pullout force was measured experimentally. The microCT analysis revealed a pseudo-conic shape distribution of the cement around the screws. While the maximum pullout strength of the screws in the artificial bone only was 30 +/- 7 N, it could increase up to approximately 1000 N under optimal conditions. Cement augmentation significantly increased pullout force in all cases. The effect of cortical thickness on pullout force was reduced with increased cement augmentation depth. Indeed, cement augmentation without cortical fixation increased pullout forces over that of screws without cement augmentation but with cortical fixation. Since cement augmentation significantly increased pullout force in all cases, we conclude that the loss of cortical fixation can be compensated by cement augmentation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of the results of 116 cases that were performed in Singapore General Hospital and Changi General Hospital over a 2-year period was undertaken. The minimum period of follow-up was 2 years. Results: The median age of the study group was 71 years and approximately two-thirds were females. There were 104 (90%) cases of undisplaced (Garden 1 and 2) fractures and 12 (10%) displaced (Garden 3 and 4) fractures. The specific complication rate was much higher in the displaced group of patients. At 2 years' postoperation, 85% returned to their premorbid level of ambulation and 90% reported good pain relief. The 1-year mortality rate was 7%. Conclusion: Cancellous screw fixation is a relatively safe and useful operation. It achieved our aim of returning most patients to their pre-fracture level of ambulation and providing good pain relief.

Simple blowout fractures, on the other hand, require only manual reduction without fixation. Although several types of blowout fractures do not require total reconstruction, some fixation is usually necessary. Methods: Eighteen cases of blowout fracture were treated with transzygomatic Kirschner wire fixation between 2002 and 2009. This technique was applied to simple fracture cases in which periorbital soft tissue re-herniated through the floor defect into the maxillary sinus after manual reduction, despite improvement of the extra-ocular muscle entrapment. The wire was used to directly support the fracture segment in five cases and used together with a maxillary sinus anterior wall bone graft in 13 cases. Results: Mean follow-up was 12.5 months. Mild diplopia remained as a subjective symptom in one case. None of the cases developed major complications or conspicuous scars on the cheek. Conclusions: Transzygomatic Kirschner wire fixation for blowout fracture has the advantages of precise and rigid fixation of all parts of the inferior floor, minimal morbidity without requiring an orbital approach and long-term safety without artificial remnants. This technique can be applied for the treatment of simple blowout fractures. (C) 2012 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Predictable Healing of Femoral Neck Fractures Treated With Intraoperative Compression and Length-Stable Implants	JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE			English	Article						Femoral neck fractures; Trauma; Length stable fixation; Post operative collapse after operative fixation of femoral neck fractures	INTRACAPSULAR HIP-FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; DISPLACED FRACTURES; COMPONENT OFFSET; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; GARDEN SCREWS; ARTHROPLASTY; METAANALYSIS; IMPINGEMENT; DISCREPANCY	Objectives: A healed, yet shortened, femoral neck has historically been deemed a success in fracture treatment. This, however, comes at the price of diminished physical function and quality of life. We analyzed the outcomes of our treatment algorithm, which attempts to minimize postoperative shortening of femoral neck fractures and determined which preoperative factors were associated with femoral neck shortening and failure of surgical fixation. Level of Evidence: This is level IV retrospective study. Materials: Fifty-four patients underwent open reduction and internal fixation for acute femoral neck fracture with nonsliding constructs. The collapse of the femoral neck in the horizontal (X), vertical (Y), and along the resultant along the (Z) vector (X(->) + Y(->) = Z(->)) was measured on anteroposterior radiographs corrected for leg rotation. The migration of the superior-most screw tip in all axes was measured. Age, gender, Garden grade, and Pauwel's angle were analyzed for their association with shortening or failure of surgical fixation. Results: The average age of the patients was 78.1 years. There were 23 Garden I, 2 Garden II, 14 Garden III, and 15 Garden IV fractures. Fifty-one (94%) healed successfully without complications. The minimum follow-up was 9 months (average, 17.6 months; range, 9-30 months). Surgical fixation failed in two patients, and one patient developed avascular necrosis. The average displacement of the femoral head and the screw tip was 1.23, 0.86, 1.98 mm and 0.7 mm, 0.9 mm, and 1.7 mm in the X, Y, and Z (resultant) vectors, respectively. Discussion: With careful consideration to reduction, we fixed femoral neck fractures with nonsliding constructs, resulting in a high union rate with very minimal shortening of the femoral neck.

Materials and Methods: Synthetic hemi-mandible replicas made in polyurethane were used to evaluate a control, and 3 mandibular condyle plating techniques using 2-mm system plates and screws. The plating techniques were fixation with a 4-hole plate and 4 6-mm screws, fixation with a 4-hole plate and 4 8-mm screws and fixation with 2 4-hole plates with 4 6-mm screws each. Each group was subjected to linear loading in medial to lateral and anterior to posterior directions by an Instron 4411 servohydraulic mechanical testing unit (Instron Corp, Norwood, MA). Load peak value and peak displacement were measured. Means and standard derivations were derived and compared for statistical significance using an analyses variance (P < .05) and compared by Tukey test. Results: Statistically significant differences were noted between fixation groups for the different mechanical measures evaluated under the different directions of linear loading. The 2-platc fixation system presented better behavior, followed by 1 plate with 4 8-mm screws and 1 plate with 4 6-mm screws. The fixation systems used were more resistant to antero-posterior load and the use of 8-mm screws improved the resistance of the fixation when compared with 6-mm screws only in the anteroposterior test. Conclusion: Under the conditions tested the 2-plate fixation system provided the most favorable mechanical behavior. We can suggest that lengthy screws, with bicortical engagement, can increase the stability at fixation of mandibular condylar process fractures.

The purpose of this study was to compare the results of two surgical approaches for cervical OPLL involving multiple levels; anterior direct decompression and fixation, and posterior indirect decompression and fixation. We present a retrospective review of 56 cases followed at a single Institution. Materials and Methods: We compared patients of multiple levels cervical OPLL that were treated at a single institution either with anterior direct decompression and fixation or with posterior indirect decompression and fixation. The clinical records of the patients with a minimum duration of follow-up of 2 years were reviewed. The associated complications were recorded. Results: Fifty-six patients constitute the clinical material. 26 cases were treated by anterior corpectomy and fixation and 30 cases received posterior laminectomy and fixation. The two populations were similar. It was found that both anterior and posterior decompression and fixation can achieve satisfactory outcomes, and posterior surgery was accomplished in a shorter period of time with lesser blood loss. Although patients had comparable preoperative Japanese Orthopaedics Association (JOA) scores, those with a canal occupancy by OPLL more than 50 and managed anteriorly had better outcomes. However, for those with more severe stenosis, anterior approach was more difficult and associated with higher risks and complications. Despite its limitations in patients with high occupancy OPLLs, through the multiple level laminectomy, posterior fixation can achieve effective decompression, maintaining or restoring stability of the cervical spine, and thereby improving neural outcome and preventing the progression of OPLL. Conclusions: The posterior indirect decompression and fixation has now been adopted as the primary treatment for cervical OPLL involving multiple levels with the canal occupancy by OPLL < 50 at our institution because this approach leads to significantly less implant failures. Those patients with the occupancy >= 50 managed with anterior approach surgeries had better outcomes, but approach was more difficult and associated with higher risk and complications.

The purpose of our study was to compare the biomechanical stability of acetabular fragments fixed in place with 3 titanium screws, or with 2 or 3 bioabsorbable screws composed of particulate resorbable uncalcined hydroxyapatite (HA) and poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) termed HA/PLLA screws. Methods: Curved periacetabular osteotomy was performed on 24 composite model hemipelves. Three groups of 8 specimens were affixed with 1) 3 titanium screws, 2) 2 HA/PLLA screws, or 3) 3 HA/PLLA screws. After fixation, the hemipelves were biomechanically attested with simulated push-off phase of the gait cycle using a servohydraulic material testing system. Results: The average failure loads were not significantly different among the3 groups tested. However, the group repaired with 3 HA/PLLA screws showed significantly greater stiffness than the other groups. Conclusions: All 3 fixation methods provided sufficient stability to allow for early partial weight-bearing after surgery. The use of 3 HA/PLLA screws provided significantly greater stiffness for acetabular fragment fixation.

Methods: Radiological morphometry was analyzed in 51 adult patients with unilateral isolated zygomatic arch fractures. Frequent fracture sites, sites of minimal thickness and height, and their correlation were evaluated, as were the locations and dimensions of fixation vantage points. The novel surgical method based on the results was implemented in 17 clinical cases. Results: Frequent fracture sites, occurring 4.40, 16.47 and 30.48 mm posterior to the arch origin, did not correlate to sites of minimal height and thickness. Arch minimal thickness and height locations were 12.23 and 27.09 mm behind its origin, respectively. Fixation vantage point dimensions varied from point to point, with upper thickness ranging from 1.67 to 4.86 mm and mid-portion thickness ranging from 2.06 to 7.36 mm, and height ranging from 8.99 to 22.53 mm. Arch vertical axis inclination ranged from 6.51 degrees to 16.47 degrees, which increased as the arch stretches posteriorly. These results suggested the use of 1.5 mm-wide plates and 1 mmdiameter screws with 6-8 mm length. Patients received surgery based on these morphometry results for satisfactory stabilization. Conclusions: This study introduces a new method for open reduction and internal fixation of arch fractures, with morphometric analysis of the arch verifying the validity of tangential plate application to the upper border.

Operative treatment is effective in patients who are unable to ambulate due to pain. Anterior subcutaneous internal fixation (ASIF) is a minimally invasive and stable fixation used to treat the FFPs, with few reported vascular complications. However, we experienced a case in which the rod directly pressed the common femoral artery (CFA). Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the rod position as defined by ASIF and the CFA in the FFPs patients, and between BMI and the rod-to-CFA distance. Materials and methods: Pelvic measurements were performed in 47 patients with FFPs using trauma CT. We identified the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS) on both sides in axial CT images. Next, we performed a simulation study using the CT images, in which the virtual fixation rod was bent according to the shape of the patients' abdomen in the supine position. The shortest rod-to-CFA distance when the virtual rod was positioned directly above the AIIS in the CT image was measured. The correlation between body mass index (BMI) and the rod-to-CFA distance was measured. Results: The average shortest rod-to-CFA distance was 18.4 +/- 11.1 mm, and the simulated rod compressed the CFA in three of the 47 cases (6.4%). A statistically significant positive correlation between BMI and the rod-to-CFA distance was found ( r = 0.47, p = 0.001). Conclusions: The course of the CFA should be confirmed before ASIF surgery, and if there is danger of compression of the CFA such as in patients with low BMI, the rod-to-AIIS distance should be adjusted to the optimal distance. However, considering the disadvantages, such as decreased stability of the fixation, when adjusting the rod-to-AIIS distance, and skin irritation and abrasion by the rod, ASIF is not recommended in cases in which the rod is close to the CFA.

Infrequently, symptomatic rib fracture nonunions are a complication after rib fractures. There is a paucity of literature on the surgical treatment of rib fracture nonunion. The purpose of this study was to describe the efficacy of rib fracture nonunion operative fixation with particular focus on surgical technique, healing rates, and complications. Materials and methods Patients aged >= 18 years with symptomatic rib fracture nonunions treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with locking plates at a single urban level 1 trauma center were retrospectively reviewed. Pertinent demographic, clinical, radiographic, and surgical data were collected and analyzed. Results A total of 18 patients met inclusion criteria. The mean time from injury to undergoing ORIF for rib fracture nonunion was just under a year and the number of ribs plated was 2.95 +/- 1.16 (1-5 ribs) with bone grafting used in six cases. All patients (100%) showed evidence of healing at an average of 2.65 +/- 1.50 months (2-8 months). All patients reported a decrease in pain. No narcotic pain medication was used at an average of 3.88 +/- 3.76 weeks (0-10 weeks) post-operatively. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were found in 4 (22.2%) patients. Conclusion This study concluded that operative fixation of symptomatic rib fracture nonunion demonstrated favorable outcomes with reduction in preoperative pain levels, decreased use of narcotic pain medication, minimal complications, and a high rate of fracture union. This described method provides symptomatic relief, reduction in pain, and promotes bony healing of the fracture nonunion without development of major complications. We suggest that operative fixation should be considered as the primary method of treatment of symptomatic rib nonunions.

Good postoperative results motivated the direct application of mandible fixation principles to the fractured midface region without additional experimental research. However, the amount and distribution of the forces in the midface region is different from those on the mandible. Materials and Methods: Testing was conducted on plastic anatomic models. The validity of the experimental model was tested before the fixation techniques were compared. Standard miniplates and miniscrews were used for fixation of the maxilla. The model surface strain analysis was conducted using the noncontact object grating method, which enabled the surface strain measurement without direct influence on the measured model. Results: In 2 screw pair fixation, the outer screw pair has little effect on the local strain distribution, but it lowers the contact forces along the crack. One screw pair fixation is stable enough for fixation, but it has a greater strain peak at the crack edges. Conclusion: Our results showed that 1 screw pair per plate was enough for stable fixation, and 2 or more screw pairs should only be used when the bone fragment at the fracture site cannot sufficiently transmit forces along the crack.

There has been a long lasting controversy on the superiority of different treatment options with endoscopic-assisted transoral approaches gaining increasing attention in recent years. In this article, we report the application of a newly developed osteosynthesis plate for an auto reposition, reconstruction and rigid fixation of condylar process fractures. Material and methods: We present 6 cases of uni- or bilateral fractures of the condylar process treated with a transoral open reduction and rigid fixation using an auto reposition plate. Via a transoral endoscopic assisted approach the proximal condyle fragment is captured using an anatomical defined clinch of the cranial part of the plate. The reposition of the condyle is facilitated with the distal bridge of the plate ranging around the posterior part of the ascending ramus. Results: The results show a sufficient reposition, rigid fixation and no facial nerve palsy or postoperative long-term occlusal disturbances. The mean operating time was 86 min. Conclusion: Transoral endoscopic-assisted surgery with application of an auto reposition, reconstruction and fixation plate offers a quick and convenient way for open reconstruction and rigid fixation of condylar process fractures.

The models were generated using skull CT scan data. Le Fort I osteotomy Simulations were made and two separate impacted maxillary models were designed. The ADV-2 model has 2 plate fixations bilaterally at the piriform rims, the ADV-4 model has 4 plate fixations at the zygomatic buttresses and piriform rims. The stress fields on bone, plate and screws were computed for each model. Posterior occlusal loads were simulated on one side in the molar-premolar region, in all three directions, reflecting the chewing forces. The increased locations of highest Von Mises stresses on the plates and highest maximum principle stresses on the bones were determined in ADV-2 models especially Under horizontal and oblique loads when compared with ADV-4 models. Evaluation of the highest Von Mises Stress Values and maximum principal stress revealed that oblique load in the ADV-2 model received the highest values. 4-plate fixation following Le Fort I advancement Surgery exerts less stress on the maxillary bones and fixation materials than 2-plate fixation.

The method is compatible with standard fixation techniques that leave the sample dry, such as finishing with super critical CO2 drying, or simple vacuum drying up to 95 degrees C. We demonstrate this technique can be applied on tooth and brain tissue samples. We also show that high resolution X-ray tomography can be performed on biological systems using Zn K edge (1s) absorption to enhance internal structures, and obtained the first nanoscale 10 KeV X-ray absorption images of the interior regions of a tooth.

On 160 porcine mandibles, four different monocortical. plating techniques (40 per group) were investigated. Condyles were fractured at a defined location from the incisure to the posterior border. After correct anatomical reduction the fractures were plated, using four different techniques. Osteosynthesis materials used were the delta plate, the trapezoid plate, the dynamic compression plate and double mini-plates. Each group was subjected to Linear loading in lateral to medial, medial. to lateral, anterior to posterior and posterior to anterior directions by a universal mechanical. testing machine TIRAtest 2720. Yield load, yield displacement were measured for the different plates. Statistically significant differences were noted between the fixation groups in all four directions. Rigid internal fixation with double mini plates showed the best stability in all. directions except posterior to anterior. In this direction, the delta-plate resisted the highest loads. In the three other directions, the delta plate was second best with data similar to double miniplates but lower in magnitude. (C) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Materials and methods: A comprehensive electronic search of PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library databases was conducted up to October 31, 2018. The evaluated functional outcomes included malocclusion, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain, protrusion, laterotrusion, maximum inter-incisal opening and lateral deviation during maximum inter-incisal opening. Results: Fourteen studies appeared to meet the inclusion criteria. Statistically significant differences between ORIF and CR treatment were observed for the outcomes of malocclusion (P = 0.001), maximum inter-incisal opening (P = 0.0008), lateral deviation during maximum inter-incisal opening (P = 0.007) and laterotrusion (P < 0.0001), but not for the outcomes of protrusion (P = 0.33) and TMJ pain (P = 0.29). Conclusions: ORIF treatment of unilateral mandibular extra-capsular condylar fractures provides better functional outcomes in comparison to CR treatment with regard to occlusion, maximum inter-incisal opening, lateral deviation during maximum inter-incisal opening and laterotrusion, whereas there was no statistically significant difference between ORIF and CR group with regard to protrusion and TMJ pain.

Open reduction internal fixation versus percutaneous iliosacral screw fixation for unstable posterior pelvic ring disruptions	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Open reduction internal fixation; Closed reduction percutaneous fixation; Iliosacral screw fixation; Posterior pelvic ring disruption	CLOSED REDUCTION; FRACTURES; INJURIES; CLASSIFICATION; COMPLICATIONS; UPDATE	Background: Surgical stabilization of posterior pelvic ring fractures can be achieved by either open or closed methods. They all provide a comparable biomechanical stability. The aim of the present study is to compare the clinical results of both techniques for treating posterior pelvic ring injuries. Material and methods: Seventy patients operated for unstable posterior pelvic ring disruptions were retrospectively reviewed. We compared 35 patients treated by open reduction internal fixation (ORIF group) versus 35 patients stabilized by using closed reduction and percutaneous iliosacral screw fixation (CRIF group) under fluoroscopic guidance. Results: According to pelvic outcome scoring system of Pohlemann et al., 28 patients out of the ORIF group obtained good or excellent results (20 excellent and 8 good), five fair and two poor. In the CRIF group, 30 patients obtained good or excellent results (25 excellent and 5 good), four fair and one poor (P= 0.64). The average intraoperative blood loss in the ORIF group was 500 cc with average blood transfusion of 2 units (1000 cc) compared to blood loss 150 cc in the CRIF group, with average blood transfusion of 1 unit (500 cc) (P=0.002). No intraoperative complications were reported in the ORIF group while operative guide wires were broken in two cases in the CRIF group (P= 0.16). There were no neurological complications observed in the ORIF group, but one radiculopathy (L5 root palsy) occurred in the CRIF group (P= 0.317). In the ORIF group, three patients had superficial wound infection and one patient had deep infection while in the CRIF group, we noted only one case of deep infection (P=0.083). Conclusion: No difference was noticed between ORIF and CRIF. The technical decision is variable according to time of surgery, fracture types, patient general condition, skin condition, presence of ipsilateral fractures of the acetabulum and feasibility of the closed reduction. More studies are needed to identify prognostic factors related to quality of the reduction. We need for creation of decisional algorithm for ORIF versus CRIF. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Material and Methods: 37 patients admitted to our hospital from April 2017 to April 2019 who received vancomycin drug delivery system were selected as the research group (RG). 39 patients only received routine antibiotic therapy as control group (CG). The recovery of bone infection and skeleton of patients were compared between the two groups. Results: The clearance rate of bone infection, reoperation rate and, fracture rehabilitation time in the RG were lower than those in the CG (p<0.050), while hip joint function, rehabilitation and bone mineral density (BMD) were higher than those in the CG (p<0.050). Multivariate results showed that age, both fracture, non : first injury and reoperation were independent risk factors affecting the rehabilitation of patients. Vancomycin slow-release drug therapy was independent protective factor affecting the rehabilitation of patients (p<0.050). Conclusions: Vancomycin drug delivery system can effectively improve the clearance rate of bone infection, accelerate the recovery of fracture and improve the bone health of patients to a certain extent for the treatment of bone infection after internal,fixation of femoral fracture. It has great application prospect in clinic in the future.

Materials and methods: Patients with mandibular condylar fractures who underwent ORIF via a 120 preauricular long-corniform incision were included in the study. A total of 78 patients (100 condyles) were included. Follow-up occurred 10 days and 1-6 months after surgery, and included assessments of clinical, functional outcome, complications, and bone fusion. Results: There were 38 high neck, 26 low base, and 35 diacapitular condylar fractures. All measures of functional outcome significantly improved over time after surgery regardless of fracture type (all P < 0.001). The vast majority of patients in all fracture type groups had good occlusion (>= 88.5%), no pain (>= 89.5%), and anatomical reduction 10 days after surgery (>= 81.6%). Fracture healing was complete in all patients after 6 months. There were no long-term complications and all patients were satisfied with their postoperative appearance. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a preauricular long-corniform incision provides a good visual field during surgery, and allows for effective ORIF of mandibular high neck, low base, and diacapitular condylar fractures, with positive outcomes and minimal postoperative complications.

This retrospective multicentric study evaluated outcome after treatment in patients aged over 75 years hospitalized for pertrochanteric fractures over a one year period (May 2004May 2005). Five University Hospitals in the cities of Angers, Brest, Rennes, Tours, Nantes participated in this evaluation. The quality of the reduction and the position of the osteosynthesis were the two main criteria for good outcome. The type of material implanted had little effect on outcome. The results emphasized the importance of preventing osteoporosis. Fracture prevention and treatment of osteoporosis are crucial, even after fracture.

Major and minor principal stresses in the cortical and cancellous bones, von Mises stresses in the fixation system (miniplate and monocortical screws), and bending angles of the miniplate were analysed.Results: Compressive and tensile stress distributions in the mandible and von Mises stress distributions in the fixation system were greater in models with a Class III IMF elastic direction and a higher IMF elastic force than in models with a Class II IMF elastic direction and a lower IMF elastic force. The bending angle of the miniplate was negligible.Conclusions: Stress distributions in the bone and fixation system varied depending on the direction, amount of force, and position of IMF elastics and MIs. Conclusively, IMF elastics in the Class II direction with minimal load in the area close to the osteotomy site should be recommended.

Hip salvage protocols include osteotomy and osteosynthesis using various implants and grafting techniques (muscle pedicle, vascularised or nonvascularised fibular graft). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of vascularised iliac grafting for femoral neck nonunion in patients younger than 50 years. Materials and methods: A total of 22 patients underwent vascularised iliac grafting and internal fixations for femoral neck nonunion were retrospectively analysed. Their mean age was 36.6 years. The cases were evaluated radiographically and clinically. Results: All the patients were followed-up for an average of 64.6 months. The mean time to union for all patients was 5.4 months. The mean Harris Hip Score had increased from 55.3 preoperatively to 85.2 at the latest follow-up. The average neck-shaft angle had changed from 127.4 degrees preoperatively to 128.3 degrees postoperatively. Postoperative progression of osteonecrosis of the femoral head was seen in 3 patients, 2 patients were pain free and 1 patient required total hip arthroplasty 9 years after the revision procedure. There was no further progression in 3 patients with preoperative radiological evidence of the femoral head osteonecrosis. Conclusions: This study indicates that vascularised iliac grafting is a viable option in treatment of femoral neck nonunion in the young adult.

To address this issue, a zygomatic fracture model produced by using a cadaveric cranium was simulated and the fractures were fixed by the actual and modified fixation materials. The force simulating masseter muscle pull was applied with the Lloyd material testing apparatus, and the rotation of the zygoma was determined using displacement transducers. In this study, there were three different experimental groups. Although miniplates at the zygomaticomaxillary buttress and microplates at the infraorbital rim were used in all three groups, three different plates (miniplate, microplate, and modified plate) were used at the frontozygomatic suture in these groups. Rotational displacement of the zygoma with the effects of simulated masseter muscle force was determined. According to the results obtained, microplates are not effective in stabilizing the frontozygomatic suture when the masseter muscle forces are within physiological range. Although miniplates stabilize zygomatic complex fractures, it was shown that modified microplates, which have no ondulation along the plate border, have a higher resistance to rotation than that of the conventional plates. The rotation angle at the instant of fracture with microplates was 4.59, and that with miniplates was 1.26. The maximum rotation angle with modified microplates was 0.32. Modified microplates designed for the fixation of fractures in the zygomatico-orbital region have been shown to be suitable in a well-designed experimental model and might be appropriate for clinical use.

Materials and methods: A total of 24 lamb cadaveric femurs that were osteotomized transversely from the mid-diaphysis with a bone saw were used to obtain a simple fracture model. The femurs were divided randomly into three groups. In Group 1, only plate-screw was used for fixation. In Group 2, plate-screw fixation was augmented with a 2.5-mm TEN. In Group 3, plate-screw fixation was augmented with two 2.5-mm TENs. Each bone model was positioned on a mechanical testing machine. Subsequently, three-point bending loads were applied to each bone to measure the force required for failure at the osteotomy site. The data were recorded on a computer connected to the test device and the bending strengths of all samples were calculated.Results: There was no statistically significant difference in the bending strength (megapascals) between Groups 1 and 2 or between Groups 2 and 3 (p>0.05). However, the bending strength in Group 3 was significantly higher than in Group 1 (p<0.05).Conclusion: The application of intramedullary TEN during surgery in long bone fractures, combined with a bridge plate, may be helpful to strengthen the fixation stability.

Bioabsorbable implants in the treatment of hand fractures - An update	CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH			English	Article							BIOMECHANICAL ANALYSIS; INTERNAL-FIXATION; METACARPAL; SYSTEMS; PLATES; RODS	Bioabsorbable implants have been used extensively in medicine. Many have suggested interest in these materials for hand fractures since they may lead to less implant morbidity and subsequent stiffness, and they have additional advantages: they are radiolucent, they eliminate hardware removal procedures, they limit stress shielding, and they incrementally transfer load to healing fractures. Disadvantages include weakness relative to metal implants, rapid loss of initial implant strength, higher refracture rates, and foreign body reactions. Newer polymers have led to a reduction in these complications and more stable fixation. While not yet incorporated into the armamentarium of most surgeons, there is promise that in the near future they may assist in the management of some hand fractures.

Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study of 270 RTSA. The inclusion criteria for this study consisted of patients initially treated with either open reduction and plate fixation (ORIF) or fixation using an intramedullary nail (IMN), who were managed with a single-stage revision to a RTSA, and had a minimum of 24 months clinical and radiological follow-up. Six patients with failed fixation of displaced PHF were revised with RTSA. One patient was excluded from the study because she died. Five shoulders were reviewed for the purpose of this study. The patients were evaluated using Constant score, relative Constant score and visual analogue scale for pain. Results: The mean follow-up was 89 months (65-108). The mean absolute Constant score improved from 31, 81 to 44, 2 and the relative Constant score improved from 31,81% to 67,2%. Mean VAS improved from 6, 8 to 2. One patient rated their outcome excellent, 1 good, 1 satisfied and 2 poor. Conclusion: RTSA is an appropriate treatment as a revision surgery for failed fixation of PHF. Patients should be adequately warned that they will improve their function but may have complications following this salvage procedure. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Materials and Methods: The treatment of these fractures remains very controversial. At the time of the choice of the surgical treatment, a wide range of accesses and of techniques of reduction and fixation is used, depending on the type of the fracture, the experience of the surgeon, and aesthetical issues. Among the difficulties posed by this type of fracture is the correct repositioning of the fractured condylar portion for which we have developed a technique that uses a neck screw, with intramedullary insertion. Because this is a round-headed screw, it is necessary to install a plate, which may be straight or "L" shape, and is placed perpendicular and superjacent to the screw so that it does not allow the rotation of the condylar portion. Results: Neck screw can be used, resulting in satisfactory stability, for the reduction and fixation of these fractures.

Raj			Open proximal phalangeal shaft fractures of the hand treated by theta fixation	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Hand fracture; interosseous wiring; Lister fixation; phalanx fracture; theta fixation	CLOSED REDUCTION; TRANSVERSE FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; PLATE FIXATION; SMALL BONES; METACARPAL; COMPLICATIONS; LOOP	Background: Many implants and techniques are used for the treatment of open phalangeal fractures with varying grades of stability. The ubiquitous and simple Kirschner (K) wiring does not provide adequate stability to allow early mobilization of fingers. Lister described a combination of coronal interosseous wire and oblique K-wire technique for phalangeal fracture fixation with a stable construct that allowed early mobilization. Due to the fancied resemblance of this construct to the Greek alphabet. (theta), we have referred to this as the theta fixation. Materials and Methods: Ten patients with open proximal phalangeal shaft (transverse) fractures were treated with theta fixation between January and June 2010. Outcome was analysed in terms of stability, early mobilization, fracture healing and function of hand. They were graded according to the Belsky score. Results: 90% patients were graded excellent and 10% good, with none having fair or poor results. All fractures allowed the mobilization at a mean of 2.9 days and all healed at an average of 6.1 weeks. No loss of stability was seen on followup X-rays. All patients returned to their old profession. Conclusion: The theta fixation technique is a safe, simple and effective method for open transverse phalangeal fractures with results comparable to other techniques. This method gives superior fracture stability to allow early mobilization of joints and thus early return of function. It is also a cost effective way of management for the developing world.

Material and methods In a retrospective study of patients operated for humerus shaft fractures from April 2008 to July 2011, the outcomes of 33 patients treated with CMR/MIPO were compared with the outcomes of 42 patients treated with ORIF. The fractures were classified, and the incision length, blood transfusion, operating time, as well as the VAS (Visual Analog Scale) pain scores were analyzed. The neck-shaft angles of the proximal humerus were detected, and the postoperative function of the shoulder was evaluated. Results The mean values of incision length, blood transfusion, and VAS pain scores at the 1st and 3rd day after CMR/MIPO and operation time were lower than that of ORIF. The postoperative radiographs verified good position of all screws and satisfactory bone fracture reduction in both groups. Meanwhile, in the ORIF group, nonunion (three cases) and humeral head necrosis (four cases) were detected. Conclusions The MR/MIPO technique showed smaller incisions, easier operation, less blood transfusion and more effective recovery of shoulder joint function for treating proximal humeral fractures than ORIF.

J	Chung, CY				Chung, Chen-Yuan			A simplified application (APP) for the parametric design of screw-plate fixation of bone fractures	JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS			English	Article						Application (APP); Analytical approach; Stress shielding; Interfragmentary strain	LOCKING COMPRESSION PLATE; INTERNAL FIXATORS; BIOMECHANICS; STABILITY; STIFFNESS; STRESSES; STRAIN	Screw and plate fixation is commonly used to treat bone fractures. A prototype application (APP) for presurgical simulation was developed and validated by comparing it with current analytical approach and other models. In this APP, alternative plate designs and materials to limit the effects of stress shielding could be tested. In addition, the number and position of screws and the gap between bone and plate that achieved acceptable stability were predicted. The fixation stability providing a situation of interfragmentary strain between 2% and 10% is necessary for callus formation. However, improving the fixation stability leads to a stress shielding effect. The simultaneous alleviation of stress shielding and maintenance of stability are important in fracture healing. In this study, the feasibility of creating a specialized APP to evaluate different screw-plate configurations for diaphyseal femoral fractures was investigated. The ultimate goal is to extend this technique to computer-assisted preoperative planning for orthopedic surgery.

Controversy still exists on the choice for instrumentation with spinal fusion procedures. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis exclusively of RCTs to compare the clinical outcomes of patients receiving bilateral versus unilateral pedicle screw fixation (PSF). Material/Methods: After systematic review of published and unpublished literature, a meta-analysis was conducted to compare the 2 treatment strategies. The methodological quality of the literature was assessed using the PEDro critical appraisal tool. Results: Data synthesis showed less blood loss (P<0.001) and shorter operative time (P<0.001) in patients receiving unilateral PSF compared to bilateral PSF. However, there was no significant difference in fusion rates and functional outcomes between the 2 groups. Conclusions: The meta-analysis indicated no significant difference in fusion rates and functional outcomes between the 2 treatment procedures, but unilateral PS fixation reduced blood loss and operative time.

Condylar base fracture related FEAs have been always published, but it is absent for the therapeutic effects of diverse implanting devices' locations and materials on osteosynthesis. The current FEA aimed to elucidate the biomechanical effects of unilateral mandibular condylar base fractures with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of different locations and materials. The implanting positions included posterolateral border of ramus (A), anterolateral border along sigmoid notch (B), and lateral border in the middle area (C). Two different materials were presented, titanium and u-HA/PLLA (Poly-L-lactic acid combined with uncalcined and unsintered hy-droxyapatite). For titanium, A + B presented lowest values of maximum von Mises stress in plates (198.66 MPa) and screws (237.39 MPa), and lowest value of peak displacement in the whole mandible (260.35 mu m), while A + C presented lowest value of maximum von Mises stress in cortical bone surrounding screws (65.96 MPa). For u-HA/PLLA, A + B presented lowest value of maximum von Mises stress in screws (134.15 MPa), and lowest value of peak displacement in the whole mandible (374.43 mu m), while A + C presented highest value of maximum von Mises stress in cortical bone surrounding screws (166.41 MPa). The findings suggest that both posterolateral border of mandibular ramus and anterolateral border along sigmoid notch are crucial for ORIF of unilateral mandibular condylar base fractures, whatever titanium or u-HA/PLLA devices. In addition, we speculate that titanium devices of position B could be adjusted backward and downward appropriately, but not for u-HA/PLLA device.

The palmar locking compression plate is biomechanically comparable to the dorsal Pi plate for dorsally comminuted, intraarticular wrist fractures	JOURNAL OF HAND SURGERY-BRITISH AND EUROPEAN VOLUME			English	Article						intraarticular; wrist fracture; palmar; locking plate; Pi plate	DISTAL RADIUS FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; EXTERNAL FIXATION; COLLES FRACTURES; VOLAR FIXATION; COMPLICATIONS; SYSTEM	A clinically appropriate fracture model and testing regimen were used to test the null hypothesis that a palmarly applied locking plate was inferior to a dorsally applied Pi plate in the stabilisation of dorsally comminuted intraarticular wrist fractures. Sixteen standardised fractures of Synbone models of the radius were stabilised using either a palmar locking compression T plate (the experimental group) (n = 8) or a dorsally applied Pi plate (the control group) (n = 8). The constructs were tested on an Instron materials testing machine. Deformation was monitored during 500 loading cycles to 200 N. The mean permanent deformation and stiffness favoured the palmar locking compression T plate over the dorsal Pi plate (P = 0.036). However, the absolute difference was only 0.5mm. Such a small difference is unlikely to be clinically detectable and, therefore, we conclude that there is no clinically significant difference between the two types of fixation.

The MMF can be performed with or without wire-based methods, rigid or manual MMF, respectively. The aim of this study was to compare the use of manual versus rigid MMF, in terms of occlusal outcomes and infective complications. Materials and MethodsThis multi-centric prospective study involved 12 European maxillofacial centres and included adult patients (age >= 16 years) with mandibular fractures treated with ORIF. The following data were collected: age, gender, pre-trauma dental status (dentate or partially dentate), cause of injury, fracture site, associated facial fractures, surgical approach, modality of intraoperative MMF (manual or rigid), outcome (minor/major malocclusions and infective complications) and revision surgeries. The main outcome was malocclusion at 6 weeks after surgery. ResultsBetween May 1, 2021 and April 30, 2022, 319 patients-257 males and 62 females (median age, 28 years)-with mandibular fractures (185 single, 116 double and 18 triple fractures) were hospitalised and treated with ORIF. Intraoperative MMF was performed manually on 112 (35%) patients and with rigid MMF on 207 (65%) patients. The study variables did not differ significantly between the two groups, except for age. Minor occlusion disturbances were observed in 4 (3.6%) patients in the manual MMF group and in 10 (4.8%) patients in the rigid MMF group (p > .05). In the rigid MMF group, only one case of major malocclusion required a revision surgery. Infective complications involved 3.6% and 5.8% of patients in the manual and rigid MMF group, respectively (p > .05). ConclusionIntraoperative MMF was performed manually in nearly one third of the patients, with wide variability among the centres and no difference observed in terms of number, site and displacement of fractures. No significant difference was found in terms of postoperative malocclusion among patients treated with manual or rigid MMF. This suggests that both techniques were equally effective in providing intraoperative MMF.

Materials and Methods: One hundred fifty-one patients with 208 ICFs diagnosed by panoramic radiograph and computed tomographic (CT) scan received open treatment in the TMJ division from 1999 to 2008. Their charts were reviewed. Classification of the fracture was based on coronal CT scan. Forty-three patients also underwent magnetic resonance imaging before the operation to check displacement of the disc. A modified preauricular approach was used for all patients. Various internal fixation methods from wire, to screw, to plate were evaluated for stability. Results: There were 110 ICFs of type A fracture, 60 of type B fracture, 9 of type C fracture, 25 of type M fracture, and 4 fractures without displacement. A modified preauricular approach was used for open treatment, which can better expose and protect the TMJ and superficial temporal vessels. Wire and plate is the commonly used stable fixation method for type A, B, and M fractures, which accounted for 56.7% (101/178). Small fracture fragments were removed with disc repositioning for all type C fractures (n = 9) and some type B (n = 9) and M fractures (n = 5). Three type M fracture and 3 nondisplaced ICFs were treated closed. Eighty-nine patients with 115 ICFs had postoperative CT scan, which showed anatomic and nearly anatomic fracture reduction rates of 95.6%. Thirty-five patients with 44 ICFs had long-term follow-ups from 3 months to 5 years. Among them, 63.2% (n = 12/19) pediatric ICFs had continuous condyle growth after open reduction and rigid fixation; 92% adults had ICFs that healed well (n = 23/25). Postoperative complications were facial nerve injury (n = 3), TMJ clicking (n = 1), and condyle resorption that required plate removal (n = 4). Conclusion: A modified preauricular approach provides better exposure and protection of the TMJ and superficial temporal vessels. Wire and plate provides stable fixation for type A and some type B and M fractures. Open reduction and rigid fixation produce good results for adult patients.

Materials and methods A chart and radiographic review of 25 cases that had proximal humeral internal locking system (PHILOS) plate for the treatment of proximal humeral fractures was performed. Results Of the 25 cases, 20 went to union with a mean neck/shaft angle of 127.2 degrees. Five cases required or were considered for revision surgery for non-union or implant failure. Of the 25 implants, 4 had screw protrusion into the gleno-humeral joint, 4 had screw loosening and backing out, and 1 plate broke without further trauma. Conclusions Our results suggest that PHILOS is an effective system for providing fracture stabilisation to bony union but awareness of potential hardware complications is essential.

The aim of this study was to design a bidirectional compression-limited sliding screw (BCLSC) that can achieve a full balance between retaining the sliding pressure of the ends of and maintaining the length of the femoral neck. Material/Methods: We constructed a 3-dimensional model of a Pauwels III femoral neck fracture and models of 3 internal fixation methods (3 cannulated screws [3CS], dynamic hip screw [DHS]+CS, and BCLSC) by finite element analysis (FEA). The finite element model simulated the loading of the human body when standing on 1 leg. Displacement and stress distribution of the models were calculated based on an axial stress of 600 N. Results: The peak von Mises stress (VMS) values of fracture ends in the 3CS, DHS+CS and BCLSC groups were 94.687 MPa, 26.375 MPa and 45.698 MPa; the peak VMS values of internal fixed stress were 451.53 MPa, 174.45 MPa, and 337.34 MPa; the peak VMS values of the lateral femoral wall were 70.021 MPa, 53.033 MPa, and 20.009 MPa; maximum displacements of the femoral head were 1.4482 mm, 1.3813 mm, and 1.3889 mm; and the internal fixed displacement peaks were 4.1134 mm, 3.91 mm, and 4.1004 mm, respectively. Conclusions: The FEA showed that compared with the CS, the new BCLSC showed better performance in resisting shearing force for Pauwels III femoral neck fracture, with better mechanical properties. These data provide a basis for further experiments and clinical application.

The material neither interferes with imaging nor with postoperative radiotherapy. The plates and screws do not need to be removed. The number of operations can be diminished and rehabilitation with dental implants shortened. The purpose of the present study was to report our experience with bioabsorbable osteosynthesis in the fixation of access osteotomies of the mandible. Patients and Methods: A total of 15 patients (11 men and 4 women, mean age 63.1 years) were enrolled in the present study. All patients had oral squamous cell carcinoma. Three patients developed tumor recurrence, 2 of whom had previously undergone radiotherapy. Nine patients had radiotherapy scheduled postoperatively. The osteotomies were a straight-line cut and were situated medially or paramedially. For fixation, SR-PLDLA miniplates and screws (Biosorb 2.0 and 2.4 systems) were used without any maxillomandibular fixation. Results: The follow-up ranged from 0.3 to 7.1 years (median 3.5). No problems were encountered during the operation. One patient required reoperation owing to failure in fixation. Twelve osteotomy lines (80%) were clinically stable; radiologically, 6 were totally and 3 partly consolidated. During follow-up, 6 nonunions were radiographically noted, 3 of which were clinically stable. Conclusions: Because of the high incidence of radiologic nonunion, bioabsorbable devices should not yet be used for fixation of access osteotomies in cancer surgery.

MATERIAL and METHODS: In this retrospective study, a total of 78 patients with TLBF were included and assigned to PSPFI (n=46) and PSPF (n=32) groups. The operative time, blood loss, perioperative complications, Oswestry disability index (ODI), and visual analog pain score (VAS) were examined immediately after surgery, 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year after surgery. Moreover, the postoperative vertebral height correction rate and postoperative Cobb angle correction rate were examined immediately and 1 year after surgery, as well as the corrected vertebral height loss rate and Cobb angle correction loss rate. RESULTS: No significant difference was identified in terms of operative time, blood loss, perioperative complications, ODI, and VAS after surgery (p>0.05) between the PSPFI and PSPF groups. Moreover, the postoperative vertebral height correction rate and postoperative Cobb angle correction rate showed no difference between the groups as well. However, the PSPFI group had a significantly lower loss rate in terms of corrected vertebral height loss rate and Cobb angle correction loss rate than the PSPF group 1 year after surgery (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: PSPFI and PSPF achieve similar clinical outcomes. However, posterior short -segment pedicle fixation with injured vertebra significantly maintains vertebral height correction rate and Cobb angle correction rate, which serve as a better choice for the treatment of TLBF.

Materials and Methods: Sixty polyurethane replicas of human hemimandibles were used as substrates, simulating a 5-mm setback surgery by sagittal split ramus osteotomy. These replicas served to reproduce 3 different techniques of fixation, including 1) a 4-hole plate and 4 monocortical screws (miniplate group), 2) a 4-hole plate and 4 monocortical screws with 1 additional bicortical positional screw (hybrid group), and 3) 3 bicortical positional screws in a traditional inverted-L pattern (inverted-L group). After fixation, hemimandibles were adapted to a test support and subjected to lateral torsional forces on the buccal molar surface and vertical cantilever loading on the incisal edge with an Instron 4411 mechanical testing unit. Peak loadings at 1, 3, 5, and 10 mm of displacement were recorded. Means and standard deviation were analyzed using analysis of variance and Tukey test with a 5% level of significance, and failures during tests were recorded. Results: Regardless of the amount of displacement and direction of force, the miniplate group always showed the lowest load peak scores (P < .01) compared with the other fixation techniques. The hybrid group demonstrated behavior similar to the inverted-L group in lateral and vertical forces at any loading displacement (P > .05). Molar load tests required more force than incisal load tests to promote the same displacement in the mandibular setback model (P < .05). Conclusion: For mandibular setback surgery of 5 mm, this study concluded that the fixation technique based on the miniplate group was significantly less rigid than the fixation observed in the hybrid and inverted-L groups. Mechanically, adding 1 bicortical positional screw in the retromolar region in the miniplate technique may achieve the same stabilization offered by inverted-L fixation for mandibular sagittal split ramus osteotomy setback surgery in vitro.

There is an ongoing debate about the necessity of fibular fixation when associated to distal third tibial fracture. This study aims at evaluating the role of fibular fixation in the treatment of distal third tibial fractures. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that fixation of the fibula increases the stability of fixation in distal third tibial and fibular fractures. Materials and methods: In a randomized clinical trial, 53 patients with concomitant fractures of tibia and ipsilateral fibula at distal third level were recruited in this study during a 23-month period. Patients were randomized in two groups: patients with fibular fixation (case group) and without fibular fixation (control group). The patients were followed up for at least 6 months postoperatively. Results: There were seven cases exhibiting malalignment on immediate postoperative radiographs. Six of them were in group II (control group) and one was in group I (case group) (P = 0.084). We didn't find nonunion in group I and we found three patients in group II (P = 0.141). Infection was one in group I and two in group II on gustillo II injuries (P = 0.516). Conclusion: Despite its low count of patients, our study didn't show any advantage to fix the fibula fracture associated to distal third of tibia diaphysis fracture. It didn't show either an increase of complication after fibula open reduction and internal fixation. Level of evidence: Level III. Randomized prospective study. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Cost minimization analysis of the treatment of distal radial fractures in the elderly	BONE & JOINT JOURNAL			English	Article							LOCKING PLATE FIXATION; NONOPERATIVE TREATMENT; FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; CLOSED REDUCTION; PATIENTS OLDER; UNITED-STATES; COMPLICATIONS; DISABILITY	Aims The aim of this study was to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference, from the payer perspective, in the cost of treatment of a distal radial fracture in an elderly patient, aged > 65 years, between open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and closed reduction (CR). Materials and Methods Data relating to the treatment of these injuries in the elderly between January 2007 and December 2015 were extracted using the Humana and Medicare Advantage Databases. The primary outcome of interest was the cost associated with treatment. Secondary analysis included the cost of common complications. Statistical analysis was performed using a non-parametric t-test and chi-squared test. Results Our search yielded 8924 patients treated with ORIF and 5629 patients treated with CR. The mean cost of an uncomplicated ORIF was more than a CR ($7749 versus $2161). The mean additional cost of a complication in the ORIF group was greater than in the CR group ($1853 versus $1362). Conclusion These findings show that there are greater payer fees associated with ORIF than CR in patients aged > 65 years with a distal radial fracture. CR may be a higher-value intervention in these patients.	[Pang, E. Q.; Harris, A. H. S.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA USA; [Pang, E.

The classification and treatment decision-making by 491 maxillofacial surgeons from around the world in three cases of a unilateral mandibular condyle fracture	JOURNAL OF CRANIO-MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article						Mandibular condyle fracture; Treatment decision; Agreement	MAXILLOMANDIBULAR FIXATION SCREWS; OPEN REDUCTION; INTERNAL-FIXATION; CLOSED TREATMENT; ORTHODONTIC BRACKETS; CURRENT THOUGHTS; MANAGEMENT; MULTICENTER; PATIENT; NECK	Purpose: Many studies are available in the literature on both classification and treatment of unilateral mandibular condyle fractures. To date however, controversy regarding the best treatment for unilateral mandibular condyle fractures remains. Material and methods: In this study, an attempt was made to quantify the level of agreement between a sample of maxillofacial surgeons worldwide, on the classification and treatment decisions in three different unilateral mandibular condyle fracture cases. Results: In total, 491 of 3044 participants responded. In all three mandibular condyle fracture cases, a fairly high level of disagreement was found. Only in the case of a subcondylar fracture, assuming dysocclusion was present, more than 81% of surgeons agreed that the best treatment would be open reduction and internal fixation. Conclusions: Based on the study results, there is considerable variation among surgeons worldwide with regard to treatment of unilateral mandibular condyle fracture. 3D imaging in higher fractures tends to lead to more invasive treatment decisions.

Although PPFs without implant loosening are usually managed by internal fixation, no consensus exists regarding the optimal construct. The primary objective of this study was to compare five constructs, and the secondary objective was to compare sub-groups of mono-cortical screw constructs, with the goal of identifying the method most appropriate for diaphyseal fracture fixation when prosthetic material is present within the intra-medullary canal. Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis was that fixation using bi-cortical screws, i.e., the current reference standard, was superior over other fixation methods. The secondary hypothesis was that adding double cerclage to mono-cortical screw fixation provided the greatest mechanical strength. Materials and methods: Synthetic osteoporotic bone was used to compare five methods for locking-screw fixation of a femoral diaphyseal plate. One method involved bi-cortical screws and four methods mono -cortical screws, with no cerclage wire, a single cerclage wire on either side positioned near or at a distance from the fracture, and two cerclage wires on both sides of the fracture. A complex fracture was simulated by creating a 2-cm diaphyseal gap. Load-to-failure was determined by applying compression loading along the anatomical axis of the femur. Results: Bi-cortical screw fixation provided greater mechanical strength than did three of the four mono -cortical screw constructs. The exception was the mono-cortical-screw and double-cerclage construct, for which no significant difference was found compared to bi-cortical screw fixation. Thus, mono-cortical screw fixation with double cerclage may be the best alternative when presence of an implant in the intra-medullary canal precludes bi-cortical screw fixation. Conclusion: The findings from this study have clear implications for clinical practice. The study hypotheses were partly confirmed. The absence of a significant difference between the reference-standard bi-cortical screw fixation method and mono-cortical screw fixation with double cerclage, combined with the results regarding the secondary objective, suggest that mono-cortical screws plus double cerclage deserve pref-erence in patients with an intra-medullary implant. Clinical studies are needed to assess the results of this bench study. Level of evidence: IV, bench study. (c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

MethodsPatients diagnosed with lateral malleolus fracture combined with both deltoid ligament injury and inferior tibiofibular syndesmotic disruption who received open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) were retrospectively reviewed. Seventy-eight patients were enrolled into the study, including 40 patients treated with lateral malleolus fracture ORIF and trans-syndesmotic fixation, and 38 patients treated with lateral malleolus fracture ORIF and deltoid ligament repair. Basic information and pre- and postoperative radiological materials were reviewed. Visual analog pain scale (VAS) score, Olerud-Molander score, and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot Scale were used for evaluating pain control and functional recovery postoperatively at different time points. ResultsNo complication was reported in both groups. In the trans-syndesmotic fixation group, all patients received syndesmotic screw removal 6-8 weeks postoperatively. The Olerud-Molander score and AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Scale in the deltoid ligament repair group were higher than the trans-syndesmotic fixation group 3 months after operation. No statistical difference was found between the two groups in VAS score from 1 to 12 months postoperatively. ConclusionsLateral malleolus fracture ORIF and deltoid ligament repair is an effective method for lateral malleolus fracture combined with both deltoid ligament injury and inferior tibiofibular syndesmotic disruption. Compared with trans-syndesmotic fixation, deltoid ligament repair holds the advantage of not needing surgical removal of inferior tibiofibular screws postoperatively.

As open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of condylar head fractures (CHFs) becomes more popular, the question of osteosynthesis removal is controversial. So far, information on volumetric changes after ORIF are available for a short-term period (<6 months) only. This study, therefore, was performed to assess bone resorption after condylar head fractures and to follow-up intermediate-term (>1 year) remodelling after removal of metallic osteosynthesis material. Furthermore clinical outcome was measured using Helkimo Index and put in relation with bone resorption. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 19 patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation of condylar head fractures at the University Hospital of Zurich between January 2016 and April 2018 using intraoperative cone-beam computed tomography repositioning control was conducted. The bone resorption on the condylar head was measured in the course after removal of osteosynthesis material by segmenting and superimposing of the postoperative 3D radiologic follow-up exam (T2) over the initial intraoperative cone-beam computed tomography (T1) using iPlan-CMF software. Complementary Helkimo index was assessed to put resorption rate in relation to clinical outcome. Results: A total of 19 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean follow-up time was 15.6 months and the mean bone resorption on the condylar head was -0.348cm(3) or -15.29% of segmented condylar head. There was no correlation of clinical outcome and bone resorption. Conclusions: Helkimo index showed satisfying results; therefore, ORIF of condylar head fracture proves as a feasible treatment option. The mean bone resorption rate of -15.29% in the intermediate-term follow-up time (mean 15.6 months) is comparable to findings of other studies with short-term follow-up time (< 6 months). Thus, postinterventional remodeling activity and resorption seems highest in the first 4 to 6 postoperative months with little further resorption. In prevention of negative sequelae of protruding implants, timing of osteosynthesis material removal after this period of high bone remodeling activity is recommended. The resorption rate showed no correlation to clinical outcome. (C) 2021 The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.	[Johner, Jean-Pierre; Essig, Harald; Wagner, Maximilian E.

Open reduction and internal fixation, specifically through compromised soft tissues, has historically been associated with major wound complications. Alternate methods of treatment have been described, each with its own merits and demerits. We performed a retrospective study to evaluate the functional outcome of lateral and medial plate fixation of Schatzker type V and VI fractures through an anterolateral approach, and a medial minimally invasive approach or a posteromedial approach. Materials and Methods: We treated 46 tibial plateau fractures Schatzker type V and VI with lateral and medial plates through an anterolateral approach and a medial minimal invasive approach over an 8 years period. Six patients were lost to followup. Radiographs in two planes were taken in all cases. Immediate postoperative radiographs were assessed for quality of reduction and fixation. The functional outcome was evaluated according to the Oxford Knee Score criteria on followup. Results: Forty patients (33 men and 7 women) who completed the followup were included in the study. There were 20 Schatzker type V fractures and 20 Schatzker type VI fractures. The mean duration of followup was 4 years (range 1-8 years). All patients had a satisfactory articular reduction defined as <= 2 mm step-off or gap as assessed on followup. All patients had a good coronal and sagittal plane alignment, and articular width as assessed on supine X-rays of the knee in the anteroposterior (AP) and lateral views. The functional outcome, as assessed by the Oxford Knee Score, was excellent in 30 patients and good in 10 patients. All patients returned to their pre-injury level of activity and employment. There were no instances of deep infection. Conclusions: Dual plate fixation of severe bicondylar tibial plateau fractures is an excellent treatment option as it provides rigid fixation and allows early knee mobilization. Careful soft tissue handling and employing minimal invasive techniques minimizes soft tissue complications.	[Prasad, G. Thiruvengita; Kumar, T. Suresh; Kumar, R.

This often misled surgeons and attention was given only to the medial and lateral column without consideration of the posterior column, especially the postero-medial corner. Luo in 2010 introduced the new three-column classification system based on multiplanar computed tomography images. This study was conducted to assess the outcome after internal fixation of tibial plateau fractures involving two or more columns in our centre based on the column specific approach. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective study conducted at our institute, between 2011 and 2016. Total of 183 patients with tibial plateau fractures involving two or more columns were admitted during this study period of which 123 patients were satisfied our inclusion criteria. 8 patients were lost to follow up. Hence 115 patients with tibial plateau fractures involving two or more columns were classified based on the new three column classification system. Dual column fixation (Anterolateral +Anteromedial) was done in 76 patients, (Anterolateral+Posteromedial) fixation in 25 patients and triple column fixation (Anterolateral + Anteromedial + Posteromedial) in 14 patients. Post operatively patients were assessed by Modified Rasmussen functional and radiological scoring system. Results: Based on Modified Rasmussen functional scoring system, 73 patients (63.5%) had excellent results, 37 patients (32.2%) had good results and 5 patients (4.3%) had fair results. Based on Modified Rasmussen radiological scoring system, 71 patients (61.7%) had excellent results, 38 patients (33.1%) had good results, 6 patients (5.2%) had fair results. 3 patients had deep infections. Conclusion: Based on our study, we like to conclude that we had good outcomes utilizing this modern column specific approach to the treatment of these two or more column tibial plateau fracture injuries, which includes assessment of three columns.

Material/Methods: Eleven male patients age 28 to 66 years old with medial-end clavicle fractures were included in the present study from October 2014 and October 2017. All the patients received operation of fixed with reversed lateral locking clavicle plates. In the operation, a curved incision approximately 8 to 10 cm in length was made, and after the reduction, the fracture was fixed by a reversed lateral locking clavicle plate. Postoperative follow-up was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment. Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score was used in evaluation the shoulder function post-operation. The functional assessment was performed by using the DASH score. Results: No intraoperative complications were found during the operation. All patients' incisions achieved healing after operations. Eleven cases were scored by DASH scoring after the operation; Of these, 9 patients were rated excellent, and 2 patients were rated good. There were no neurovascular injuries, nor were there any hemopneumothorax or internal fixation failures.

This study monitored a series of patients treated with a locking proximal humeral nail (PHN). Hypothesis: Fixation with a PHN can be an effective method when treating patients with two part surgical neck fractures of proximal humerus. Materials and methods: PHNs were used to surgically repair humeral neck fractures in 22 patients. Factors affecting the final function were analyzed by multiple linear regression. Results: Mean patient age at the time of surgery was 56.9 years. The mean follow-up was 25.4 months, and all fractures united within 8 weeks. The average active forward flexion was 147.3 degrees, the average external rotation was 44.1 degrees, and the average internal rotation was T10. All patients were satisfied with their results. Two factors associated with patient American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon scores were patient age and the strength of the supraspinatus. Discussion: Details in patients choosing and surgical management were discussed.

Along with the increases in operative management of VLP, the character and frequency of complications have changed. Thus, this multicentre study aimed to identify the characteristics of patients with DRFs who were treated with VLP fixation, describe the complication types and rates related to the procedure, and compare the results with those found in the literature. Material and methods This retrospective multicentre study was conducted between January 2008 and December 2017. In total, data from 2225 patients over 17 years old who underwent VLP fixation for DRF were screened. Patients with closed reduction and pinning, external fixation, dorsal plate fixation, and screw-only fixation were excluded. Finally, 1955 wrists from 1921 patients (86.3%) were included. The following types of complications were investigated: (1) tendon injury, (2) nerve-related, (3) fixation- and instrument-related, (4) osteosynthesis-related, (5) infection, and (6) others. Results The mean age of the patients was 60.3 +/- 14.6 years with 587 males (30.6%). Distal ulnar fractures were found in 940 wrists (48.1%). The mean interval between fracture and surgery was 6.2 days, while the mean operative time was 68.3 +/- 30.3 minutes. The following complications were found: (1) nine (0.46%) and 12 (0.61%) cases of flexor pollicis longus and complete extensor pollicis longus tears, respectively; (2) nine cases (0.46%) of palmar sensory median nerve branch damage, 15 cases (0.77%) of complex regional pain syndrome, and 36 cases (1.84%) of carpal tunnel syndrome; (3) five cases (0.26%) of fracture displacement even after plate fixation, six cases (0.31%) of screw breakage, 26 cases (1.33%) of radiocarpal joint screw penetration, and 511 cases (26.14%) of implant removal; (4) five cases (0.26%) of delayed union and three cases (0.15%) of non-union; (5) 83 (4.25%) and two (0.1%) cases of superficial and deep infection, respectively; and (6) two cases (0.1%) of compartment syndrome and three cases (0.15%) of radial artery damage. Conclusions After 10 years of experience performing VLP fixation for DRFs in a multicentre setting, the results regarding complication types and rates support its use as a reasonable treatment option with low rates of complication.

Here, we evaluated the osteogenesis and antibacterial effects of Ti6Al4V-6.5wt%Cu alloy in an in vivo model of infected bone defects and determine their responsible proteins and pathways using proteomics. Methods: After bone defects were filled with Ti6Al4V and Ti6Al4V-6.5wt%Cu implants for 6 week, the tissue and bone samples around the implants were harvested for radiographic, micro-CT, histological, and bone-related gene expression analyses. An iTRAQ-based protein identification/quantification approach was used to analyze the osteogenic and antibacterial effects of Ti6Al4V-6.5wt%Cu alloy. Results: Imaging and histological results showed Ti6Al4V alloy induced a stronger inflammatory response than Ti6Al4V-6.5wt%Cu alloy; imaging results and osteogenic protein levels showed Ti6Al4V-6.5wt%Cu alloy exerted a stronger osteogenic effect. In vitro experiment, we found the Ti6Al4V-6.5wt%Cu had significant antibacterial effects and inhibited the activity of Staphylococcus aureus in the early stage. In addition, the bacterial biofilm formed in Ti6Al4V-6.5wt%Cu group was significantly lower than that in Ti6Al4V group. Proteomic screening of 4279 proteins resulted in 35 differentially expressed proteins for further examination which were mainly associated with the cellular process, metabolic process, stimulus response, and cellular component organization. In further exploration of the mechanism of osteogenic mineralization of Ti6Al4V-6.5wt%Cu alloy, we found out SDC4 and AGRN were the top two target proteins associated with osteogenic differentiation and bone mineralization. Conclusion: Ti6Al4V-6.5wt%Cu alloy shows a great potential as a bone implant material due to its positive effects against bacterial infection and on bone formation. The Translational potential of this article: At present, titanium alloys and other non-antibacterial metal materials are used in orthopedic internal fixation operations. Our study demonstrates that Ti6Al4V-6.5wt%Cu alloy has good antibacterial and osteogenic effects in vivo and in vitro. This means that Ti6Al4V-6.5wt%Cu alloy may become a new kind of antimicrobial metallic material as internal fixation material to continuously exert its antimicrobial effects and reduce the infection rate after clinical internal fixation.

To address this issue, anterior transpedicular screw (ATPS) fixation has been developed and applied preliminarily to multilevel spinal fusion, osteoporosis, and three-column injury of the cervical spine. This study aimed to compare the biomechanical differences between unilateral ATPS (UATPS), bilateral ATPS (BATPS), and VBS fixation using finite element analysis.Materials and methods: A C6 corpectomy model was performed and a titanium mesh cage (TMC) and bone were implanted, followed by implantation of a novel ATPS-plate system into C5 and C7 to simulate internal fixation with UATPS, BATPS, and VBS. Internal fixation with UATPS comprises ipsilateral transpedicular screw-contralateral vertebral body screw (ITPS-CVBS) and cross transpedicular screw-vertebral body screw (CTPS-VBS) fixations. Mobility, the maximal von Mises stress on TMC, the stress distribution and maximal von Mises stress on the screws, and the maximum displacement of the screw were compared between the four groups.Results: Compared with the original model, each group had a reduced range of motion (ROM) under six loads. After ACCF, the stress was predominantly concentrated at two-thirds of the length from the tail of the screw, and it was higher on ATPS than on VBS. The stress of the ATPS from the cranial part was higher than that of the caudal part. The similar effect happened on VBS. The screw stress cloud maps did not show any red areas reflective of a concentration of the stress on VBS. Compared with VBS, ATPS can bear a greater stress from cervical spine movements, thus reducing the stress on TMC. The maximal von Mises stress was the lowest with bilateral transpedicular TMC and increased with cross ATPS and with ipsilateral ATPS. ITPS-CVBS, CTPS-VBS, and BATPS exhibited a reduction of 2.3%-22.1%, 11.9%-2.7%, and 37.9%-64.1% in the maximum displacement of screws, respectively, compared with that of VBS.Conclusion: In FEA, the comprehensive stability ranked highest for BATPS, followed by CTPS-VBS and ITPS-CVBS, with VBS demonstrating the lowest stability. Notably, utilizing ATPS for fixation has the potential to reduce the occurrence of internal fixation device loosening after ACCF when compared to VBS.

In France, percutaneous fixation with two lateral-entry pins is widely used after successful closed reduction. Post-operative immobilisation is typically with a long arm cast combined with a tubular-bandage sling that immobilises the shoulder and holds the arm in adduction and internal rotation to prevent external rotation of the shoulder, which might cause secondary displacement. The objective of this study was to compare this standard immobilisation technique to a posterior plaster splint with a simple sling. Hypothesis: Secondary displacement is not more common with a posterior plaster splint and sling than with a long arm cast. Material and methods: One hundred patients with extension Gartland type III SCHFs managed by closed reduction and percutaneous fixation with two lateral-entry pins between December 2011 and December 2015 were assessed retrospectively. Postoperative immobilisation was with a posterior plaster splint and a simple sling worn for 4 weeks. Radiographs were obtained on days 1, 45, and 90. Results: Secondary displacement occurred in 8% of patients. No patient required revision surgery. Discussion: The secondary displacement rate was comparable to earlier reports. Of the 8 secondary displacements, 5 were ascribable to technical errors. The remaining 3 were not caused by rotation of the arm and would probably not have been prevented by using the tubular-bandage sling. Conclusion: A posterior plaster splint combined with a simple sling is a simple and effective immobilisation method for SCHFs provided internal fixation is technically optimal.

J	Richardson, M; Asadollahi, S; Richardson, L				Richardson, Martin; Asadollahi, Saeed; Richardson, Louise			Management of acute displaced midshaft clavicular fractures using Herbert cannulated screw: Technique and results in 114 patients	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SHOULDER SURGERY			English	Article						Acute fracture; Herbert cannulated screw; internal fixation; intramedullary; midshaft clavicle fractures; open reduction	FIXATION	Purpose: A new and simple operative technique has been developed to provide internal fixation for midshaft clavicle fractures. This involves the use of a large fragment Herbert Screw that is entirely embedded within the bone. Screw fixation is combined with bone grafting from intramedullary reamings of the fracture fragments. The purpose of this report is to assess the outcomes following treatment of midshaft clavicular fracture using this method. Materials and Methods: One hundred and fourteen patients with acute displaced midshaft fracture were identified between 2002 and 2007. All patients were followed until fracture union. Patients medical records were reviewed. Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (DASH), and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Elbow form (ASES) were posted to all patients. Outcome measures included union rate, time to union, implant removal rate, DASH, and ASES scores. Results: Patients median age was 29.5 years (interquartile range, 19-44 years). The most common injury mechanism was sports injury (28%). The median time from injury to surgery was 5 days (interquartile range, 2-9 days). Union occurred in an average of 8.8 weeks. Non-union occurred in three cases (2.6%). The re-operation rate for symptomatic hardware prominence screw was 1.7%. The median DASH score was 0.83 and the median ASES was 100 (n = 35). Conclusions: Intramedullary fixation using cannulated Herbert screw can be used as an effective approach for operative management of midshaft clavicular fractures. Using this method, an appropriate outcome could be achieved and a second intervention for implant removal could be avoided in great majority of cases. Level of Evidence: Level III.

However, the literature regarding the prognosis of surgery in this elderly group is limited. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the results of patients above 80 years. old who underwent operative fixation for unstable ankle fractures. Materials and Methods: Ninety-two consecutive patients, 80 females and 12 males, above 80 years of age had open reduction and internal fixation for unstable ankle fractures during. the period of January 1998 to August 2007. The data was collected retrospectively from the case records and radiographs. The complications were noted and the risk factors for poor outcome were analyzed. The average age was 85.2 (range, 80.1 to 95.1) years. The minimum duration of followup was 9 months, with an average of 15 (range, 9 to 28) months. Results: The most common fracture pattern was Danis-Weber B type. The superficial wound infection rate was 7% (6 cases) and the deep infection rate was 4.6% (4 cases). The 30 day postoperative mortality was 5.4% (five cases). Eighty-six percent (75 out of 87 cases) were able to return back to their pre injury mobility at the last followup. Diabetes, dementia, peripheral vascular disease and smoking were found to be statistically significant risk factors associated with wound complications. Conclusion: The results of operative fixation of unstable ankle fractures were encouraging with good functional recovery and return to pre injury mobility status in most cases.

There is no gold standard for surgical management of these complex fractures. The purpose of this study was to compare the biomechanical stability and strength of two different internal fixation techniques for complex coronal plane fractures of the capitellum with posterior comminution. Materials and methods Fourteen fresh frozen, age- and gender-matched cadaveric elbows were 3D-navigated osteotomized simulating a Dubberley type IIB fracture. Specimens were randomized into one of two treatment groups and stabilized with an anterior antiglide plate with additional anteroposterior cannulated headless compression screws (group antiGP + HCS) or a posterolateral distal humerus locking plate with lateral extension (group PLP). Cyclic testing was performed with 75 N over 2000 cycles and ultimately until construct failure. Data were analyzed for displacement, construct stiffness, and ultimate load to failure. Results There was no significant difference in displacement during 2000 cycles (p = 0.291), stiffness (310 vs. 347 N/mm; p = 0.612) or ultimate load to failure (649 +/- 351 vs. 887 +/- 187 N; p = 0.140) between the two groups. Conclusions Posterolateral distal humerus locking plate achieves equal biomechanical fixation strength as an anterior antiglide plate with additional anteroposterior cannulated headless compression screws for fracture fixation of complex coronal plane fractures of the capitellum. These results support the use of a posterolateral distal humerus locking plate considering the clinical advantages of less invasive surgery and extraarticular metalware.

Management of Tibial Shaft Fractures Distal to TKA Prosthesis by Intramedullary Nail: A Report of Three Cases	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Total knee arthroplasty; Tibia fracture; Periprosthetic fracture; Intramedullary nailing	FIXATION; PLATE	Introduction Diaphyseal tibial fractures distal to a well-fixed tibial component although rare present a significant challenge and optimal treatment remains controversial. Displaced periprosthetic tibial shaft fractures are ideally treated with open reduction internal fixation with plate osteosynthesis. However, this treatment method is associated with weight-bearing restrictions, which can be difficult for elderly patients with multiple comorbidities and balance impairment. We present our experience of internal fixation with an intramedullary nail that uses an inferior entry point, standard intramedullary tibial nail, and conventional instrumentation. Materials and methods Between 2017 and 2018, three patients with acute tibial shaft fractures distal to a TKA (Felix Type 3A) were treated with an intramedullary nail. Preoperative planning involved assessing proximal tibia to ensure adequate room for implant and instrumentation. The average patient age was 66.3 years (range 59-72 years) and all patients were males. All the patients sustained fractures of distal tibial and fibula diaphysis, after a road traffic accident. There were no complications intraoperatively, and all procedures were completed uneventfully. One patient underwent additional fixation of the fibula. Results All patients achieved a radiological fracture union after an average of 20.6 weeks. There were no fixation failures, or nonunions postoperatively. There were no new symptoms relative to the TKA that could be attributed to the tibial nailing procedure. Conclusion We recommend that this technique can be used primarily for this fracture pattern distal to a TKA, provided there is adequate space to accommodate the nail and instrumentation proximally anterior to the tibial tray.

Studies on the Colorado Plateau have shown that an incomplete internal N cycle operates in BSCs that results in significant exports of dissolved organic N, ammonia and nitrate into the bulk soil through percolating water, thus mechanistically explaining their role as a N gateway. It is not known if this pattern is found in other arid regions. To examine this, we measured rates of major biogeochemical N-transformations in a variety of BSCs collected from the Colorado Plateau and the Mojave, Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts. Dinitrogen fixation and aerobic ammonia oxidation were prominent transformations at all sites. We found anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox) rates to be below the detection limit in all cases, and at least 50-fold smaller than rates of N-2-fixation, making it an irrelevant process for these BSCs. Heterotrophic denitrification was also of little consequence for the flow of N, with rates at least an order of magnitude smaller than those of N-2-fixation. Thus we could confirm that despite the demonstrable differences in microbial community composition and soil material, BSCs from major biogeographic regions in arid North America displayed a remarkably consistent pattern of internal N cycling. The implications for arid land fertility drawn from previous studies in the Colorado Plateau appear applicable to BSCs across other arid regions of the Southwestern United States.

Medial Spike and Obesity Associate with Open Reduction in Type III Supracondylar Humeral Fracture	ACTA CHIRURGIAE ORTHOPAEDICAE ET TRAUMATOLOGIAE CECHOSLOVACA			English	Article						supracondylar humerus; open reduction; obesity; medial spike angle	CHILDHOOD OBESITY; CLOSED REDUCTION; RISK-FACTOR; CHILDREN	PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Although supracondylar humeral fractures represent a major part of the pediatric fractures, no classification system or radiological characteristics describes which supracondylar fractures require open reduction. We aim to evaluate the factors that lead us to perform open reduction during operation. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively evaluated 57 patients who underwent operation for type III supracondylar fracture, and divided them into two groups; those with open reduction and internal fixation, and those with closed reduction and percutaneous fixation. The two groups were compared based on age, gender, BMI by age, medial spike angle of the fracture, medial spike-skin distance and rotation angle between the fractured fragments. RESULTS Of all patients, 46 (81.71%) underwent closed reduction and percutaneous fixation (CRPF) and 11 (19.29%) were treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). BMI by age was remarkably higher in the ORIF group (p = 0.00). And medial spike angle was smaller in the ORIF group (p = 0.014). DISCUSSION Closed reduction and percutanous fixation is the main treatment of supracondylar humeral fractuers. Open reduction in supracondylar humeral fractures could be associate with complications and cosmetic lesions. Many studies indicates that obesity is high risk factor for complex fractures as well as preoperative and postoperative complications. A prominant medial spike could associate with muscle entrapment, and obliquity of the fracture line. It could be also an indirect finding of instablity of the fracture. CONCLUSION We suggest that a smaller medial spike angle and a higher BMI in children with Type III supracondylar humeral fractures may require open reduction, and it is unreasonable to avoid open reduction in cases where closed reduction is not achieved.

Compression Forces of Internal and External Ankle Fixation Devices with Simulated Bone Resorption	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Arthrodesis; Intramedullary Nail; External Fixation; Compression; Resorption	RETROGRADE INTRAMEDULLARY NAIL; TIBIOTALOCALCANEAL ARTHRODESIS; BIOMECHANICAL EVALUATION; HINDFOOT ARTHRODESIS; PRIMARY STIFFNESS; SCREW FIXATION; RING FIXATORS; FUSION	Background: Internal and external fixation techniques have been developed to provide rigidity and stability to a fusion site such as in tibiotalocalcaneal (TTC) arthrodesis. Compression of the fusion site plays an integral role in primary bone healing, though little work has been done to quantify the compressive force values of ankle fixation devices. Materials and Methods: Using synthetic and cadaveric bone models, a Newdeal/Integra PantaNail and DePuy VersaNail were tested as compressive intramedullary (IM) nails while an Encore True/Lok and an Ace-Fischer frame were tested as external fixators. Results: The PantaNail experienced maximum compressive loads of 1898 and 1255 N in synthetic and cadaveric constructs, respectively. The VersaNail experienced max compressive loads 388 N during installation. All IM nails tested experienced decreased compressive loads after removal of the external guide and instrumentation. The external fixators were loaded to approximately 1200 N in both synthetic and cadaveric constructs. The decrease in compressive load was recorded as a function of simulated fusion site bone resorption for all devices. The IM nails experienced a 90% reduction in load with less than 1 mm of resorption, while the external fixators held 50% load for over 4 turn of resorption. These data were verified using a simple constitutive model of IM nails and external fixators. Conclusion: Intramedullary nails are capable of generating compression, however, are unable to provide sustained compression for any considerable amount of resorption. External fixators are inherently capable of applying and sustaining greater amounts of compression. Clinical Relevance: Surgeons who perform TTC arthrodesis procedures should be aware of a device's ability to generate and sustain compression with respect to bone resorption.

Quality and Utility of Immediate Formal Postoperative Radiographs in Ankle Fractures	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						ankle fracture; radiographs; postoperative imaging; radiation exposure; cost	X-RAYS; CLASSIFICATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; FIXATION; SURGERY	Background: Patients who undergo internal fixation of ankle fractures commonly have postoperative imaging performed immediately after surgery. As these patients typically are typically immobilized, radiographs provide limited visualization. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility and quality of formal radiographs performed immediately following ankle fracture surgery. Methods: Ankle fractures undergoing open reduction and internal fixation at a single institution from January 1, 2011, to January 1, 2013, were reviewed. Intraoperative and formal postoperative radiographs were evaluated using defined parameters. The postoperative images were compared with the intraoperative fluoroscopic images in terms of quality. Postoperative complications were evaluated in terms of fracture displacement, hardware malpositioning, and need for return to the operating room. A total of 411 patients with 413 ankle fractures underwent surgical fixation, with 271 patients undergoing formal postoperative radiographs. Results: Twenty-eight patients (10.3%) had 3 good quality postoperative views of the ankle, with the lateral (35.2%) and mortise (41.3%) views least commonly performed with good technique. None of the patients without radiographs had a complication that could have been detected earlier using postoperative radiographs. No patients required return to the operating room based on immediate postoperative radiographs. Postoperative radiographs cost $191 per patient. Conclusion: The routine use of formal postoperative radiographs prior to discharge from the hospital did not provide additional value to the patient or orthopedic surgeon. The quality of these images was generally inferior to the quality of those obtained and saved intraoperatively due to malrotation and overlying cast material. To reduce cost and radiation exposure, formal postoperative radiographs should be obtained only in specific circumstances, such as increasing postoperative pain, marginal fixation, or instability.

Materials and methods Nineteen patients with L5 neurological burst fractures were consecutively enrolled; 6 patients had complete motor deficits, and 12 had sphincter dysfunction. We performed 18 posterior and one combined approaches. To avoid kyphosis, posterior internal fixation was achieved by positioning patients on the operating table with hips and knees fully extended. At the latest follow-up (mean 22 months, range 10-66), neurological recovery, canal remodeling and L4-S1 angle were evaluated. Results Vertebral body replacement was difficult, which therefore resulted in an oblique position of the cage. Vertebral bodies still remained deformed, even though fixation allowed for an acceptable profile (22 degrees, range 20-35). We observed three cases of paralysis, five complete, and three incomplete recoveries. In the remaining eight patients, sphincter impairment was the only finding. In 15 patients, pain was absent or occasional; in four individuals, it was continuous but not invalidating. Remodeling was visible by X-ray and/or CT, without significant secondary stenosis. Conclusions The L5 burst fractures are rare and mostly due to axial compression. Cauda and/or nerve root injuries are absolute indications for surgery. If an anterior approach is technically difficult, laminectomy can allow for decompression, and it can be easily combined with transpedicular screw fixation. Posterior instrumented fusion, also performed with the aim to restore sagittal profile, when associated with an accurate spinal canal exploration and decompression, may be looked at as an optimal treatment for neurological L5 burst fractures.

Design: Case series. Setting: Academic Level I trauma center. Patients/Participants: During a 2-year period between January 2007 and December 2008, 10 consecutive patients (mean age, 59.8 years) with distal pole fractures of the patella (Orthopaedic Trauma Association 45.A.1) were prospectively enrolled in this study. Intervention: All 10 patients underwent vertical skin exposure, fracture open reduction, and internal fixation by anterior tension band wiring through 4.0-mm cannulated screws. Main Outcome Measurements: The range of motion, loss of fracture reduction, implant migration, material failure, soft tissue irritation, and Bostman score and Short Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment dysfunction score were primary outcome measures. Results: There were three single-fragment fractures and seven comminuted fractures. With 1-year follow-up, all fractures healed clinically in an average of 8 weeks and radiographically on average by 12 weeks. The average range of knee motion arc was 122.5 degrees (range, 95 degrees-140 degrees). Five patients have an average flexion lag of 17 degrees (range, 10 degrees-30 degrees). No patient had loss of fracture reduction, implant migration, material failure, or soft tissue irritation. The average Bostman score was 28.7 out of 30 (range, 27-30), and average Short Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment dysfunction score was 24.1 out of 100 (range, 15-39). All 10 patients stated they were highly satisfied. Conclusion: Anterior tension band wiring through cannulated screws for displaced inferior pole patella fractures is a safe, simple, and reliable alternative treatment with minimal soft tissue irritation. Good functional results and recovery can be expected.

Material and methods: A 3D printer is used to create customized MRI compatible components, a loop-coil platform and a multipart mouse fixation. The mouse fixation is custom fit for a dedicated coil and facilitates head fixation with bite bar, anesthetic gas supply and biomonitoring sensors. The mouse fixation was tested in a clinical 3T scanner. Results: All parts were successfully printed and proved MR compatible. Both design and printing were accomplished within a few days and the final print results were functional with well defined details and accurate dimensions (Delta < 0.4 mm). MR images of the mouse head clearly showed reduced motion artifacts, ghosting and signal loss when using the fixation. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that a low budget 3D printer can be used to quickly progress from a concept to a functional device at very low production cost. While 3D printing technology does impose some restrictions on model geometry, additive printing technology can create objects with complex internal structures that can otherwise not be created by using lathe technology. Thus, we consider a 3D printer a valuable asset for MRI research groups. (C) 2014 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recently, 3D image analyses begin to be used to evaluate surgical changes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate, using 3D vector analysis, the stability of bicortical bioabsorbable screw fixation in mandibular setback using a sagittal split ramus osteotomy. Spatial change of the mandibular condyle was determined by 3D coordinates containing directional information. Materials and methods: Bicortical screw fixation was performed using either a bioabsorbable screw (25 patients) or a titanium screw (5 patients) in orthognathic surgery. Pre- and post-operative CT images (6 months after surgery) were superimposed digitally. A 3D coordinate (X, Y, Z) and vectors were employed to quantify spatial changes of the condyle and analysed statistically. Results: Measuring on 3D image showed stable error about 0.16 mm. There were no significant differences in the total spatial changes of the condyle between titanium and bioabsorbable screws with the exception of the lateral-medial direction of the condylar centre (P = 0.042). The directional vector components were stable, regardless of mandibular setback. Conclusion: In 3D vector analysis, bioabsorbable screw fixation in SSRO with distal segment osteotomy shows clinically acceptable postoperative condylar position stability.

This silver cluster-assembled material serves as a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the cyclization of both terminal and internal propargylamines with CO(2)under atmospheric pressure. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrate that the high catalytic activity and broad substrate scope are attributable to the saddle-shaped metallic node inAg27-MOF, which features an accessible platform with high-density silver atoms as pi-Lewis acid sites for activating C equivalent to C triple bonds. As a result, different sterically hindered alkyne substrates can be effectively activated through pi-interactions with these cationic silver centers.

A method for visualizing surface-exposed and internal PfEMP1 adhesion antigens in <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> infected erythrocytes	MALARIA JOURNAL			English	Article							PROTEIN TRAFFICKING; MALARIA; CELLS; MEMBRANE; EXTRACTION; FIXATION; BINDING; VAR2CSA	Background: The insertion of parasite antigens into the host erythrocyte membrane and the structure and distribution of Plasmodium falciparum adhesion receptors on that membrane are poorly understood. Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and a novel labelling and fixation method have been used to obtain high resolution immuno-fluorescent images of erythrocyte surface PfEMP1 and internal antigens which allow analysis of the accumulation of PfEMP1 on the erythrocyte membrane during asexual development. Methods: A novel staining technique has been developed which permits distinction between erythrocyte surface PfEMP1 and intracellular PfEMP1, in parasites whose nuclear material is exceptionally well resolved. Primary antibody detection by fluorescence is carried out on the live parasitized erythrocyte. The surface labelled cells are then fixed using paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with a non-ionic detergent to permit access of antibodies to internal parasite antigens. Differentiation between surface and internal antigens is achieved using antibodies labelled with different fluorochromes and confocal microscopy Results: Surface exposed PfEMP1 is first detectable by antibodies at the trophozoite stage of intracellular parasite development although the improved detection method indicates that there are differences between different laboratory isolates in the kinetics of accumulation of surface-exposed PfEMP1. Conclusion: A sensitive method for labelling surface and internal PfEMP1 with up to three different fluorochromes has been developed for laser scanning confocal optical microscopy and the analysis of the developmental expression of malaria adhesion antigens.

In this work, chitosan/hydroxyapatite composite rods with multilayer structure were reinforced using a bio-crosslinker to improve their mechanical properties and anti-degradation ability. The SEM results revealed that the composite rods had a tree-ring structure. The bending strength and bending modulus of the crosslinked rods could arrive at 161 MPa and 7.2 GPa, respectively, increased by 59.4% and 26.3% compared with uncrosslinked ones (p < 0.05). The enzymatic degradation studies indicated that genipin crosslinking could effectively enhance the biostability of the composite rods. Consequently, genipin-crosslinked chitosan/hydroxyapatite composite rods with excellent mechanical properties would be a novel device used for internal fixation of bone fracture.

The materials currently being used in device or research (silicon, polymer, platinum) do not support neuronal attachment on their surfaces. Here, we investigated primary neuronal cell attachment on Pyrex glass, sapphire, and iridium oxide as promising alternative materials. Sapphire was found to be an excellent substrate to support neuron attachment in serum free condition. Using micro-patterning, sapphire was shown to have great potential as a substrate for next generation neural implants. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Comparison of Two Fixation Methods for Arthrodesis of the Calcaneocuboid Joint: A Biomechanical Study	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						calcaneocuboid joint; lag screw; locking compression plate; surgical fixation; triple arthrodesis	TRIPLE ARTHRODESIS; INTERNAL-FIXATION; ADULTS; SCREW	Background: The traditional fixation for a calcaneocuboid (CC) arthrodesis in triple arthrodesis is with a 6.5-mm cancellous screw. This procedure can be technically challenging. Fixation with a locking compression plate (LCP) may be easier to perform while achieving compression perpendicular to the fusion site. The purpose of this study was to compare the load to failure and the stiffness for each fixation method. Methods: Five matched-pair cadaver feet had an arthrodesis of the CC joint. For each matched pair, one was fixed with a screw and the other with an LCP. Surface bead markers were applied. Each specimen was then secured to a material testing machine through the calcaneus. The plantar surface of the cuboid faced the hydraulic ram to simulate weightbearing. A force was applied while the specimen was recorded with a high-resolution camera. The endpoint was maximal force at 2-mm separation between the calcaneus and cuboid measured along a horizontal axis. Results: The average force to failure and the average stiffness in the screw group were significantly less than the LCP group (P < .05). The screw construct failed in pullout from the cuboid; the LCP construct failed by plastic deformation of the plate. Conclusion: Calcaneocuboid joint fixation with the LCP withstood a higher load until failure and demonstrated greater stiffness than with a 6.5-mm cancellous lag screw.

MATERIAL and METHODS: In this technique; instrumentation was started following the decompression with insertion of screws into lateral masses. At the occipital level, two symmetrical burr holes were drilled and two occipital bone hooks were inserted into each burr hole with an inverted position with respect to each other. Afterwards, rod-plates were placed and locked on the hooks and screw heads. Bone grafting was also performed to achieve a solid fusion. RESULTS: There were no neurological or vascular complications associated with this technique. No infection-related complications or hematomas were observed. Cerebro-spinal fluid leaks (CSF) occurred when the burr holes were drilled in 4 patients; however, these ceased when the occipital bone hooks were inserted. There were no cases of postoperative CSF fistula or pseudo-meningocele formation. No instrumentation problem was noted in any of the cases during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Relatively long term (average 30.44 months) evaluation of the technique in terms of stability is satisfactory with no neurological, vascular or other major complications. However, further biomechanical studies are needed.

A frequent difficulty is the precise three dimensional (3D) alignment of the distracted midface and the proper fixation of the distraction device in the midfacial area. In this study we present an individual modification method for commercial distraction devices comprising the establishment of prefabricated fixation plates and parallel connecting pins. Material: Individual prefabricated fixation plates for the zygomatic buttress were combined with two commercial distraction devices. Method: The fixation plates were made by a casting technique using individual cranial models as templates. The latter were fabricated by the rapid prototyping technique of 3D powder printing. For precise realization of the distraction vector, two commercial devices were combined and attached rigidly to the fixation plates by two parallel pins. Result: In the clinical routine, the 3D powder printing technique enables the simple fabrication of precise individual cranial models, which are required for manufacturing individual fixation plates. The combination of two commercial distraction devices facilitates the appropriate transfer of complex distraction vectors into the midfacial area. Conclusion: The technique presented should be useful for a precise multi-directional midfacial distraction following Le Fort III osteotomy.

A hundred cases prospective study	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Trochanteric fracture; Morbidity; Mortality; Internal fixation	COMPRESSION HIP-SCREW; GAMMA-NAIL; FEMORAL FRACTURES; INTERTROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; LIFE EXPECTANCY; PROXIMAL FEMUR; PLATE; FIXATION; MULTICENTER; FALLS	Background: Trochanteric fractures are a major source of mortality, morbidity and functional impairment in the elderly. Morbidity is closely related to the degree of instability and comminution and is substantially influenced by the quality of reduction and internal fixation. Advanced age and associated co-morbidities are two decisive factors of mortality secondary to trochanteric fracture. Objectives: This prospective study examined the epidemiological profile of trochanteric fractures and assessed mortality and morbidity with the aim of establishing management guidelines and improving prevention strategies. Material and methods: One hundred patients were included; 60% were male. Mean age was 76 years (range, 60-96 yrs). One, or more than one, co-morbidities were present in 68% of cases. The fractures were caused by a simple fall in 90% of cases. Fractures were classified according to the criteria of Ramadier and the ones of Ender. Sixty-five percent of these fractures were unstable. A dynamic hip screw was systematically used as the standard means of internal fixation. Results: Anatomic and functional results were analyzed in 82 patients (18 had died within the first year following fracture occurrence). Mean follow-up period was 24 months (range, 12-36 months). Bone healing was achieved in 96% of cases. There were numerous postoperative complications (four cases of thromboembolism, fourteen immobility-related complications, two infections, six secondary displacement combined to loss of fixation, four non-unions, and nine malunions). At 2 years follow-up, 28 patients had died. Mortality was strongly correlated with older age (over 90 years), associated co-morbidity and fracture instability. Good functional outcomes (72%) correlated with younger age (60-74 years), fracture stability, adequate reduction and internal fixation. Discussion: In stable trochanteric fractures, osteosynthesis by dynamic screw-plate is more effective than alternative techniques (blade-plate, nail-plate, Ender nail or even trochantericnail). In unstable trochanteric fractures, delayed weight-bearing should be prefered to avoid mechanical complications. In fractures that are unstable or extend far below the lesser trochanter, trochanteric nailing is indicated since providing enhanced stability, but sometimes at the cost of insufficient reduction. The treatment objective should be the complete resumption of weight-bearing as early as possible with the fewest possible complications. Prevention consists in detecting and treating osteoporosis and countering the causes of falls in elderly subjects (muscular reinforcement and correction of neurosensory deficit). Level of evidence: Level III: Prospective diagnostic study. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Percutaneous iliosacral screw fixation in unstable pelvic ring lesions: The interest of O-ARM CT-guided navigation	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Iliosacral screw fixation; CT-guided navigation; Pelvic ring	INTERNAL-FIXATION; REDUCTION; FRACTURES	Introduction: The reference surgical treatment for unstable posterior pelvic fracture is percutaneous iliosacral screw fixation, isolated or in association with other techniques. As there is a risk of passage outside the bone when performing screw fixation under fluoroscopy, new image-guidance techniques have been developed: fluoronavigation, peroperative 3D navigation, CT-linked navigation, etc. Since September 2011, our department has performed iliosacral screw fixation under CT control linked to navigation so as to optimize screw positioning. This innovative technology has been used in neurosurgery in our center since 2007, for disc implants, spinal fracture, vertebral arthrodesis and intracerebral localization. Material and methods: Six patients were treated by iliosacral screw fixation for posterior pelvic ring fracture lesion. The O-ARM (Medtronic (R)) computer-assisted surgical navigation system was used, combining surgical navigation and peroperative 3D imaging. This kind of osteosynthesis is suitable for non-displaced or prereduced fracture. A radiation dose report is drawn up at end of surgery. Discussion: Postoperative course does not differ from other percutaneous osteosynthesis techniques, combing the advantages of a percutaneous approach (reduced infection and blood-loss rates, etc.) while optimizing iliosacral screw positioning. To date, no radiation overexposure has been found. Conclusion: The precision and safety of iliosacral screw fixation are now unequalled, meeting the basic computer-assisted surgery principles of reduced morbidity without overexposure to ionizing radiation. Indications for computer-assisted surgery should therefore be extended to iliosacral pathologies (arthritic, tumoral and inflammatory), non-displaced acetabular fracture, etc. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Materials and methods: In total, 15 patients were included in group 1, in which open reduction and internal fixation using volar locking plates were performed, whereas 15 patients were included in group 2, in which closed reduction and percutaneous K-wire fixation were utilized. In both groups, the functional outcomes were evaluated according to the Gartland-Werley scoring system. The Knirk and Jupiter scoring system was used to classify arthritic changes. Stewart's radiological assessment criteria were used in angular assessments. Grip strength measurement was performed. Results: At the end of the follow-up, a significant difference was detected between the groups in volar tilt value (P<0.05) but not in radial inclination and radial length (P>0.05). Significant differences were detected in the Gartland-Werley score and the mean Knirk and Jupiter score between the two groups (P<0.05). No significant difference was found in the mean Stewart score between the groups (P>0.05). Conclusion: It was concluded that K-wire fixation seems insufficient in distal radius fractures of the complex intra-articular type.

Materials and methods: SSRO was performed to 48 sheep hemimandibles in eight groups of 6 each. Group A- a four hole standard miniplate; Group B- a four hole standard miniplate and one bicortical screw; Group C-a four hole locking plate; Group D-a four hole locking plate and one bicortical screw; Group E-a six hole straight miniplate; Group F-a six hole straight miniplate and one bicortical screw; Group G- a sliding plate, which was specifically designed for SSRO; Group H- sliding plate and one bicortical screw. Results: In terms of measured values of displacement, the highest degrees of displacement were observed in decreasing order in Groups G, C, A, and E. The least displacement values were detected in Groups H, F, D and B with values being very close to each other. For linear force applied up to 70N, 3 mm or higher displacement values were not seen in any fixation system. Conclusion: According to the results of study, all systems are suitable for clinic usage. However, intermaxillary fixation or functional elastics may be needed for sliding plate systems during the healing period of hard tissue.

Design: Biomechanical laboratory study in synthetic bone test medium. Methods: Narrow 4.5-mm stainless steel low-contoured dynamic compression plates were anchored with cortical screws to blocks of polyurethane foam. The fixation strength in cantilever bending (gap closing mode) and torsion was quantified using a material testing system. Different constructs were tested to investigate the effect of the screw orientation at the end of the plate (straight versus oblique at 30degrees) the plate, and bridging length as well as the number of screws. Results: An oblique screw at the plate end produced an increased strength of fixation in all tests; however, the difference was more significant in shorter plates and in constructs with no screw omission adjacent to the fracture site. Both longer plates and increased bridging length produced a significantly stronger Construct able to withstand higher compression loads. Under torsional loading, the fixation strength was mainly dependent oil the number of screws. Conclusions: The Current data suggest that when using a conventional plating technique, plate length is the most important factor ill withstanding forces in cantilever bending. With regard to resisting torsional load, the number of screws is the most important factor. Furthermore, oblique screws at the ends of a plate increase fixation strength.

J	Bhuyan, BK				Bhuyan, Basant Kumar			Augmented osteosynthesis with tensor fascia latae muscle pedicle bone grafting in neglected femoral neck fracture	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Neglected femoral neck fracture; osteosynthesis; tensor fascia latae muscle pedicle bone grafting	INTERNAL-FIXATION; SUBCAPITAL FRACTURES; YOUNG-ADULTS; HEAD; OSTEONECROSIS; MANAGEMENT; REDUCTION; HIP	Background: Neglected intracapsular femoral neck fracture in young patients may fail to unite because of the excessive shearing strain at the fracture site and it is a surgical challenge to any orthopedic surgeon. The problem is compounded by resorption of the femoral neck and avascular necrosis (AVN) of femoral head. There is no satisfactory solution available in the management of femoral neck fracture as far as the union of the fracture and AVN of femoral head are concerned. Muscle pedicle bone grafting has been advocated to provide additional blood supply to the femoral head. We report a retrospective analysis of 48 cases of neglected femoral neck fracture treated by internal fixation and tensor fascia latae based muscle pedicle bone grafting. Materials and Methods: 48 patients with femoral neck fractures with age varied from 20 to 53 years (average age 32.9 years) with male to female ratio of 2:1 were enrolled. All fractures were more than 3 weeks old with mean delay being 86 days (22-150 days). Open reduction and internal fixation along with tensor fascia latae muscle pedicle bone grafting was done in all cases. It was supplemented by multiple drilling and cortico-cancellous bone grafting. Fracture fixation was done with three parallel 6.5-mm AO cannulated cancellous lag screws and the graft fixed with a 4-mm cancellous screw to provide a secure fixation. During the followup period of 2-6.8 years (average 4.4 years) the results were assessed clinically by modified Harris hip scoring system and radiologically by the evidence of signs of fracture union. Results: Union was achieved in 41/48 (85.41) cases which were followed for an average period of 4.4 years (2-6.8 years) with good functional results and ability to squat and sit cross-legged. Results were assessed according to modified Harris Hip Scoring system and found to be excellent in 19, good in 22, fair in 5, and poor in 2 patients. Complications were nonunion, (n=3) avascular necrosis (n=2), and coxa vara deformity (n=2). Conclusion: Internal fixation with muscle pedicle bone grafting is a suitable option to secure union in neglected femoral neck fractures in physiologically active patients with late presentation.

J	Redfern, DJ; Oliveira, MLR; Campbell, JT; Belkoff, SM				Redfern, DJ; Oliveira, MLR; Campbell, JT; Belkoff, SM			A biomechanical comparison of locking and nonlocking plates for the fixation of calcaneal fractures	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						calcaneus; fracture fixation; locking plate; osteoporosis	DISPLACED INTRAARTICULAR FRACTURES; PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OS CALCIS; NONOPERATIVE TREATMENT; OPERATIVE TREATMENT; OPEN REDUCTION; MANAGEMENT; STRENGTH; MOTION	Background: Locking plate systems have been developed in an attempt to increase the strength of fracture fixation and, in so doing, allow earlier mobilization and rehabilitation. The purpose of our study was to compare the mechanical integrity of the locking plate and traditional nonlocking plate fixation for calcaneal fractures in a cadaver model. Our hypothesis was that the locking plate construct provides stronger fixation than the nonlocking plate construct. Methods: We created a Sanders type-IIB fracture in 10 pairs of fresh-frozen cadaver feet (bone mineral density, 0.50 +/- 0.14 g/cm(2); age, 69 +/- 16 years). One foot of each pair was fixed with a nonlocking calcaneal plate (Synthes, Paoli, PA), and the contralateral foot was fixed with the Locking Calcaneal Plate (Synthes, Paoli, PA). The specimens then were cyclically loaded through the tibia from 0 to 700 N at 1 Hz on a materials testing machine to simulate weightbearing. Fragment displacement was measured with a three-dimensional kinematic analysis system. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: There was no significant difference between the two plating systems with respect to the mean (+/- SD) number of cycles to failure (locking plate, 3261 +/- 2355; nonlocking plate, 2271 +/- 2465). Conclusion: In a cadaver model of type-IIB calcaneal fractures, locking plate fixation did not provide a biomechanical advantage over traditional nonlocking plate fixation.

Materials and methods: We designed a novel intramedullary anatomical medial strut with allograft bone (IAMSAB) using MIMICS software to specifically fill the intramedullary canal of the proximal humeral bone. We used finite element analysis to evaluate the biomechanical characteristics of a LLP, LLP-intramedullary fixation system (IFS), LLP-anatomical medial locking plate (AMLP), or the combined application of a LLP and IAMSAB (LLP-IAMSAB) fixation construct in patients with a PHF and an unstable medial column. Results: For axial or rotational loads, under (normal) Nor or osteoporotic (Ost) bone conditions, the LLP-IAMSAB fixation construct was significantly stiffer than the LLP-IFS fixation construct, and displacement at the fracture site after LLP-IAMSAB fixation was significantly less than after LLP or LLP-IFS fixation (P < 0.05). Stiffness of the LLP-IAMSAB and LLP-AMLP fixation constructs and displacement at the fracture site after LLP-IAMSAB and LLP-AMLP fixation were not significantly different. The IFS, AMLP, and IAMSAB shared the load in the LLP and decreased the risk of implant failure. There were no significant differences in von Mises stress and stress distribution after fixation with the LLP-IFS, LLP-AMLP, and LLP-IAMSAB constructs. Conclusion: These data suggest that the IAMSAB can provide direct medial support or resistance to rotation and augment the biomechanics of the LLP. The combined application of the IAMSAB and LLP may achieve functional outcomes that are similar to the LLP-AMLP fixation construct.

J	Lai, BR; Liao, HT				Lai, Bo-Ru; Liao, Han-Tsung			The Comparison of Functional Outcomes in Patients With Unilateral or Bilateral Intracapsular Mandibular Condylar Fractures After Closed or Open Treatment A 10-Year Retrospective Study	ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY			English	Article						condylar head fracture; closed reduction; open reduction and internal fixation; intracapsular condylar fractures	HEAD FRACTURES; OPEN REDUCTION; NONSURGICAL TREATMENT; INTERNAL-FIXATION; CLASSIFICATION; METAANALYSIS; MULTICENTER; MANAGEMENT; PATTERN; TRISMUS	BackgroundThe treatment strategies for mandibular condylar head fractures, also known as intracapsular condylar fractures (ICFs), have not been concluded. We humbly present our treatment outcomes and share our experience in our department.Aims and ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to compare the functional outcomes between closed reduction (CR) and open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for management of unilateral or bilateral ICFs.Materials and MethodsThis 10-year retrospective cohort study included 71 patients with 102 ICFs who were treated in our department from May 2007 to August 2017. Nine patients mixed with extracapsular fractures were excluded; thus, 62 patients with 93 ICFs were included. All patients received treatment by the senior surgeon in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou Branch, Taiwan. The patient's basic data, fracture morphologies, associated injuries, managements, complications, and maximal mouth opening (MMO) measurement at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperative were reviewed for analysis.ResultsAmong the 93 fractures, 31 (50%) were bilateral and 31 were unilateral (50%). Based on He ' s classification, 45 (48%) had type A fracture, 13 (14%) had type B, 5 (5%) had type C, 20 (22%) had type M, and 10 (11%) had no displacement. Maximal mouth opening of 37 mm in unilateral cases after 6 months was significantly higher than the 33-mm MMO in bilateral cases. In addition, the MMO in the ORIF group was significantly higher than that of the CR group in 3 months postoperative. Univariate (odds ratio, 4.92; P = 0.01) and multivariate (odds ratio, 4.76; P = 0.027) analyses revealed CR as an independent risk factor for trismus development compared with ORIF. Malocclusion was observed in 5 patients in both CR and ORIF groups. In addition, 1 patient developed temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis in the CR group. No surgical-related temporary or permanent facial nerve palsy was observed.ConclusionsOpen reduction and internal fixation for condylar head fracture provided better recovery in MMO than CR, and the MMO recovery was less in bilateral condylar head fracture than unilateral condylar head fracture. Open reduction and internal fixation in ICFs have a lower risk for trismus development and should be the treatment of choice in selected cases.

The horizontal rod-rod crosslink (hR-R CL) is often used to enhance segmental posterior instrumentation. However, the biomechanics of the alternative horizontal screw-screw crosslink (hS-S CL) in the craniocervical junction are unclear. Material/Methods: A nonlinear atlantoaxial instability 3-dimensional C1-C2 finite element model was constructed using computed tomography images. On this basis, 2 fixation models were established with C1-C2 PSR fixation using (1) a rod-rod crosslink (R-R CL), and (2) a screw-screw crosslink (S-S CL). Range of motion (ROM) of the atlantoaxial joint, stress distribution of the implants, and maximum stress value of the vertebral bodies were calculated and compared under 4 loading conditions, including flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation. Results: Atlantoaxial joint ROM was reduced by 90.19% to 98.5% with the hR-R CL, and by 90.1% to 98.7% with the hS-S CL, compared with the instability model. During axial rotation, the total stress peak of the PSR fixation was smaller with hS-S CL than with hR-R CL. The peak stress values of the vertebral bodies were comparable between the 2 fixation models. Conclusions: The 2 tested crosslink models provided comparable stability. However, during axial rotation, the total stress peak of hS-S CL fixation was smaller than that of hR-R CL fixation. Since the atlantoaxial joint primarily functions as a rotational joint, our results suggested that the use of hS-S CL can provide a more stable environment for the implants.

Impact of screw thread shape on stress transfer in bone: a finite element study	COMPUTER METHODS IN BIOMECHANICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Magnesium; finite element analysis; stress concentration	PULLOUT STRENGTH; MINERAL DENSITY; MAGNESIUM; PREDICTION; RESORPTION; FIXATION; IMPLANTS	Gradual screw loosening is a well-known failure mechanism in internal fixation. Loosening is primarily due to progressive bone loss caused by stress shielding, a phenomenon in which a medical device absorbs a disproportionate amount of load within the screw-bone construct. The proximity of elastic moduli of magnesium and bone presents the potential for alleviating screw loosening by allowing optimum stress to be transferred between screw and bone, and in turn, supporting bone remodeling around the screw. In this study, the effect of thread profile on stress transfer in a magnesium fixation was simulated using a 2-D finite element model. Modified stress parameters from a previous study were used to estimate stress transfer across three thread profiles. Results showed highest stress transfer in trapezoidal-shaped magnesium screw thread. In accordance, this study corroborates the potential for magnesium as an ultimate screw material to eliminate progressive screw loosening.

MATERIAL and METHODS: A three-dimensional, non-linear finite element analysis (FEA) model of T8 through T9 was used. Anatomic trajectory (AT) and Straightforward trajectory (ST) models of the transpedicular screws were used in the intact FEA model. The von-Mises stress and range of motion (ROM) of the transpedicular screws were evaluated. RESULTS: The difference in ROM between both techniques was negligible. In lateral bending and axial rotation, FEA showed decrease in stress by 25% and 8%, respectively, when pedicle screws were placed using AT. CONCLUSION: AT decreased the von-Mises stress of the pedicle screws, thereby reducing the rates of screw breakage and fatigue risks. In addition, we believe that AT could protect against screw loosening because the von-Mises stress of the internal fixation was scattered.

However, open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) utilizing locking compression plate (LCP) might be an effective treatment with a reduced surgical time and less complex procedure in a typically elderly patient collective with multiple comorbidities. The purpose of this study was to compare the functional and radiographic outcomes in two cohorts with Vancouver B2 periprosthetic femoral fractures after primary THA, treated either by ORIF with LCP fixation, or by revision arthroplasty utilizing a non-cemented long femoral stem. Materials and Methods: 36 patients with Vancouver B2 periprosthetic femoral fractures following THA, who had been treated between 2000 and 2014, were reviewed. Eight fractures were treated with LCP fixation, fourteen fractures with the first-generation revision prosthesis (Helios1), and fourteen fractures with the second-generation revision prosthesis (HyperionTM). The patients were assessed clinically with the Parker mobility score and radiographically. Results: A total of ten males and 26 females formed the basis of this report with an average age of 81years (range, 64 to 96 years). All fractures treated with LCP fixation alone healed uneventfully and there were no signs of secondary stem migration, malalignement or plate breakage. The average surgical time was shorter in the ORIF cohort; however, the results were not statistically significant. The postoperative Parker mobility score at latest follow-up showed no difference between the groups. Conclusions: According to the results of the current study, we conclude that the use of LCP fixation can be a sufficient option for the treatment of Vancouver B2 periprosthetic femoral fractures correspondingly with femoral stem loosening.

Type 4 capitellum fractures: Diagnosis and treatment strategies	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Capitellum fracture; type 4 capitellum fracture; bone fixation; bone screw	INTERNAL-FIXATION; CAPITULUM HUMERI; RADIAL HEAD; ADOLESCENTS; REDUCTION; TROCHLEA	Background: Fractures of the capitellum are rare injuries of the elbow usually seen in the adolescents. This fracture is often missed in the emergency room if a proper radiograph is not available. Recent reports have described many modalities of treatment favoring headless screw for fixation. The facility for headless screw fixation, however, is not available in most centers. This paper presents the diagnosis and management of type 4 capituller fractures (Mckee) with gadgets available in a district hospital. Materials and Methods: Between 2004 and 2007 three patients with right sided type IV capetullar fracture were treated in a district hospital. There were two boys aged 15 and 17 and one 33 years old lady. In one case, the fracture was missed in the emergency room. A double arc sign in the lateral views of the X-rays of the elbow was seen in all the cases. In each case a preoperative CT scan was done and a diagnosis of Mckee type IV fracture of the capitellum was made. Under tourniquet, using extended lateral approach, open reduction and internal fixation was done using 4mm partially threaded AO cancellous screws (n=2) and 2.7 mm AO screws (n=1), under vision from posterior to anterior direction from the posterior aspect of lateral condyle of humerus avoiding articular penetration. Results: All the fractures united uneventfully. At the end of one year follow-up, two cases had excellent elbow function; implants were removed and there were no signs of AVN or arthritis. The third case had good elbow ROM at 11 months without AVN. Conclusion: Double arc sign on lateral X-rays of the elbow along with pre-operative CT scan evaluation is important to avoid a missed diagnosis and analysis of type IV capitellur fracture. Fixation with non-cannulated ordinary AO screws using extended Kochers lateral approach has given good results.	[Suresh, S.

The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficiency of biodegradable self-reinforced (SR-PLDLA) bone plates and screws in open reduction and internal fixation of mandible fractures in children. Study design. Thirteen patients (5 female, 8 male; mean age 12 years, range 5-16 years) were operated on various fractures of the mandible (2 symphyseal, 6 parasymphyseal, 4 body, 3 angle, I ramus, 2 condylar fractures). The mean follow-up time was 26.4 months (range 10.9-43.4 months). intermaxillary fixation was applied in cases with concomitant condylar fractures up to 3 weeks. Results. Primary healing of the fractured mandible was observed in all patients. Postoperative complications were minor and transient. The outcome of the operations was not endangered. Adverse tissue reactions to the implants, malocclusion, and growth restrictions did not occur during the observation period. Conclusions. Pediatric patients benefit from the advantages of resorbable materials, especially from faster mobilization and the avoidance of secondary removal operations. Based on these preliminary results, self-reinforced fixation devices are safe and efficient in the treatment of pediatric mandible fractures. However, further clinical investigations are necessary to evaluate the long-term reliability.

Titanium is considered a fully compatible material. However, reports of allergic reactions to titanium implants do occur. The aim of this work is to answer the question whether titanium devices used in the treatment of fractures in the craniofacial region can cause allergic reactions. The study comprised 50 subjects treated surgically for maxillofacial injuries with the use of titanium composite devices. Allergic tests were performed by the patch method. The control group consisted of 20 healthy people who did not have any titanium elements. There were no skin changes to titanium and its compounds in both the test and control groups. Only one patient had a positive skin test which showed an allergic reaction to silver nitrate. Titanium fixing elements, as well as titanium dental implants, according to our research, do not show allergic skin reactions.

A 309 case series	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Proximal femoral metastasis; Pathological fracture; Total hip arthroplasty; Trochanterocephalic locking nail	PATHOLOGICAL FRACTURES; BONE METASTASIS; PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; SCORING SYSTEM; FEMUR; DISEASE; SURVIVAL; HEMIARTHROPLASTY; COMPLICATIONS; LESIONS	Introduction: The proximal femur is the most frequent operative site for metastasis, but there is no consensus between internal fixation and hip replacement. The present multicenter retrospective observational study sought: (1) to compare early clinical results between internal fixation and hip replacement for proximal femoral metastasis (PFM), and ( 2) to assess events affecting survival. Hypothesis: The study hypothesis was that internal fixation and hip replacement give comparable clinical results, operative site complications rates and survival. Material and methods: The series comprised 309 cases, 10 of which were bilateral, in 182 females and 117 males, with a mean age of 67.2 +/- 11.5 years and 62.5 +/- 13.2 years, respectively. Primaries were mainly breast (118; 38.2%), lung (85; 25.5%) or kidney (40; 12.9%). PFM was revelatory in 114 cases (36.9%). There was visceral involvement in 142 patients (46%), multiple peripheral bone involvement in 212 (68.6%), and spinal involvement in 134 (43.4%). There were 124 pathologic fractures (40%), 51 of which were revelatory. Metastases were cervicocephalic in 135 cases (43.7%), metaphyseal in 166 (53.7%) and both in 8 (2.6%). PFM was osteolytic in 90% of cases, managed by hip replacement in 161 cases and internal fixation in 148 (12 screwed plates, 136 nails). Seventy-seven patients had postoperative radiation therapy. Results: After hip replacement (n = 144), walking was normal in 35 cases (24.3%), impaired but unassisted in 53 (36.8%), with 1 forearm crutch in 24 (16.6%), 2 crutches or a frame in 26 (18%), and impossible in 6 (4.1%). After nailing (n = 125), results were respectively 38 (30.4%), 47 (37.6%), 15 (12%), 18 (14.4) and 7 (5.6%). Recovery of normal walking capacity did not significantly differ according to technique (p = 0.162); nor did pain or function. Recovery of normal walking capacity was better after preventive surgery (p < 0.001). Perioperative complications comprised: 10 cases of severe blood loss, 7 pulmonary embolisms, 6 digestive hemorrhages, and 5 lung infections. Secondarily, there were 11 infections (7 after hip replacement, 2 after nailing, 2 after plate fixation), 7 progressive osteolyses and 5 fractures. Complications rates were significantly higher with plate fixation, with no difference between nailing and hip replacement. Survival did not significantly differ between hip replacement (12 months [95% CI: 7-19]), nailing (7 months [95% CI: 6-11 ]) and plate fixation (16 months [95% CI: 6-not calculable]). Conclusions: Clinical results and survival were comparable between hip replacement and nailing, confirming the study hypothesis, in agreement with the literature. Each technique has its indications. Patients with severely impaired walking capacity benefited greatly from surgery. The importance of preventive surgery was highlighted. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Surgical exposure of those sites needed to allow for accurate reduction and for rigid fixation has a high possibility of negative consequences. The objective of the present study was to present a singleincision, single-fixation site zygoma fracture repair technique using a single zygoma c-arm view to quantitatively determine its accuracy, complication rate, and practical aspects in a clinical series. Materials and Methods: In a prospective study, consecutive patients with isolated, unilateral, displaced zygoma fractures not requiring orbital floor exploration treated using a c-arm-assisted repair technique at the author's institution from 2009 to 2011 were included. Objective outcomes assessed included accuracy of zygoma realignment (on postoperative computed tomogram), ocular globe projection symmetry (using a Naugle exophthalmometer), complication rate, and operative duration. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student t test. Results: Twenty patients were included. Differences in zygoma projection, width, and height between the uninjured and repaired sides of the face were clinically noteworthy (>3 mm) in the first patient only. Average differences of these parameters for all 20 patients were clinically and statistically insignificant. Differences in ocular globe projection between the uninjured and repaired sides of the face for each patient were no greater than 2 mm. The average difference in globe projection for all 20 patients was also clinically and statistically insignificant. No major complications occurred, and the average operative duration was 76 minutes. Conclusions: The present study shows that the c-arm-assisted zygoma fracture repair technique is accurate, has a low complication rate, can be performed quickly, and has a relatively low level of difficulty.

Methods: Between April 2016 and March 2018, five patients required anterior maxillary alveolar ridge augmentation using fixation with u-HA/PLLA screws for an onlay block bone graft harvested from the mandibular ramus at our institute. Bone biopsies were obtained from the dental implantation site following bone healing for histomorphometric and immunohistochemical (IHC) measurements. Results: Many stromal cells were positive for Osterix, RUNX2, and SOX9 but were negative for CD68. On cell counting, based on IHC staining for Osterix, RUNX2, SOX9 and CD68 from peripheral u-HA/PLLA screw or bone areas, both areas consistently showed no significant difference in terms of Osterix, RUNX2, and SOX9. Hematoxylin-eosin staining revealed direct bone connection to the biomaterials, and no inflammatory cells infiltrated the areas surrounding the bone or artificial material. Area between the bone and u-HA/PLLA screw was seamless with no boundary. Round small cells and immature fibroblasts were noted. The new bone showed the presence of bone lamellae, normal osteocytes, and osteoblasts. Conclusion: The u-HA/PLLA materials showed excellent biodegradability and bioactive osteoconductivity. In addition, this material induced no apparent inflammatory or foreign body reactions following implantation, and it directly bonded to the human bone. Therefore, this u-HA/PLLA material seems ideal and most suitable for use as a substitute for osteosynthesis.

Volar fixation for dorsally angulated extra-articular fractures of the distal radius: A biomechanical study	JOURNAL OF HAND SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME			English	Article						biomechanics; distal radius fracture; internal fixation; plate	INTERNAL-FIXATION; PI PLATE; COMPRESSION; MULTICENTER	Purpose: To compare the biomechanical properties of 10 volar plate-fixation designs in 2 fracture models (dorsal wedge osteotomy, segmental resection osteotomy models). Methods: Forty-eight radiuses were used in this study including 8 pairs. In 40 specimens a 15-mm dorsally based wedge osteotomy was performed and the volar cortex was fractured manually. They were arranged into 10 fixation groups with 5 different fixation designs (test 1). In the contralateral specimens of 8 paired radiuses a 10-mm segment of bone was excised (test 2). Four of the 10 fixation systems were chosen for these specimens. Cadaver hands and the proximal radiuses were potted in polymethylmethacrylate and tested with a servohydraulic materials testing machine with 300 N of axial compression load at 1 N/s initially and after each 1,000 cycles up to 5,000 cycles. After cyclic loading the specimens were loaded to failure in axial compression at 2 mm/min. The stiffness, failure peak load, and failure mode of each specimen were recorded. Results: In test 1 in the wedge osteotomy specimens the T plate was the stiffest and the Synthes titanium plate was the least stiff; however, all specimens completed the 5,000 cycles of loading with no failures. There was no significant difference between the 10 fixation groups in failure peak load and only 7 of 40 failed at the distal portion of the hardware in the final load to failure testing. In test 2 the resection osteotomy specimens were less stiff and failed at a lower failure peak load compared with the wedge osteotomy specimens. Failure at the distal portion of the fixation system was seen in 7 of 8 specimens; nonlocking screws loosened and tines compressed the surrounding bone, resulting in tine-hole enlargement. Conclusions: All of the plate-fixation systems delivered sufficient stability to permit the simulated postoperative regimen of I week of immobilization followed by 5 weeks of early mobilization until expected union at 6 weeks after surgery. Based on these results a preferable volar fixation system would appear to benefit from the following: (1) sufficient plate strength to support the distal fragment from the volar side, (2) a locking system with sufficient strength to remain locked during the healing process, and (3) a distal design that does not affect the bone adversely. The anatomic reduction of the volar cortex in the wedge osteotomy specimens added stability to the construct.

The objective of this multicentre study was to assess the reduction and fixation of unicondylar fractures. Hypothesis: Anatomic reduction followed by strong fixation allows early rehabilitation therapy and provides good long-term outcomes. Material and methods: We studied 163 fractures included in two multicentre studies, of which one was retrospective (n=134) and the other prospective (n= 29). Follow-up of at least 1 year was required for inclusion. The treatment was at the discretion of the surgeon. Outcome measures were the clinical results assessed using the International Knee Society (MS) scores and presence after fracture healing of malunion with angulation, an articular surface step-off, and/or tibio-femoral malalignment. Results: Mean age of the study patients was 50.9 +/- 24 years, and most patients were males with no previous history of knee disorders. The fracture was due to a high-energy trauma in 51% of cases; 17% of patients had compound fractures and 44% multiple fractures or injuries. The lateral and medial condyles were equally affected. The fracture line was sagittal in 82% of cases and coronal (Hoffa fracture) in 18% of cases. Non-operative treatment was used in 5% of cases and internal fixation in 95% of cases, with either direct screw or buttress-plate fixation for the sagittal fractures and either direct or indirect screw fixation for the coronal fractures. After treatment of the fracture, 15% of patients had articular malunion due to insufficient reduction, with either valgus-varus (10%) or flexion-recurvatum (5%) deformity; and 12% of patients had an articular step-off visible on the antero-posterior or lateral radiograph. Rehabilitation therapy was started immediately in 65% of patients. Time to full weight bearing was 90 days and time to fracture healing 120 days. Complications consisted of disassembly of the construct (2%), avascular necrosis of the condyle (2%), and arthrolysis (5%). The material was removed in 11% of patients. At last follow-up, the IKS knee score was 71 +/- 20 and the IKS function score 64 +/- 7; flexion range was 106 +/- 28 degrees (<90 degrees in 27% of patients); and 12% of patients had knee osteoarthritis. Conclusion: Anatomic reduction of unicondylar distal femoral fractures via an appropriate surgical approach, followed by stable internal fixation using either multiple large-diameter screws or a buttressplate, allows immediate mobilisation, which in turn ensures good long-term outcomes.

However, bone plate fixation on the dorsal side may result in postoperative tendon adhesion. So far, no studies have investigated the fixation of metacarpal neck fractures on the volar side by using a bone plate. The objective of this study was to investigate the differences in the fixation results between bone plate fixation on the dorsal side and bone plate fixation on the volar side of the metacarpal in the case of a metacarpal neck fracture. A saw blade was used to create a transverse metacarpal neck fracture on 14 artificial metacarpal bone specimens. The specimens were divided into 2 groups depending on the fixation method: a volar locking plate (VLP) group and a dorsal locking plate (DLP) group. All specimens were subjected to a cantilever bending test on a material testing system, and a force-displacement curve was used to measure the yield force and stiffness, which served as an indicator of the fixation ability of the 2 fracture fixation methods. For the experimental results, the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the fixation abilities of the 2 fixation methods. In terms of yield force, the DLP group (266.9 +/- 68.3 N) scored significantly higher than the VLP group (32.6 +/- 2.7 N) (P <.05); expressed in terms of median, the DLP group scored 8.2 times higher than the VLP group. Similarly, in terms of stiffness, the DLP group (69.0 +/- 13.4 N/mm, median +/- interquartile range) scored significantly higher than the VLP group (12.9 +/- 1.4 N/mm) (P <.05); expressed in terms of median, the DLP group scored 5.3 times higher than the VLP group. The fixation strength of volar bone plates is only about one-third of that of dorsal bone plates.

The most affected population are young working people. Fractures are most commonly caused by assaults and motor vehicle accidents. Its cost of care reaches 1.06 billion dollars. Premodeling osteosynthesis plates with anatomical models can decrease surgical time, bleeding, and increase patient satisfaction. This study aims to evaluate the impact of premodeled osteosynthesis plates, using anatomical models in patients with facial fractures. Material and Methods: Patients with facial fractures treated by open reduction and internal fixation were included-Group A without premolding plates and Group B with premolding. The variables studied were: age, sex, etiology of the fractures, number of fractures, among other variables that reflect the quality of the results. Results: A total of 17 osteosynthesis plates were included in 6 patients. The age was 22 to 47 years; all patients were male. The maximum surgery time was 129 to 300 minutes. The average time to start work was 4.8 weeks. When comparing the variables between the groups, we found no difference between the groups for bleeding P = 0.24, the start of work P = 0.19, the time of surgery P = 0.082, or for osteosynthesis time P = 0.15. There was only a significant difference in patient satisfaction, P = 0.04. Conclusions: The evidence collected shows that premodeling the plates only improves patients' satisfaction among facial fractures treated by open reduction and internal fixation.

The aim of the present study was to compare intraoperative radiation dose in percutaneous posterior thoracolumbar internal fixation (PPTLIF) using impedancemetry-guided pedicle sighting by the PediGuard device (SpineGuard (R)) versus gold-standard free-hand sighting. Material and methods: A single-center, single-surgeon continuous prospective randomized study was conducted from September 2017 to April 2018. Dose-area product (DAP, in cGy.cm2) was recorded at the end of pedicle sighting and end of surgery in the free-hand control group and the impedancemetry group. Pedicle screw position was studied on postoperative CT scan. Results: Sixteen patients were included in either group after 2 had been excluded. The groups were comparable for age, gender, body-mass index (BMI), indication and number of instrumented levels. Mean DPA at end of sighting and end of procedure was respectively 147.4 cGy.cm2 and 230.9 cGy.cm2 in the control group and 171.1 cGy.cm2 and 280.7 cGy.cm2 in the PediGuard group (p> 0.05). Screw positioning on CT was comparable in the 2 groups. Conclusion: In the present study, the PediGuard device did not reduce intraoperative radiation dose. The correlation between radiation dose and BMI was confirmed. Level of evidence: II; prospective randomized study.

Published studies on this topic are broad-ranging and do not distinguish between intracapsular and extracapsular fractures. This led us to conduct a retrospective analysis comparing the clinical outcomes, radiological outcomes, technical problems and complications between these two types of fractures. Hypothesis: The functional outcomes of THA after an extracapsular fracture will be worse than the ones after an intracapsular fracture. Material and methods: This was a retrospective, single-center study of 59 THA cases performed after internal fixation of a proximal femur fracture. These procedures were performed between 2002 and 2013 in 58 patients (22 men, 36 women). There were 40 intracapsular fractures and 19 extracapsular fractures. The initial fracture fixation involved a screw-plate (n=50), intramedullary nail (n=6) or screws (n=3). The mean patient age at the time of THA was 67 years [22-94]. The THA was performed an average of 2.8 years [0.2-28] after the fracture. The posterolateral approach was used in 55 cases (93%). Ten patients (17%) had the fixation hardware removed before the THA procedure, on average at 30 months [1-240] after the fracture. During the THA procedure, a cemented stem was used in 31 cases (53%) and a cementless stem in 28 cases (47%). A cementless press-fit cup was used in 56 cases (95%), of which 35 were dual mobility cups (60%), and a cemented cup was used in the other 3 cases (5%). All patients were reviewed by a physician not involved in the surgical procedures who performed a clinical and radiological examination. Results: No patients were lost to follow-up; two patients died. Ten patients suffered an intraoperative femur fracture (17%) and four suffered a dislocation (2 early, 2 late) (6.8%). Nine hips had to be reoperated (15%), of which five required an implant change (8.5%). There were significantly more intraoperative fractures and postoperative complications in the THA cases after extracapsular fracture. With a mean follow-up of 38 months [12-149], the mean PMA and Harris scores were 14.6 [3-18] and 74 [10-100], respectively; these scores were significantly lower in the THA cases after extracapsular fracture (p<0.05). With an endpoint of revision with implant change, the overall 40-month survival was 94% (95% CI: 0.25-0.55); it was 97% (95% CI: 0.62-0.85) for the intracapsular fracture cases and 84% (95% CI: 0.39-0.75) for the extracapsular fracture cases (p<0.05). Conclusion: Secondary THA after failed fixation of proximal femur fractures has more complications than primary THA. Subgroup analysis identified more technical problems in the THA cases after extracapsular fracture and a higher number of complications, particularly dislocation and periprosthetic fractures.

Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of Supracondylar Fractures of the Humerus: Revival of the Anterior Approach	JOURNAL OF NEPAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						anterior approach; open reduction; supracondylar fractures humerus		Introduction: Supracondylar fractures of the humerus occur commonly in the paediatric age group. Gartland type III fractures are treated by closed manipulation and percutaneous pinning with K-wires. Open reduction is indicated in open fractures, failed closed reductions and in a dysvascular limb. There are various approaches that can be utilized to perform an open reduction. The approach of choice must be safe, surgeon and patient friendly and should provide a good access to the fracture and the important surrounding structures. The anterior approach has been described as the most versatile approach. The aim of the study was to review the advantages and drawbacks of the anterior approach and to assess the functional outcome of fractures treated via this approach. Materials and methods: Twenty five (15 male and 10 female) patients out of a hundred and twenty eight children with Gartland type III extension variety of supracondylar fractures of the humerus from underwent open reduction and internal fixation with K-wires via an anterior approach January 2007 to January 2011. The results were assessed at six months using Flynn's radiological and clinical criteria. Results: Twenty five patients (19.53%) out of hundred and twenty eight patients underwent open reduction and internal fixation. According to Flynn's clinical and radiological criteria, 20 (80%) were found to have excellent and 5 (20%) good results. Conclusion: The anterior approach is safe, easy and provides direct exposure of the surrounding neurovascular structures with good to excellent results.	[Manandhar, R. R.; Lakhey, S.; Pandey, B.

A Biomechanical Analysis of a Tensioned Suture Device in the Fixation of the Ligamentous Lisfranc Injury	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Ligamentous Lisfranc; Midfoot Trauma; Flexible Fixation; Tightrope; Suture-button; Biomechanics	MEDIAL COLLATERAL LIGAMENT; JOINT INJURIES; SCREW FIXATION; FRACTURE-DISLOCATIONS; TARSOMETATARSAL JOINT; MECHANICAL CONDITIONS; PRIMARY ARTHRODESIS; INTERNAL-FIXATION; EXTERNAL FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION	Background: We hypothesized that using a cadaveric Lisfranc ligamentous injury model, abduction stress would provoke greater post-injury motion than axial weightbearing between the medial cuneiform (MC1) and the base of the second metatarsal (MT2). Second, we hypothesized that both a tensioned suture-button device and a rigid screw fixation method could maintain a reduction and similarly restrain motion to intact (pre-injury) levels. Materials and Methods: Motion was measured between MC1 and MT2 in five matched pairs of human cadaveric feet. Specimens were tested prior to injury, following a transverse ligamentous Lisfranc injury, and then randomized to either screw or tensioned suture-button fixation. Axial then abduction loads were applied. Measurements were repeated after one thousand loading cycles. Results: With both axial and abduction loads, statistically significant differences in motion were detected between the intact and post-injury conditions, although the magnitudes were greater with abduction (6.8 mm versus 2.0 mm, p = 0.000004). With abduction loads, both fixation methods were effective in restraining motion to pre-injury levels (screw fixation: 1.5 mm intact versus 1.1 mm post-fixation, p = 0.487; suture-button fixation: 1.3 mm intact versus 2.1 mm post-fixation, p = 0.063), and similarly, both devices restrained motion to less than post-injury levels (screw fixation: 8.1 mm post-injury versus 1.1 mm post-fixation, p = 0.001; suture-button fixation: mean 5.5 mm post-injury versus 2.1 mm post-fixation, p = 0.0002). No significant differences in these patterns were detected following cyclic loading. Conclusion: Small, though statistically significant, amounts of motion are produced between MC1 and MT2 with axial loading after a ligamentous Lisfranc injury. With abduction stress, we were able to show a significantly greater difference between pre- and post-injury motion and the ability of both fixation methods to restrain motion to pre-injury levels. Clinical Relevance: Abduction stress may be valuable when diagnosing and testing the transverse ligamentous Lisfranc injury. Both suture-button and screw fixation methods restrain motion at the Lisfranc complex.

Materials and Methods: A 3-dimensional finite element model of a mandible was created and graphically simulated on a computer screen. The model was fixed with 3 different techniques: a 2.0-mm plate with 4 screws, 2 plates (1 1.5-mm plate and 1 2.0-mm plate) with 4 screws, and a neck screw. Loads were applied that simulated muscular action, with restrictions of the upper movements of the mandible, differentiation of the cortical and medullary bone, and the virtual `` folds'' of the plates and screws so that they could adjust to the condylar surface. Afterward, the data were exported for graphic visualization of the results and quantitative analysis was performed. Results: The 2-plate technique exhibited better stability in regard to displacement of fractures, deformity of the synthesis materials, and minimum and maximum tension values. The results with the neck screw were satisfactory and were similar to those found when a miniplate was used. Conclusion: Although the study shows that 2 isolated plates yielded better results compared with the other groups using other fixation systems and methods, the neck screw could be an option for condylar fracture reduction.

The copolymer was characterized by FT-IR, gel permeation chromatography, and thermal gravimetric analysis. The molecular structure of crosslinked unsaturated poly(ester-amide) was determined by wide-angle X-ray diffraction. Hydroxyapatite (n-HA) was used to boost up the new unsaturated poly (ester-amide), the flexural properties of n-HA/unsaturated poly(ester-amide) nanocomposites with different n-HA content were measured. Studies of degradation behavior were carried out in simulated body fluid at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C, the flexural strength changes and cumulative mass loss of n-HA/unsaturated poly(ester-amide) nanocomposites were measured at different degradation times. The n-HA/unsaturated poly(ester-amide) nanocomposites was hydrolyzed in 1M NaOH standard solution at room temperature to study the mass loss with different n-HA contents. All the preliminary results suggested that n-HA/unsaturated poly(ester-amide) nanocomposites might be potentially used as a new type of bone fixation material. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The aim of the present study was to assess and compare clinical and radiological results between arthroscopically assisted reduction and internal fixation (ARIF) and open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) procedures. The study hypothesis was that, in selected tibial plateau fractures, ARIF provides (1) clinical results comparable to those of ORIF, and (2) satisfactory reduction and stable fixation. Material and method: A retrospective multicenter study included adult patients with tibial plateau fracture (Schatzker I to III), over the period January 2010 to December 2014, enabling a minimum 2 years' follow-up. Clinical and radiological data (RoM, IKDC, HSS, Lysholm) were collected at 3, 6 and 12 months and at last follow-up. A total of 317 patients (317 fractures), aged 48 +/- 14 years (range, 18-82 years) were followed up for 38 +/- 23 months (range, 24-90 months), with 77 fractures (24%) in the ARIF group and 240 (76%) in the ORIF group. Results: Clinically, there were no significant inter-group differences for active flexion, passive or active extension or Lysholm and IKDC scores, with significant differences for HSS (ARIF: 74 +/- 29; ORIF: 70 +/- 31; p < 0.01) and passive flexion (ARIF: 130 +/- 19 degrees (range, 80-160 degrees); ORIF: 130 +/- 15.965 degrees (range, 60-140 degrees); p < 0.05). Radiologically, there were no significant inter-group differences for reduction quality, lower-limb mechanical axis or signs of osteoarthritis. There were no secondary displacements. There were 7 complications (7/77, 9%) in the ARIF group and 18 (18/240, 8%) in the ORIF group, and 6 surgical revisions for early infection (2 ARIF, 4 ORIF), with no significant inter-group differences. Discussion: The study hypothesis was confirmed: in Schatzker I-III fractures, ARIF provided clinical results comparable to those of ORIF, with satisfactory reduction and stable fixation. ARIF has its place in the treatment of tibial plateau subsidence and/or separation fracture. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

There is no research comparing this technique with traditional tension band wiring (TBW) and the single plate technique. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of three fixation techniques in olecranon fractures. Materials and methods From March 2016 to May 2020, we collected the clinical data of 95 patients with olecranon fractures who underwent surgical treatment. Thirty-five patients received TBW surgery (TBW Group), 32 patients received a 3.5 mm locking compression plate (LCP, 3.5 mm LCP Group), and 28 patients received double mini-locking plate treatment (DP Group). The operation time, fracture union time, time of return to work, range of motion (ROM), soft tissue stimulation to remove internal fixation, and patient-related functional results (the Weseley score, Mayo Elbow Performance Score [MEPS], and Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand Score [DASH]) were recorded. The clinical results and complications of the three internal fixation techniques were compared. Results The average follow-up time was 15.011.82 months (12-18 months). All patients' fractures healed by first intention. There were no statistically significant differences in the operation time, fracture union time, ROM, Weseley score, MEPS or DASH scores of the three groups of patients. The postoperative return time for patients in the TBW group was 10.002.15 weeks, the 3.5 mm LCP group was 9.561.93 weeks, and the DP group was 8.432.38 weeks (P = 0.014); 12 patients in the TBW group required removal of plant due to soft tissue stimulation, the 3.5 mm LCP group had 8 cases, and the DP group had 2 cases (P = 0.038). Conclusion The postoperative clinical results and elbow joint function of patients with olecranon fractures fixed by tension band wiring, 3.5 mm LCP and double mini-locking plate are similar, which indicates that double-plate technology can be used as an alternative to the two groups of traditional techniques. In addition, double-plate technology also helps patients return to work earlier and has a lower incidence of soft tissue stimulation.

J	Liu, K; Liu, PC; Liu, R; Wu, X				Liu, Kuan; Liu, Peng-cheng; Liu, Run; Wu, Xing			Advantage of Minimally Invasive Lateral Approach Relative to Conventional Deltopectoral Approach for Treatment of Proximal Humerus Fractures	MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR			English	Article						Internal Fixators; Retrospective Studies; Shoulder Fractures; Surgical Procedures; Minimally Invasive	LOCKING PLATE FIXATION; INTERNAL-FIXATION; SUPPORT	Background: Despite the wide application of open reduction and internal fixation with locking plates for the treatment of proximal humeral fractures, the surgical invasive approach remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the pros and cons of the minimally invasive lateral approach for the treatment of proximal humeral fracture (PHF) in comparison with the deltopectoral approach. Material/Methods: All patients who sustained a PHF and received open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery with locking plate through either minimally invasive subacromial approach or conventional deltopectoral approach between January 2008 and February 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into the conventional group and min-group according to the surgical incision. Surgery-related information, postoperative radiography, complications, and shoulder functional measurement scores in a 2-year follow-up were collected and evaluated. Results: Ninety-one patients meeting the inclusion criteria were included in this study. We observed a significant difference in both surgery time (81.8 +/- 18.3 vs. 91.0 +/- 18.4) (p=0.021) and blood loss (172 +/- 54.2 vs. 205 +/- 73.6) (p=0.016) between the min-group and conventional group. Compared to the conventional group, the min-group had significantly better Constant-Murley score and DASH score at early follow-up (p<0.05) and higher patients satisfaction rate (8.1 +/- 1.1 vs. 7.6 +/- 1.2) (p=0.019). The multiple linear regression analysis indicated that age, PHF types, surgical groups, surgery time, and blood loss have significant effect on the activity of affected shoulder in both abduction and forward flexion (p<0.05) except for gender factor. While larger range of movement of the affected shoulder, mainly in the 2-part and 3-part fractures, was observed in the min-group, the conventional group obtained better movement in the 4-part fractures. Conclusions: The minimally invasive lateral approach is the optimal alternative for the treatment of Neer's type 2 and 3 proximal humerus fractures.

However, how the plate systems constituting these devices change during long-term use in vivo is unknown. In this study, we present cases of two patients fitted with u-HA/PLLA devices for >5 years after surgery and evaluate the resorption process on the basis of the residual versus the resorbed material. In both cases, the majority of the degraded plates and screws had been replaced by bone. In post-operative three-dimensional (3D) CT imaging, plate and screws were maintained until two years after surgery, and then they were degraded and replaced to bone in 4-6 years after surgery. Examination of the aggregation of hydroxyapatite and decrease in molecular weight suggested that the residual material was in the final stages of resorption. The plate system examined demonstrated stable degradation without foreign body reactions in vivo. Although complete resorption is a lengthy process, it is possible to follow its progress using CT.

Inclusion criteria were a closed displaced intra-articular fracture of the calcaneus, no compartment syndrome, and adequate followup. Followup ranged from 4 months to 4 years. Results: One patient had a deep wound infection that required removal of hardware and intravenous antibiotics. No deep dehiscence or flap necrosis occurred. Superficial dehiscence occurred in three patients (4%) and superficial necrosis was seen in nine patients (12%); all resolved with continued casting to protect the wound. Six patients (8%) complained of numbness or pain in the sural nerve distribution. No symptomatic neuromas were seen. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy occurred in three patients (4%); all resolved with sympathetic blocks. Only one patient required an additional procedure for treatment of a wound-related problem or infection. Conclusion: The "smile" incision provides good fracture exposure for reduction without added morbidity.

Materials and methods : All patients undergoing cannulated hip screws at a single UK Major Trauma Centre between November 2009 and November 2011 were retrospectively identified. Radiographs were analysed for fracture displacement, successful reduction, and screw configuration. Risk factors predicting early failure, defined as re-operation within 6 months, were identified using logistic regression models. Results : 340 patients were included in the study, 70% were female and the mean age was 81 years. After six months 23% patients had undergone revision surgery. Initial fracture displacement (p = 0.02) and unsuccessful lateral reduction (p = 0.04) were significant predictors of early failure. Conclusion : Initial fracture displacement and successful fracture reduction are the most important factors related to the risk of early re-operation. We found no evidence that screw configuration is an important predictor of outcome.

Comparison of Modified Transiliac Internal Fixators: Mechanical Testing on Pelvic Models	ACTA CHIRURGIAE ORTHOPAEDICAE ET TRAUMATOLOGIAE CECHOSLOVACA			English	Article						transforaminal sacral fracture; transiliac internal fixator; dual TIFI; stability; biomechanics; digital image correlation	FRAGILITY FRACTURES; SURGICAL TECHNIQUE; RING INJURIES; FIXATION; STABILIZATION; ROD	PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Vertically unstable transforaminal sacral fractures can be stabilized with several types of transiliac internal fixators (TIFI): the classical one (TIFI-C), the supraacetabular one (TIFI-A) and by dual application of TIFI (DTIFI). MATERIAL AND METHODS Pelvic models made of solid foam (Sawbones 1301) were used in the study. Mechanical loading tests were performed in order to assess the stiffness of the studied pelvic structures. The stiffness of the intact model was approximated as the slope of load/displacement curve. Then vertically unstable right-sided linear transforaminal fracture was created and subsequently fixed by TIFI-C, TIFI-A and DTIFI (each fixator for a separate model). The fixation techniques were compared based on the ratio between the stiffness of the treated and of the intact pelvis. Motion of the posterior pelvic structures and their deformations were measured using a photogrammetric system with four synchronous cameras. Loads applied at the base of sacrum and sacral base displacements were recorded by the testing device and used to assess the stiffness of the model structure. A dedicated load cell and a monoaxial extensometer were utilised. Every measurement was repeated at least 10 times. Obtained data were analysed by one way ANOVA test with post hoc comparison by Tukey HSD test. RESULTS Mean stiffness ratio (+/- 1SD) of pelvic structure was 0.638 +/- 0.005 for TIFI-C, 0.722 +/- 0.014 for TIFI-A and 0.720 +/- 0.008 for DTIFI. Dual transiliac internal fixation and supraacetabular fixation were superior to the classical one (p < 0.0001), but DTIFI and TIFI-A stiffness ratios were statistically equivalent (p = 0.9112). CONCLUSIONS Results of the mechanical analysis using pelvic models indicate that for linear vertical transforaminal sacral fracture without comminuted zone, an application of either TIFI-A or DTIFI provides significantly higher stiffness of the lateral pelvic segment than application of TIFI-C.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the radiologic results and the incidence of complications following cerclage wire application and plate fixation in the treatment of comminuted mid-shaft clavicle fractures. Materials and methods: A total of 116 patients with comminuted mid-shaft clavicle fractures who underwent open reduction and internal fixation were reviewed. We analyzed the postoperative length ratio and bone union period according to the fracture classification, patient age, the number of fragments and the number of applied wires. The thickness of the fracture site was compared with the normal contralateral clavicle shaft. Results: Bone union was confirmed in all enrolled patients at an average of 14.9 +/- 4.67 weeks. There are no significant differences in the length ratio or bone union period among the subgroups (including the fracture types, age, number of fragments and applied wires). The diameter at the occupied area was not significantly from that on the normal side (p = .505). Conclusions: The application of a single cerclage or multiple cerclage wires around the fracture site did not hamper the clavicle shaft fracture healing. This result suggests that cerclage wires should not be avoided, but can be used as a viable treatment option for clavicle shaft fractures. Level of evidence: IV. (C) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The objective of this study was to assess the functional and radiological outcomes and to describe the complications of surgical treatment in this older population. Hypothesis: Surgery is the optimal treatment for displaced olecranon fractures in patients aged 75 years or over. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the files of patients who were 75 years of age or older when they underwent surgery for displaced olecranon fractures at our centre between January 2013 and December 2017. Functional and radiological outcomes were assessed at radiological fracture healing or at last follow-up. Results: We included 29 patients with 30 fractures. Mean age was 82 years (range, 75-93 years). All 30 fractures were Mayo II or III, A or B. Tension-band wiring was used for 21 fractures, locked-plate fixation for 7 fractures, and double-plate fixation for 2 fractures. The mean Mayo Elbow Performance Score was 82.5 (range, 45-100). Complications occurred for 11 (37%) fractures, and the material was removed for 11 (37%) fractures. Discussion: The complications resulted from a mismatch between fracture type, bone quality, and the internal fixation material. Compared to tension-band wiring, plate fixation was associated with more complications, many of which required removal of the material. Tension-band wiring was not sufficient for proximal fractures and type III B fractures, for which lacing is an alternative. Conservative functional treatment remains a wise option for type II olecranon fractures in these elderly patients. Surgery is required, however, in patients with type III fractures (fracture-dislocations). Level of evidence: IV, retrospective, single-centre, observational cohort study.

Material and methods: Fifty-five class II malocclusion patients treated with the use of bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy and mandibular advancement were selected for this retrospective study. Group 1 (n = 17) had miniplates with monocortical screws, Group 2 (n = 16) had bicortical screws and Group 3 (n = 22) had the osteotomy fixed by means of the hybrid technique. Cephalograms were taken preoperatively, 1 week within the postoperative care period, and 6 months after the orthognathic surgery. Linear and angular changes of the cephalometric landmarks of the chin region were measured at each period, and the changes at each cephalometric landmark were determined for the time gaps. Postoperative changes in the mandibular shape were analyzed to determine the stability of fixation methods. Results: There was minimum difference in the relapse of the mandibular advancement among the three groups. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference in postoperative stability. However, a positive correlation between the amount of advancement and the amount of postoperative relapse was demonstrated by the linear multiple regression test (p < 0.05). Conclusion: It can be concluded that all techniques can be used to obtain stable postoperative results in mandibular advancement after 6 months.

The aim of this study was to identify which of the two treatments leads to better outcomes (clinically and radiographically) with fewer complications. Materials and Methods: A metaanalysis was performed. All available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which compared the clinical results of VP to EF were obtained and the reported means and standard deviations were extracted to perform data synthesis. Results: A total of 9 published RCTs with 776 patients fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Data analysis revealed that VP gives better clinical results in the early postoperative period in terms of disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) scores (3 and 6 months), grip strength (3 months), flexion, extension, and supination (3 months). VP is also advantageous over EF regarding the DASH scores, maintenance of ulnar variance, and total and mild surgical complications at 12 months. Conclusions: This meta analysis supports the use of VP in treating distal radius fractures.

Over time, the literature has shown many types of treatment modalities and different kinds of internal fixation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes and complications of mandibular angle fractures managed by Champy's technique and two-plate fixation, over a period of 20 years. Material and methodsThe files of 149 patients with 155 angle fractures fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were chosen for this study. Data were collected regarding gender, age, race, date of trauma, addictions, etiology, signs and symptoms, fracture management, and complications. ResultsPrevalence was higher in males (82%), Caucasians (62%), and during the third decade of life (62%). Mean age was 26.5 years. The main cause was interpersonal violence, and the mean follow-up period was 232 days. The main signs and symptoms were pain, edema, and mouth-opening restriction. The most often associated fracture involved the mandibular condyle, and the most common complication was infection. ConclusionThere was no difference between the two modalities of treatment. However, the one-plate fixation technique had fewer complications.

We aimed to investigate the effect of our original device-free compressed shell fixation method and breathing instruction on suppression of respiratory movement. The characteristics of liver motion based on the movement of a fiducial marker were also analyzed. Methods and Materials: First, respiratory amplitudes of the liver with the device-free compressed shell were analyzed from the data of 146 patients. The effect of this shell fixing method on liver movement was evaluated. Second, as another cohort study with 166 patients, interfractional internal motion of the liver for patients fixed in the shell was calculated using the fiducial marker coordinate data of images for position setting before daily irradiation. Third, in another 12 patients, intrafractional internal motion was calculated from the fiducial marker coordinate data using x-ray images before and after irradiation. Results: The median respiratory movement without the shell, after fixing with the shell, and after instructing on the breathing method with the shell was 14.2 (interquartile range, 10.7-19.8), 11.5 (8.6-17.5), and 10.4 mm (7.3-15.8), respectively. Systematic and random errors of interfractional internal motion were all <= 2 mm in the left-right and anteroposterior directions and 3.7 and 3.0 mm, respectively, in the craniocaudal direction. Systematic and random errors of intrafractional internal motion were all <= 1.3 mm in the left-right and anteroposterior directions and 0.8 and 2.4 mm, respectively, in the craniocaudal direction. Conclusions: The device-free compressed shell fixation method was effective in suppressing the respiratory movement of the liver. Irradiation position matching using the fiducial marker can correct the interfractional internal motion on each day, which would contribute to the reduction of the margin to be given around the target.

Material/Methods: The study group consisted of 33 patients treated for radial nerve palsy after humeral fractures. Patients were diagnosed based on clinical examinations, ultrasonography, electromyography, or nerve conduction velocity. During each operation, the location and type of nerve damage were analyzed. During the reconstructive treatment, neurolysis, direct neurorrhaphy, or reconstruction with a sural nerve graft was used. The outcomes were evaluated using the Medical Research Council (MRC) scales and the quick DASH score. Results: Secondary radial nerve palsy occurs after open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) by plate, as well as by closed reduction and internal fixation (CRIF) by nail. In the case of ORIF, it most often occurs when the lateral approach is used, as in the case of CRIF with an insertion interlocking screws. The results of the surgical treatment were statistically significant and depended on the time between nerve injury and revision (reconstruction) surgery, type of damage to the radial nerve, surgery treatment, and type of fixation. Treatment results were not statistically significant, depending on the type of fracture or location of the nerve injury. Conclusions: The potential risk of radial nerve neurotmesis justifies an operative intervention to treat neurological complications after a humeral fracture. Adequate surgical treatment in many of these cases allows for functional recovery of the radial nerve.

We performed a retrospective analysis of extended distal chevron osteotomy and Akin osteotomy for the treatment of moderate to severe hallux valgus (33 patients, 42 feet). Fixation of extended distal chevron osteotomy and Akin osteotomy was performed using poly-L-lactic acid pins and polylactic acid/polyglycolic acid copolymer sutures, respectively. The radiological outcomes were evaluated based on the preoperative and 3-year follow-up intermetatarsal angle, hallux valgus angle, and hallux interphalangeal angle. The clinical results were assessed according to 3-year follow-up Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire scores, patient satisfaction, and postoperative complications. All radiological and clinical results were compared with those of a control group treated with metallic implants. The mean 3-year follow-up intermetatarsal angle, hallux valgus angle, and hallux interphalangeal angle were significantly corrected from the preoperative values (all p < .001). The mean 3-year follow-up Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire scores score was significantly improved from the preoperative values (p < .001). Regarding patient satisfaction, 88.1% of the patients reported good to excellent results. A total of seven complications were reported. All radiological and clinical results were comparable with those of control group treated with metallic implant. Based on these results, we recommend using bioabsorbable materials as another reliable device for fixation of extended distal chevron osteotomy and Akin osteotomy even for the treatment of moderate to severe hallux valgus.

METHODS: Among 52 consecutive cases, odontoid nonunion occurred in 33 patients, atlantoaxial instability in 11 patients, and occipitocervical deformity in 8 patients who underwent posterior C1-C2 transarticular screw/screw-rod internal fixation (41 cases) and occi-pitocervical fusion (11 cases) with the improved bone graft technique. Each surgical procedure was performed by the same senior spine surgeon. We took lateral cervical standing roentgenograms before surgery and immediately after surgery. Then we conducted craniocerebral computed tomography examination with reconstruction at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months and annually thereafter. The postoperative follow-up times are about 12-38 months. RESULTS: All cases showed satisfactory screw fixation by radiographic examination, and there were no postoperative neurologic complications. One case had postoperative retropharyngeal infection after the transoral release and posterior reduction by pedicle screw instrumentation. All patients got solid fusions, and no pseudarthrosis occurred. All cases had solid fusions at the 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: Good bone graft bed, enough bone graft material, solid local fixation, and effective bone graft method are prerequisites for a successful bone graft. By analyzing postoperative follow-up in the consecutive cases in this study, our bone graft method describing a new bone graft structure is a reliable posterior fusion technique. It is worth considering, and further research is needed.

Materials and methods: This retrospective cohort study included patients with mandibular subcondylar fractures treated with EAORIF using bioabsorbable unsintered hydroxyapatite/poly L-lactide composite plates or titanium miniplate systems. The outcome variables included preoperative fracture conditions, postoperative stability during fracture healing, and complications during the follow-up period. Other variables included clinical characteristics (age, sex, fracture site, and total follow-up duration) and intraand postoperative data (surgical duration, duration of intermaxillary fixation/elastic band guidance). Variables were evaluated using descriptive statistics and compared between groups using the Manne Whitney test and the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Results: In total, 28 patients were analyzed, including 13 who underwent EAORIF using bioabsorbable plates and 15 who underwent EAORIF using titanium miniplates. With the exception of second surgery for plate removal, none of the assessed variables showed significant differences between the two groups (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our results suggest that EAORIF using biodegradable plates is a stable and reliable method for the management of mandibular subcondylar fractures and eliminates the need for secondary surgery for plate removal.

It can be encountered both in the pediatric and adult population. A wide array of surgical techniques have been proposed to manage displaced tibial spine avulsions. Anyway, insufficient evidence is currently available to prefer one fixation technique over another, and a gold-standard arthroscopy-based technique is still missing. In this article, we describe a mini-invasive, safe and user-friendly technique for arthroscopic reduction and internal fixation of displaced tibial eminence fractures. Materials and methods: Standard and patient-specific accessory arthroscopic portals allow for full access to knee visualization and management of concomitant intraarticular lesions. After performing the debridement of the inflammatory tissue and the release of eventual interposed tissues in the fracture site, the tibial eminence avulsion can be reduced by using a less-invasive bone impactor. With the knee flexed to 90 & DEG;, the fracture fragments are then synthesized (under fluoroscopic control) with three thin Kirschner wires inserted in a proximal-distal direction in a cross-shaped geometry. Results: This technique allows a fast surgical and hospitalization time, a punctiform arthrotomy, proximal tibial physis preservation, and an early rehabilitation program. Conclusions: This novel technique seems attractive and very promising since it is respectful of the epiphyseal growth plates and is thus suitable for children and adolescents.

A Comparative Study of Femoral Neck System versus Cannulated Compression Screw	MEDICINA-LITHUANIA			English	Article						femoral neck system; cannulated screws; femur neck fractures; internal fixation	AVASCULAR NECROSIS; CHILDREN; HIP; FIXATION; FEMUR	Background and Objectives: The femoral neck system (FNS) is a new minimally invasive internal fixation system for femoral neck fractures (FNFs), but its use has not been reported in adolescents. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of displaced FNF in adolescents treated with FNS or a cannulated compression screw (CCS). Materials and Methods: A retrospective study of 58 consecutive patients with displaced FNF treated surgically was performed; overall, 28 patients underwent FNS and 30 CCS fixation. Sex, age at injury, type of fracture, associated lesions, duration of surgery, radiation exposure, and blood loss were collected from the hospital database. The clinical and radiographic results, as well as complications, were recorded and compared. Results: The patients were followed up for 16.4 +/- 3.1 months on average after index surgery (range, 12 to 24). Consolidation time among patients treated with FNS was significantly lower than those managed by CCS (p = 0.000). The functional scores of patients treated with FNS were significantly higher than those managed by CCS (p = 0.030). Unplanned hardware removal in patients treated with FNS was significantly lower than in those managed by CCS (p = 0.024). Conclusions: FNS has a lower complication rate and better functional outcome than CCS. It may be a good alternative to treat femoral neck fractures in adolescents.

Studies on biostable fibrous composites have recently demonstrated that these materials have a range of properties which make them suitable for orthopedic applications. In this study, three different three-dimensional (3-D) braided composites, carbon fiber-epoxy (C3D/EP), Kevlar fiber-epoxy (K3D/EP) and carbon fiber-poly(methyl methacrylate) (C3D/PMMA), were assessed in terms of mechanical properties and in-vitro durability to evaluate the feasibility of these composites as potential biomaterials. In addition, comparisons with other reported composites in original strength and modulus and in-vitro degradation were also made. Our studies indicate that a material with an appropriate stiffness combined with sufficient flexural and shear strength and high impact strength can be gained by tuning the combination of fiber and matrix, which opens an effective way of replacing conventional metallic devices with fibrous composites.

This study aimed to compare the clinical results of the percutaneous compression plate (PCCP) with parallel screws (PS) in treating femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.Materials and methods A total of 218 patients who underwent internal fixation were randomized to receive either a percutaneous compression plate (PCCP group) or parallel screws (PS group) using a computerized random sequence generator which was used to assign the order of randomization. Patients were assessed by the operating time, intraoperative blood loss, hemoglobin level drop, postoperative hospital stay, the time to full weight-bearing, reduction quality, fracture healing time, Harris hip score, and postoperative complications.Results There was no significant difference between PCCP and PS groups regarding operative time, intraoperative blood loss, hemoglobin level drop, postoperative hospital stays, reduction quality, and Harris hip score (p > 0.05). The time to full weight-bearing and the fracture healing time in the PCCP group were shorter than those in the PS group (p < 0.05). The overall complication rates were slightly lower in the PCCP compared to the PS patients, but there was no significant difference (p > 0.05). However, the implant failure rate was significantly higher in the PS group compared to the PCCP group (p < 0.05).Conclusions The present study suggests that the PCCP is superior to the parallel screws fixation in the treatment of non-displaced elderly femoral neck fractures in terms of earlier full weight-bearing, shorter fracture healing time, and lower implant failure rate. Therefore, it may be a better therapeutic strategy for non-displaced femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.

SoFCOT	Locked plating for internal fixation of the adult distal femur: Influence of the type of construct and hardware on the clinical and radiological outcomes	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Distal femur; Fracture; Supracondylar fracture; Supra and intercondylar fracture; Internal fixation; Locked plating	INVASIVE STABILIZATION SYSTEM; FEMORAL FRACTURES; LOCKING PLATES; MORTALITY; SCREW	Introduction: Distal femoral fractures are rare and serious. Along with traditional internal fixation, new, dedicated hardware have appeared (distal nails, locked plating). We report the results of a multicenter prospective study of these fractures treated with locked plating. Hypothesis: The short-term results are satisfactory and related to the type of construct and the hardware used, with better results for elastic assemblies and titanium implants. Materials and methods: From June 2011 to May 2012, 92 patients, mean age 64 years, were included in 12 centres. The fractures were classified as follows: 44 type A, 7 type B, and 41 type C according to the AO classification. Thirteen fractures were open. The plates were uniaxial. The assemblies were elastic in 52 cases, rigid in 26, and unconventional in 14. Results: Seventy-six patients underwent a radiological follow-up at 6 months and 66 patients had a clinical result evaluated at 1 year. The mean range of motion was 100. and the mean IKS score was 122. The bone union rate was 87% within 12 weeks. Seven valgus, two varus, ten flexion deformities, and three recurvatum greater than 5. were observed (19.5%). Revisions involved two cases with loss of fixation, five cases of infection, and one case of arthrofibrosis (requiring arthroscopic arthrolysis). Secondary bone grafting was carried out in seven cases (four successfully). No influence of the type of assembly or the hardware used was demonstrated. Discussion: The results remain modest, underscoring the severity of these fractures. Neither the type of construct nor the hardware used influenced the radiological and clinical outcomes. The hypothesis was not confirmed. Level of evidence: Level IV prospective, non-comparative study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The numerical study of bone healing process of a transverse fractured tibia was conducted in this research to reduce the stress shielding. The stress and strain on the callus were evaluated when bone plates of different metallic and non-metallic biomaterials were used. Time varying material properties of the callus were applied, and loading conditions were coupled with material properties of the callus. The strain distribution on the callus, and the maximum stress on the callus and bone plate were analysed. The analysis results shows that Polyether ether ketone/Nano-Hydroxyapatite/Short Carbon Fibre (PEEK/nano-HA/SCF) is most suitable for bone plating application for tibia. PEEK/nano-HA/SCF is chosen as it provides the optimum strain in the callus to promote bone healing. It has the closest stiffness to the cortical bone and hence stress shielding is minimized extensively. It has a uniform strain distribution at the fractured site for early bone healing process.

Hypothesis: We hypothesized that high posterior tilt angle and retroversion angle are related to high incidence of non-union and osteonecrosis. Materials and methods: From January 2009 to December 2016, 64 elderly patients in two institutions with non-displaced or valgus impaction fractures of the femoral neck who had internal fixation using multiple parallel cannulated screws were enrolled. To determine the independent predictors of nonunion, osteonecrosis, and re-operation, various clinical variables and radiologic variables, including the valgus angle on coronal CT images, the posterior tilt angle on Lorenz images, and the retroversion angle on axial CT images, were analyzed. Results: Non-union was identified in nine of the 64 patients (14.1%) and nine of the 55 patients (16.4%) who achieved bony union had femoral head osteonecrosis with subsequent segmental collapse. The multiple logistic regression model showed that a low bone mineral density of the femur, a higher posterior tilt angle on Lorenz image, and a higher retroversion angle on axial CT images were independent predictors of non-union and re-operation.

Application of polylactides in spinal cages: Studies in a goat model	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Polymers in Medicine and Surgery (PIMS2004)	SEP 06-08, 2004	Cambridge, ENGLAND				LUMBAR INTERBODY FUSION; IN-VIVO DEGRADATION; L-LACTIC ACID; FOLLOW-UP; BONE; VITRO; BIOCOMPATIBILITY; POLY(L-LACTIDE); IMPLANT; DESIGN	Spinal cages are currently made of non-resorbable materials, but they only have a temporary function: after fusion, resorption is desirable both from a biological and mechanical point of view. We studied different polylactides in stand-alone condition in a goat model. Cages were made of 100% poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) or 70/30 poly(L/DL-Lactic acid) (PLDLLA); titanium served as control. After six months, all titanium cages showed non-unions comparable to that observed in a clinical retrieval, thus showing validity of the goat model. PLLA cages maintained their mechanical integrity for six months, enough to allow fusion. After that, the material resorbed within 48 months without adverse tissue reactions. Bone formation was faster in PLDLLA cages, but these already failed within three months, thus losing their stabilising function: 50% ended in pseudo-arthrosis. Additional internal fixation provided enough stability for fusion (83%). Biocompatibility of both PLLA and PLDLLA was excellent. The long-term results show that PLLA cages can be used for stand-alone interbody fusion, and that PLLA is an improvement over titanium in terms of fusion rate. PLDLLA showed enhanced bone formation, but also earlier failure of the implant. Chances for spinal fusion were better with additional internal fixation.

Lateral drill holes decrease strength of the femur: an observational study using finite element and experimental analyses	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND RESEARCH			English	Article						Femur fracture; Internal fracture fixation; Intramedullary fixation; Finite element analysis; Stress; Mechanical; Materials testing	FAT-EMBOLISM SYNDROME; INTRAMEDULLARY PRESSURE; BONE; FRACTURES; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Background: Internal fixation of femoral fractures requires drilling holes through the cortical bone of the shaft of the femur. Intramedullary suction reduces the fat emboli produced by reaming and nailing femoral fractures but requires four suction portals to be drilled into the femoral shaft. This work investigated the effect of these additional holes on the strength of the femur. Methods: Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to calculate compression, tension and load limits which were then compared to the results from mechanical testing. Models of intact femora and fractured femora internally fixed with intramedullary nailing were generated. In addition, four suction portals, lateral, anterior and posterior, were modelled. Stresses were used to calculate safety factors and predict fatigue. Physical testing on synthetic femora was carried out on a universal mechanical testing machine. Results: The FEA model for stresses generated during walking showed tensile stresses in the lateral femur and compression stresses in the medial femur with a maximum sheer stress through the neck of the femur. The lateral suction portals produced tensile stresses up to over 300% greater than in the femur without suction portals. The anterior and posterior portals did not significantly increase stresses. The lateral suction portals had a safety factor of 0.7, while the anterior and posterior posts had safety factors of 2.4 times walking loads. Synthetic bone subjected to cyclical loading and load to failure showed similar results. On mechanical testing, all constructs failed at the neck of the femur. Conclusions: The anterior suction portals produced minimal increases in stress to loading so are the preferred site should a femur require such drill holes for suction or internal fixation.

In order to maximize the patient's quality of life, reconstruction of the craniomaxillofacial skeleton must seek to restore aesthetics as well as function. Advances in diagnostic technology, surgical technique, instrumentation, and innovative biomaterials used have transformed the way reconstructive surgeons approach their patients' needs. From the advent of alloplastic reconstruction, surgeons have sought the ideal material for use in craniomaxillofacial surgery. Substances such as metals, ceramics, glasses, and more recently resorbable polymers and bioactive materials have all been utilized. While autologous bone has remained widely-favored and the gold standard, synthetic alternatives remain a necessity when autologous reconstruction is not readily available. Today, alloplastic material, autografting via microvascular tissue transfer, hormone and growth factor-induced bone formation, and computer-aided design and manufacturing of biocompatible implants represent only a fraction of a wide range of options used in the reconstruction of the craniomaxillofacial skeleton. We present a brief review of the materials used in the repair of deformities of the craniomaxillofacial skeleton as well as a look into the potential future direction of the field.

Incidence for volar locking plate removal following distal radius fracture surgery	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Distal radius fracture; Surgery; Volar plate; Plate removal; Epidemiology	UNITED-STATES; CHANGING EPIDEMIOLOGY; INTERNAL-FIXATION; ADULT FRACTURES; COMPLICATIONS	Introduction Distal radius fracture is the most common fracture in adults. The most common treatment for distal radius fracture is non-operative cast immobilization, although there are injuries that require surgical treatment. During the past decade, studies have reported a large increase in the surgical treatment of distal radius fractures with open reduction and internal fixation using volar locking plates. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and trends for plate removal after plate fixation of distal radius fractures. Materials and methods The study covered all patients 18 years of age and older who had a surgically treated distal radius fracture with open reduction and internal fixation in Finland between 1998 and 2016. Patient data were obtained from the Finnish National Hospital Discharge Register. The association between increased number of platings and plate removals was examined by calculating the removal rates. The study population comprises all patients on a national level, and therefore we did not use statistical testing to analyze the data. Results A total of 18,298 patients had surgically treated distal radius fracture with volar plate in Finland during the 19-year study period from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2016. The number of plate removal operations over the same time period was 2560. The removal rates decreased from over 20% in 1998 to less than 12% in 2016. The mean time period between plating and plate removal operations was 367 days. Most of the plate removals (n = 2235; 87.3%) were conducted during the first 2 years after plating. Conclusion Plate removals have not increased as rapidly as plating operations. The removal rate has declined markedly during the last decade. Nowadays, approximately 11% of distal radius plates are removed.

Materials and methods: Two groups each with eight cadaveric elderly (mean age 72.6; range 70 to 80 year) frozen human humeri were used in the study. Transverse osteotomy of the proximal humerus was performed using a thin oscillating saw. The first group (group A) was fixed using two anterograde smooth K-wires, sent from lateral cortex, combined with tension band wiring. The second group (group B) was fixed using multi-planar (anterograde and retrograde) four smooth K-wires combined with tension band wiring on the lateral cortex. Biomechanical tensile properties for 3 mm displacement (gap load) and maximum load were assessed. Results: The mean value for the gap load was 1045.0 +/- 45.4 N (Newton) for group A and 1238.1 +/- 115.8 N for group B. Gap load values of groups were similar (p=0.01). The maximum load was 1261.8 +/- 52.4 N in group A and 1471.1 +/- 107.3 N in group B. The maximum load values were statistically higher in the multiplanar fixation technique (group B) when compared to that of the uniplanar fixation technique (group A), (p=0.004). Conclusion: Fixation in osteoporotic two-part surgical neck fractures of the proximal humerus using multiplanar K-wires combined with tension band wire provides substantially more effective stability compared to that of uniplanar fixation.

Biomechanical Comparison of Dynamic Hip Screw, Proximal Femoral Nail, Cannulated Screw, and Monoaxial External Fixation in the Treatment of Basicervical Femoral Neck Fractures	ACTA CHIRURGIAE ORTHOPAEDICAE ET TRAUMATOLOGIAE CECHOSLOVACA			English	Article						basicervical fracture; internal fixation; biomechanics	STRAIN DISTRIBUTION; PLATE FIXATION; GAMMA-NAIL; MODEL; FORCES; FEMUR	PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The objective of this study was to establish relative fixation strengths of proximal femoral nail (PFN), dynamic hip screw (DHS), monolateral external fixator (EF), and cannulated screw (CS) in basicervical hip fracture model. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study involved four groups of implanted composite proximal femoral synthetic bones of eight specimens per group; nailing with PFN, DHS, fixation with three cannulated screws, and EF. 70 osteotomy was performed to simulate a Pauwels Type 3 basicervical fracture. Minimum preload of 100 N was applied before loading to failure. The constructs were subjected to cyclic loading with 16 to midline from 100 N to 1,000 N for 10,000 cycles at 3Hz. Axial loading was applied at 10 mm/min until failure. Failure load, failure mode, and displacement were documented. RESULTS Mean failure load was 2182.5 +/- 377.9 N in PFN group, 2008.75 +/- 278.4 N in DHS group, 1941.25 +/- 171.6 N in EF group, and 1551.6 +/- 236.2 N in CS group. Average displacement was 15.6 +/- 4.5 mm, 15.5 +/- 6.7 mm, 11.7 +/- 1.9 mm, and 15 +/- 1.7 mm, respectively. No significant difference was noted among groups for fixation strength except CS group. All CS constructs failed during cyclic loading. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that PFN, DHS and EF achieved higher fixation strengths than CS in basicervical fracture. PFN has higher failure loads and possesses biomechanical benefits for fixation of unstable basicervical fractures compared with DHS and EF.	[Imren, Y.; Desteli, E.

However, this approach has a high rate of wound complications. The purpose of this study was to describe an alternative approach, the posteriorlateral approach (PLA) and compare it to the ELA regarding soft tissue complications and functional outcome. Materials and Methods: 32 patients operated through PLA and 66 patients treated through ELA were included in this retrospective study. Major and minor soft tissue complications up to 3 months postoperatively were recorded. Eighteen patients of the PLA group and 32 patients of the ELA group were available for 1-year functional outcome assessment with the American Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) score. Results: The PLA group had no major complications requiring surgical intervention. Six patients (19%) had minor wound complications. The ELA group had 8 (12%) major complications and 9 (14%) minor complications. There were no significant differences in AOFAS scores at 1-year followup. PLA is a safe and efficient approach for open reduction and internal fixation of displaced intraarticular calcaneal fractures. Conclusion: In selected cases when fracture comminution and displacement may not be adequately treated through a less invasive approach, it is a good alternative with less concern about wound complications as in ELA.

The current standard treatment of these fractures is percutaneous screw fixation due to its reduced risk of blood loss and shorter surgery times. However, this is an intricate surgical technique associated with high failure rates of up to 15%, related to implant failure and loss of reduction. Therefore, the aim of this biomechanical feasibility study was to develop and test a novel intramedullary splinting implant for fixation of superior pubic ramus fractures (SPRF), and to evaluate its biomechanical viability in comparison with established fixation methods using conventional partially or fully threaded cannulated screws. Materials and Methods: A type II superior pubic ramus fracture according to the Nakatani classification was created in 18 composite hemi-pelvises via a vertical osteotomy with an additional osteotomy in the inferior pubic ramus to isolate the testing of three SPRF fixation techniques performed in 6 semi-pelvises each using either (1) a novel ramus intramedullary splint, (2) a partially threaded ramus screw, or (3) a fully threaded ramus screw. Results: No significant differences were detected among the fixation techniques in terms of initial construct stiffness and number of cycles to failure, p >= 0.213. Conclusion: The novel ramus intramedullary splint can be used as an alternative option for treatment of pubic ramus fractures and has the potential to decrease the rate of implant failures due to its minimally invasive implantation procedure.

Biomechanical analysis of bicondylar tibial plateau fixation: How does lateral locking plate fixation compare to dual plate fixation?	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC TRAUMA			English	Article						tibial plateau fracture; biomechanics; locked plating; bicondylar fracture	LESS INVASIVE STABILIZATION; INTERNAL-FIXATION; CONDYLAR FRACTURES; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; EXTERNAL FIXATION; COMPLICATIONS; EXPERIENCE; REDUCTION; MODEL	Objectives: This study is designed to test the comparative strength of lateral-only locked plating to medial and lateral nonlocked plating in a cadaveric model of a bicondylar proximal tibial plateau fracture. Methods: Ten matched pairs of human cadaveric proximal tibia specimens were used for biomechanical testing. Cyclic loading using a materials testing device simulated initial range of motion and load bearing following surgical repair. Subsidence of the medial and the lateral condyles was measured following 10,000 cycles from 100N to 1,000N; the maximum load to failure on the medial condyle for both plate constructs was also measured. Results: On the lateral side, dual plating (DP) allowed an average of 0.68 +/- 0.14 mm of subsidence, compared with 1.03 +/- 0.27 mm for the fixed-angle plate (FAP) (P = 0.077). On the medial side, DP allowed an average of 0.78 +/- 0.15 mm of subsidence, compared with 1.51 +/- 0.32 mm for the FAP (P = 0.045). No significant difference was found in the maximal load to medial condyle fixation failure between either plating construct (P = 0.204). Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that dual-plate fixation allows less subsidence in this bicondylar tibial plateau cadaveric model when compared to isolated locked lateral plates. This may raise concerns about the widespread use of isolated lateral locked plate constructs in bicondylar tibial plateau fractures.

Use of the Locking Attachment Plate for Internal Fixation of Periprosthetic Femur Fractures	GERIATRIC ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY & REHABILITATION			English	Article						periprosthetic fracture; plate; femur fracture; locking plate attachment; fixation		Introduction: The locking attachment plate (LAP) can be added to a locking compression plate (LCP) to allow the fixation of locking screws bicortically around a femoral implant. We aimed to examine surgical and fracture characteristics associated with healing for periprosthetic femur fractures (PPFFx) treated with constructs employing LAP fixation. We hypothesize that the addition of an LAP provides stable peri-implant fixation. Materials &Methods: We retrospectively reviewed a consecutive series of 28 PPFFx surgically treated with LCP-LAP constructs by 4 surgeons from 2015-2020. Fractures were classified and grouped using the Vancouver Classification System and included 12 B1, 2 B2, 11 C fractures, and 3 fractures around other stemmed implants. Primary outcome measures included hardware failure such as screw pullout, broken screws, and plate fracture. Clinical complications including infection, non-union, malunion, and reoperation were recorded. Results: No LAP failures, screw pullout, or broken screws were observed. Two fractured plates (7.1%) occurred in patients with Vancouver C fracture types. Overall complication rate was 17.9% and included 3 non-unions, 1 deep infection, and 1 implant loosening with painful hardware, each requiring reoperation. Differences were observed between unions and nonunions for total number of screws (12.4 vs 14.7, P = .005) and number of locking screws used (8.04 vs 11.3, P = .03). Conclusion: The LAP provides adequate fixation and low failure rates where fixation is required around a well-fixed stem. When failures occur, it is from plate breakage and not due to failure of fixation at the area of plate-stem overlap.

This is also supported by biomechanical studies. However, the clinical usefulness of this biomechanical advantage is not known. This study evaluates the outcomes of displaced, comminuted ICNF fracture in young adults managed by four CCS fixation in diamond configuration. Materials and Methods: 25 patients who met the inclusion criteria were operated during the study period. Four patients were lost to followup in the first 6 weeks postoperatively, and one patient died in first 6 months of followup unrelated to surgery. Thus, twenty patients were followed up for a mean period of 33.3 months (range 25u38 months). In all patients, fracture fixation was done with four CCS in diamond configuration. Union at fracture site and avascular necrosis (AVN) of femoral head was assessed on serial plain radiographs. Functional outcome was evaluated by Harris hip score. Results: Eighteen patients had union, two patients had nonunion, and two patients had AVN of femoral head. All the sixteen patients who had union without AVN had good or excellent functional outcome. Conclusions: The present study concludes that four CCS fixation in diamond configuration appears to be a reasonable choice of fixation for displaced fracture ICNF with comminution in young adults. However, further evaluation with better study design and larger patient population is required for definite conclusions.

The purpose of this study is to report the outcome of surgical fixation of fifth metatarsal fractures using Acutrak (R) screw in elite football players. Material and Method: Three cases of fifth metatarsal fracture in elite football players. The mean age was 24 years old (18-26 years). We treated three fifth metatarsal fractures in elite football players. The cases in our study consisted of one diaphyseal fifth metatarsal fracture and two Jones fractures. The fractures had been occurred during sports participation. We applied internal fixation using a percutaneous Acutrak (R) screw under local anesthesia with the aid of fluoroscopy. The patients were clinically and radiographically evaluated. Results: Clinic healing was obtained at 10 weeks postoperatively Radiographic consolidation occurred at 8 weeks postoperatively and the patients returned to pre-injury activity levels at 11 weeks postoperatively. No postoperative complication was seen. No skin irritation due to a headless screw of Acutrak (R) was observed. Conclusion: The result suggested that Acutrak (R) may be used in elite football players with fifth metatarsal fractures. In spite of factors such as ease of implementation, cost and resistance to bending also need to be considered.

Closed reduction and percutaneus Kirschner wire fixation for the treatment of dislocated calcaneal fractures: surgical technique, complications, clinical and radiological results after 2-10 years	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						dislocated calcaneal fracture; minimal-invasive	DISPLACED INTRAARTICULAR FRACTURES; OPERATIVE TREATMENT; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OS CALCIS; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM	Introduction To reduce complications, a minimally invasive technique for the treatment of dislocated intraarticular fractures of the calcaneus was used. Therefore previously described closed reduction and internal fixation techniques were combined and modified. Materials and methods Sixty-seven out of 92 calcaneal fractures could be retrospectively evaluated with an average follow-up time of 5.7 years (minimum 2-10 years follow-up). For radiographic evaluation, plain radiographs and CT scans were obtained. The Zwipp score was used for clinical evaluation. Sanders type II, III and IV fractures were diagnosed. Results Length of surgery averaged 61 min (range 20-175 min). The incidence of subtalar arthritis was correlated to the severity of fracture. Bohler's angle was restored in 70.1% (47 of 67) of the cases. On the last follow-up evaluation the average Zwipp score was 130 points (range 48-186 points). The majority (77.7%) of patients were content with their treatment result. The rate of significant complications was 6.5%. Discussion Compared to open techniques the presented minimally invasive technique showed comparable results with a low rate of serious complications and is a viable alternative for the treatment of intraarticular, dislocated calcaneal fractures.

This article focuses on the surgical technique, indications, advantages, and results using wrist arthroscopy to assess articular reduction and evaluates the treatment of carpal ligament injuries and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) injuries in conjunction with the stable fixation of distal radial fractures. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 27 patients (16 males and 11 females), who underwent stable fixation of intraarticular distal radial fractures with arthroscopic evaluation of the articular reduction and repair of associated carpal injuries. As per the AO classification, they were 9 C 1, 12 C2, 2 C3, 3 B 1, and 1 B2 fractures. The final results were evaluated by modified Mayo wrist scoring system. The average age was 41 years (range: 18-68 years). The average followup was of 26 months (range 24-52 months). Results: Five patients needed modification of the reduction and fixation after arthroscopic joint evaluation. Associated ligament lesions found during the wrist arthroscopy were TFCC tears (n=17), scapholunate ligament injury (n=8), and luno-triquetral ligament injury (n=1). Five patients had combined injuries i.e. included TFCC tear, scapholunate and/or lunotriquetral ligament tear. There were 20 excellent, 3 good, and 4 fair results using this score. Conclusion: The radiocarpal and mid carpal arthroscopy is a useful adjunct to stable fixation of distal radial fractures.

Methods: An AO/OTA 33-A3 fracture was created in 24 sawbone femur specimens that simulated normal bone quality. Testing was performed on three groups: titanium unicortical LISS fixation, stainless steel unicortical LISS fixation, and bicortical stainless steel LISS fixation. Specimens were tested in axial, torsional, and cyclic axial loading in a materials testing machine. The outcome measurement was stiffness in axial and torsional loading, total deformation, and irreversible (plastic) deformation in cyclical axial loading. Results: No difference was found in stiffness in axial loading or plastic and total deformation between all three groups. There was a small decrease in stiffness in torsional loading in the titanium group compared with the stainless steel groups (p < 0.0001) and a small increase in stiffness in torsional loading with bicortical versus unicortical proximal fixation (p = 0.04). Conclusions: Unstable distal femur fracture constructs, created in sawbone specimens, fixed with stainless steel and titanium LISS implants, with or without bicortical locking screws proximally, show similar biomechanical properties under loading. Although there are numerous considerations when selecting implants for these fractures, our results indicate that stiffness is not a significant factor in choosing between the constructs tested.

Fusions at the craniovertebral junction	CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM			English	Article						craniovertebral junction instability; occipitocervical fusion	TRANSARTICULAR SCREW FIXATION; ANATOMICAL SUITABILITY; ODONTOID FRACTURES; CERVICAL-SPINE; AXIS FRACTURES; POSTERIOR; ARTHRODESIS; COMPLICATIONS; MANAGEMENT; PLACEMENT	Introduction The surgical management of craniovertebral junction instability in pediatric patients has unique challenges. While the indications for internal fixation in children are similar to those of adults, the data concerning techniques, complications, and outcomes of spinal instrumentation comes from experience with adult patients. Diminutive osseous and ligamentous structures and anatomical variations associated with syndromic craniovertebral abnormalities frequently complicates the approaches and limits the use of internal fixation in children. Cervical arthrodesis in the pediatric age group has the potential for limiting growth potential and causing secondary deformity. Recent advances in image analysis have enabled preoperative planning which is critical to evaluate the size of instrumentation and its relation to the patient's anatomy. Newer techniques have recently evolved and have been incorporated in the management of pediatric patients with requirement for craniocervical stabilization. Materials and methods Over 750 craniovertebral junction fusions have been reviewed in children. The indications for atlantoaxial arthrodesis were: (a) absent odontoid process, dystopic os odontoideum, absent posterior arch of C1; (b) Morquio's syndrome, Goldenhar's syndrome, Conradi's syndrome, and spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia. The acquired abnormalities of trauma, postinfectious instability, and Down's syndrome completed the indication in children. The indications for occipitocervical fusion were: (a) anterior and posterior bifid C1 arches with instability, absent occipital condyles; b) severe reducible basilar invagination, unstable dystopic os odontoideum, and unilateral atlas assimilation; (c) acquired phenomenon with traumatic occipitocervical dislocation, complex craniovertebral junction fractures of C1 and C2, after transoral craniovertebral junction decompression, cranial settling in Down's syndrome and inflammatory disease such as Grisel's syndrome. Instability was seen in children with clivus chordoma and osteoblastoma. Atlantoaxial fusions were performed mainly with interlaminar rib graft fusion and more recently with the transarticular screw fixation in the older patient. In the teenager, lateral mass screws at C1 and rod fixation were made; C2 pars interarticular screw fixation and C2 pedicle screw fixation. A C2 translaminar screw fixation is described. Occipitocervical fusions were made utilizing rib grafts below the age of 6. A contoured loop fixation was made in children above the age of 7, and recently, rod and screw fixation was also utilized. Results Abnormal cervical spine growth was not seen in children who underwent craniocervical stabilization below the age of 5. The authors have reserved rigid instrumentation for children above the age of 10 years and dependent on the anatomy.

Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects on healing of teeth in the line of mandibular fractures in order to contribute to the field. Material and Methods: The case notes of 100 patients with teeth in the line of 106 mandibular fractures were reviewed. Open reduction and rigid internal fixation (ORIF) was used if elastic intermaxillary reduction failed to achieve a satisfactory occlusion and/or anatomical reduction in the fragments as assessed by orthopantomogram (OPG) and clinical examination. The remaining cases had maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) with an arch bar and bridle wire. Results: Three of the 106 teeth involved in the fracture lines healed with complications. In the cases where the teeth had been removed prior to fracture treatment, or in cases of delayed extractions, no complications were noted. Conclusion: The factors which should be considered for removal include the condition of the teeth and alveolar bone, the timing and the type of treatment. This decision should be made on an individual basis considering potential risks to avoid complications.

Biomechanical analysis of locked and non-locked plate fixation of the clavicle	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Clavicle fracture; Osteosynthesis; Internal fixation; Biomechanics; Locking plate; Brachial plexus	KIRSCHNER WIRE; FRACTURES; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; MIGRATION; STABILITY; COMPLICATIONS; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Introduction: During plate fixation of clavicular fractures the brachial plexus and subclavian vessels are vulnerable to injury beneath the clavicle. Locking plate fixation allows for mono-cortical fixation, theoretically reducing the risk of injury to these structures. Biomechanical analysis of the performance of such fixation is limited, and this study was designed to explore this further as a treatment option in clavicle fractures. Materials and methods: Fixation of fifteen simulated mid-shaft fractures was undertaken using a combination of mono-cortical locked, bicortical locked and bicortical non-locked plating methods in cadaveric clavicles. Samples were then tested via three-point bending to destruction, and the performance of each with respect to failure load, bending stress, bending stiffness and Young's modulus was then analysed. The influence of the number of cortices engaged and locking was also assessed. Results: Clavicles fixed with monocortical locking plates displayed a significantly lower bending stress (12 +/- 1 MPa) than both the bicortical locking (28 +/- 3 MPa, p = 0.015) and non-locking specimens (24 +/- 3 MPa, p = 0.002). Engaging two cortices with the fixation produced a significant increase in failure load (291 +/- 28 N vs 138 +/- 48 N, p = 0.018) and bending stress (26 +/- 2 MPa vs 9.9 +/- 3.5 MPa, p = 0.002) compared to single cortex fixation. Discussion: The greatest influence upon the performance of the fixation was the number of cortices engaged, with bicortical fixation performing significantly better than mono-cortical. Whether or not the fixation device was a locking one did not have a significant bearing upon the performance. Conclusion: This in vitro biomechanical analysis demonstrates that mono-cortical locked plating fails at significantly lower levels of load and stress than bicortical locked and non-locked plating in mid-shaft fractures of the clavicle, and caution would therefore be advised in its use as a fixation modality for these injuries.

However, far cortical locking screws currently lack objective designs and anti-fatigue designs. This study investigates an optimization algorithm to form a special locking screw composed of various metals, which can theoretically achieve the maintenance of the excellent mechanical properties of far cortical locking constructs in terms of fracture internal fixation, while maintaining the biomechanical safety and fatigue resistance of the structure. The numerical results of our study indicate that the maximum von Mises stress of the optimized construct is less than the allowable stress of the material under each working condition while still achieving sufficient parallel interfragmentary motion. Numerical analysis of high cycle fatigue indicates that the optimized construct increases the safety factor to five. A high cycle fatigue test and defect analysis indicates that the sandwich locking constructs have better fatigue resistance. We conclude that the sandwich locking construct theoretically maintains its biomechanical safety and fatigue resistance while also maintaining excellent mechanical properties for fracture internal fixation.

As control group, titanium (Ti-6Al-4V Grade V) screws were used. For this purpose, 15 white New Zealand male rabbits, aged 6 months and weighing between 3.8 and 4.5 kg, were used. From each animal, 2 total-thickness bone grafts were removed from the cranial vault: one was stabilized with a resorbable screw while the other was stabilized with a metallic one. Animals were divided into 3 groups, according to the sacrifice period: 3, 8, and 16 weeks postoperatively. After histological processing, cuts were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and submitted for descriptive histological analysis under light microscopy. It was found that the fixation system based on the polymer showed a histological behavior similar to metallic screws. For both groups, the bone graft was incorporated, with the presence of bone formation between the graft and receptor site. In none of the groups were undesirable inflammatory responses or foreign body reactions observed. Based on histological findings and on this experimental model, it is possible to conclude that the internal fixation system based on the poly(L-co-D,L lactide) 70:30 polymer is effective for fixation of autogenous bone grafts, with results that are comparable to the titanium fixation system.

Stability of fixation plays an important role in determining the outcome. We prospectively studied 23 consecutive cases of hallux valgus treated with a scarf osteotomy, which were internally fixed with AO mini fragment screws. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the AO mini fragment screw used as fixation device in Scarf osteotomy. Materials and Methods: Twenty-three feet (I male, 16 female) were evaluated. Bilateral procedures were performed on six patients. Mean age was 46 years. The mean followup was 18 months. One surgeon performed all the procedures. Results: 43.5% of the patients were very satisfied, 52.2% were satisfied and 4.34% were not satisfied. All osteotomies united without any hardware complications. The mean global AOFAS score improved significantly from a preoperative score of 55 points to 91.95 (p < 0.001). The intermetatarsal, hallux valgus angle, and DMMA improved from the mean preoperative values of 15.9 degrees, 31.2 degrees, and 14.1 degrees to 9.1 degrees, 15.2 degrees, and 8.4 degrees, respectively (p < 0.001 for all) One patient developed a superficial wound infection, which responded to antibiotics and one patient developed a painful spur at first MTPJ. Conclusion: We conclude that this is a safe and simple technique of fixing a Scarf osteotomy. It is cost effective, provides stable fixation and maintains correction until the osteotomy unites.

The purpose of this study is to compare the rate of nonunion, prognosis, and complications at 6-12 months for surgically treated acute mid-shaft clavicle fractures when extra-periosteal dual-plate fixation is used in place of the conventional single-plate fixation. Materials and Methods: The comparative study was conducted on 47 patients who received acute mid-shaft clavicular fracture treatment in our hospital from March 2015 to July 2018. All patients were divided into dual-plate fixation treatment (group A) and single-plate fixation (group B). Patients undergoing single-plate fixation were compared to dual-plate fixation. Patients were followed up for 6-12 months. Charts were reviewed to assess union rates, prognosis, and complications. Results: Forty-seven clavicles (30 single plates and 17 dual plates) were evaluated. All patients (100%) in dual plating group and 128 (93.3%) in single plating group obtained bony union by 1 year. When comparing groups at 3 months, radiographic union was present in 50.0% of single plates and 64.7% in the dual plating group (p= 0.032). However, at 6 months, no significant difference existed (90.0% vs. 94.1%,p= 0.297). Comparing groups at 1.5 and 6 months, Constant-Murley outcome scores were present with no significant difference (p= 0.129,p= 0.054) between single plates and dual plating group. However, at 3 months, significance difference existed. Discussion: Three months after the operation, patients with dual-plate fixation showed good functional recovery. Extra-periosteal dual plating for acute mid-shaft clavicle fractures can be safely considered for the treatment of complex acute mid-shaft clavicle fractures without increasing the risk of nonunion or revision. Conclusions: Open reduction and internal fixation with an extra-periosteal dual plating technique is a reliable option for treatment of acute mid-shaft clavicle fractures, especially in the setting of severely comminuted fractures and in situations where bone quality is questionable and additional fixation is desired.

Materials and methods: Two matched cohorts of 23 matched patients, one with a displaced dorsal rim fracture >2 mm (group 1), and the other without a dorsal rim fracture (group 2) were analysed in this study of volar locking plate fixation for dorsally unstable DRFs. The two cohorts were analysed for differences in wrist function and wrist pain, radiographic parameters and arthritic grades of radiocarpal joints. Displacement of dorsal rim fragments and diameters of the retained articular portions of dorsal rims in group 1 were measured. Results: No significant difference was found between the two groups in overall wrist function or wrist pain. Mean displacement of dorsal rims in group 1 was 3.0 mm and the mean diameter of the retained articular portion of dorsal articular wall was 2.0 mm. No significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of any radiographic parameters or the arthritic grading of radiocarpal joints. Conclusion: A displaced dorsal rim fracture does not appear to affect outcomes adversely after volar locking plate fixation of dorsally displaced DRFs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

There are various fixation options, not presently standardised. Hypothesis: Internal fixation by screws or dorsal locking plate provides good 5-year clinical results in four-corner fusion. Material and method: A single-centre retrospective study included 18 four-corner fusions at a minimum 5 years' follow-up: 8 plate and 10 screw fixations. Endpoints comprised pain, wrist range of motion, grip strength, QuickDASH and PRWE scores, and immobilisation time. Radiographic analysis was performed and complications inventoried. Results: Pain VAS score fell to 1/10 in both groups. Flexion-extension was 56 degrees with screws and 55 degrees with plates. QuickDASH was 20.5 and 4.6 respectively, and PRWE 11 and 9. Grip strength was 16 kg in both groups. The consolidation rate was 85.7% with screws and 57.1% with plates. Eighty percent of patients with screw fixation progressed toward radiolunate osteoarthritis. Four patients required revision surgery: 3 in the screw group and 1 in the plate group. Discussion: There was clear clinical and functional improvement in both groups at a minimum 5 years. Consolidation was better with screw fixation, but with risk of radiolunate osteoarthritis.

In this research, a finite element based investigation was made to compare these two fixation techniques for the fixation of distal tibia fractures from the biomechanics point of view. For this purpose, a 3 mm transverse fracture gap was created at the distal metaphyseal region of tibia and fixed by use of either a nail or a plate. The von Mises stress, interfragmentary movements, and the production of different tissue phenotypes at the fracture site were calculated. Results of this study showed that plating offers more advantageous biomechanical conditions at the fracture site, in which it provides sufficient amount of axial interfragmentary movement and considerable amount of cartilage production, while intramedullary nailing restricts axial movements but causes high magnitude of shear movements. However, nailing is superior to plating from the mechanical point of view and provides earlier weight bearing. In addition, it was shown that by using composite materials, biomechanical behavior of both fixation techniques will be improved through decreasing risk of failure and promoting cartilaginous tissue production.

This swelling may cause significant decrease of the blood flow, so the state of the soft tissue is determinant for the surgical indication and the type of implant. This retrospective study compares the union times in cases of tibial plafond fractures managed with a hybrid external fixation as a definitive procedure versus those managed with a two stage strategy with final plate fixation. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study in a polytrauma referral hospital was performed between 2005 and 2011. Patients with a tibial plafond fracture, managed with a hybrid external fixation as a definitive procedure or managed with a two stage strategy with the final plate fixation were included in the study. Postoperative radiographs were evaluated by two senior surgeons. Fracture healing was defined as callus bridging of one cortex, seen on both lateral and anteroposterior X-ray. The clinical outcome was evaluated by means of 11 points Numerical Rating Scale for pain and The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle score, assessed at the last followup visit. Thirteen patients had been managed with a hybrid external fixation and 18 with a two-stage strategy with the final plate fixation. There were 14 males and 17 females with a mean age of 48 years (range 19u82 years). The mean followup was 24 months (range 24u70 months). Results: The mean time from surgery to weight bearing was 7 6.36 days for the hybrid fixation group and 57.43 15.46 days for the plate fixation group (P 0.0001); and the mean time from fracture to radiological union was 133.82 37.83) and 152.8 72.33 days respectively (P = 0.560). Conclusion: Besides the differences between groups regarding the baseline characteristics of patients, the results of this study suggest that in cases of tibial plafond fractures, the management with a hybrid external fixation as a definitive procedure might involve a faster union than a two-stage management with final plate fixation.

Intermaxillary fixation (IMF) is a founding principle of accurate mandibular fracture repair. Although arch bars are currently the standard in securing IMF, IMF screws have many potential benefits and should therefore not be overlooked. The goals of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of IMF screws in the management of mandibular fractures, describe the technique, and identify those who will benefit from it without compromising the end results. Materials and Methods: Thirty-six consecutive patients with single or multiple displaced fractures of the mandible were treated using screw IMF. Open reduction internal fixation was then accomplished in the usual fashion. Postoperative plain films were used to evaluate fracture reduction and screw placement. Data were collected prospectively from clinical and radiologic evaluations at regular follow-rap appointments. Results: Thirty-five (97.2%) of 36 patients demonstrated normal occlusion at the follow-up examination 6 weeks postoperatively. One case of root fracture and four cases of root impingement by screws were observed at the follow-up examinations. Conclusions: Cortical bone screws offer a reliable alternative to more traditional methods of obtaining IMF in the treatment of mandibular fractures and present many advantages to the surgeon and the patient. Their use may be limited to specific clinical situations and potential consequences, of which the surgeon must be aware. Adequate preoperative planning is therefore essential to maximize successful results.

Hence, in this work, biocomposites made of different compositions of polylactic acid (PLA), nanohydroxyapatite (nHap), and modified chitosan (MCS) were prepared. The prepared biocomposite was subjected to X-ray diffraction, surface morphology, differential scanning calorimetry, contact angle analysis, thermogravimetric, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and mechanical characterisation. The field emission scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis demonstrated that the drawback of non-uniform distribution associated with chitosan (CS) had been overcome with the MCS. The maximum degradation temperature obtained with the biocomposite developed in the present investigation was higher (389 degrees C) than with neat PLA and PLA with chitosan. Thus, the interaction of nHAp with MCS and PLA made the fabricated biocomposites superior in terms of thermal stability. The contact angle study showed an enhancement in the surface wettability property, suggesting that the prepared biocomposites are suitable for cell adhesion. The study found PLA/nHAp/MCS composite to have better modulus and elongation as compared to PLA and PLA/nHAp. Also, the characterisation of the materials showcased better physiochemical properties with PLA/nHAp/MCS biocomposite. Moreover, the DSC results confirmed that no phase separation has occurred in the formed biocomposites. Thus, the developed biocomposites have the potential to be an alternative biodegradable implant material, especially for fabricating bone screws and plates to be used as non-load bearing internal fixation devices.

This injury can be accompanied by a glenoid fracture; however, it is a rare type of complex injury in patients aged under 60 years. Materials and methods A 53-year-old man presented with a three-part fracture-dislocation of the proximal humerus and a severely comminuted glenoid fracture. For the glenohumeral dislocation and proximal humeral fracture, we performed closed reduction using a threaded Steinman pin and fixation with percutaneous cannulated screws. Using arthroscopy, while maintaining humeral traction with the Steinman pin, the intra-articular glenoid fragments were reduced and then fixed with a buttressing headless screw and one suture anchor. After a 6-week immobilization with a shoulder spica cast, rehabilitation was initiated. Results We confirmed bony union of the fracture sites after 6 months post-surgery. The patient showed excellent clinical outcomes with a nearly full range of motion without instability Conclusions We reported a successful outcome for a complex proximal humeral fracture involving the glenoid using closed reduction and fixation for the proximal humeral fracture and arthroscopic reduction and fixation for the comminuted anteroinferior glenoid fracture.

We present a single-centre experience of craniocervical fixation in children under 5 years. Methods A retrospective review of cases that had undergone atlantoaxial (AA) or occipitocervical (OC) fixation aged under 5 years. Fusion was assessed using computerised tomography or flexion extension X-rays. Results Twenty-six children (median age 2.3, range 0.8-4.9 years, 19 under the age of 3) underwent OC (n = 19) or AA (n = 7) fusion between 1999 and 2016. Pathology comprised 17 congenital, five trauma, two tumour and two post-infection cases. Twenty-one patients underwent sublaminar cable fixation with calvarial, autologous bone graft and halo-body orthosis immobilisation. An occipital plate and rods to sublaminar wire construct were used in four cases. A rigid instrumented fixation with occipital plate and C2 pedicle screws was utilised in one case. Follow-up was for a median of 2.8 years (range 0.03-16.3 years). Initial fusion rate was 91%, reaching 100% following two re-operations. Ninety-two per cent of patients were neurologically stable or improved following surgery. Twenty-one patients had a good overall outcome. Two patients had post-operative neurological deteriorations, and four died due to non-procedure related causes. Pin site morbidity secondary to halo use occurred in five cases. Conclusion High fusion rates with good outcomes are achievable using semi-rigid fixation in the under 5-year-olds. Full thickness, autologous calvarial bone graft secured with wire cables and halo external orthosis offers a safe and effective alternative technique when traditional screw instrumentation is not feasible.

One retrospective study for open reduction and supercutaneous fixation of the calcaneus is reported. We prospectively evaluated the use of this method of fixation combined with percutaneous reduction. Materials and methods: Between January 2014 and June 2015, 32 displaced calcaneus fractures in 30 patients were stabilized with percutaneous reduction and super-cutaneous fixation. They were 24 males and six females. The mean age was 37.9 +/- 5.7 years (21-55). All cases were closed. The time to surgery, complications, radiographic alignment, and time to radiographic union were recorded. Clinical results at the final follow-up were assessed by evaluating Bohler's angles for the radiographic alignment, and the system of the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) for the functional outcome. Results: According to the Sanders' classification, two cases were type II, 17 cases were type III and 13 cases were type IV. The preoperative average Bohler's angle was 10.57 degrees +/- 4.8. The postoperative X-ray films demonstrated that the average Bohler's angle improved to 29.07 degrees +/- 5.9 (p < 0.001). At the time of radiologic healing (about 3 months), the plates and screws were removed under general anesthesia. The average follow-up was 13.2 months (11-18). Four cases (type IV) showed mal-union and heel pain. According to (AOFAS) rating, the fine score was 87.1 +/- 17.1 points. Conclusion: Super-cutaneous fixation with percutaneous reduction of calcaneal fracture is an effective method in type II and III and can be effective with type IV but with less favorable results.

At teaching or evaluation sessions in daily practice, frequent discussion arises about postoperative technical assessment. The assessment of correct reduction and DHS fixation using the described methods in the literature may be subject to differences between observers. The aim of this study was to assess the extent of inter- and intraobserver agreement on technique, based on the methods in the literature, in a simulated daily practice setting. Materials and methods The postoperative anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs of 35 randomly selected patients aged 60-90 years were rated twice, 2 months apart, by six surgical observers from three institutions with similar views on reduction and DHS fixation for this fracture type. The radiographs were of sufficient quality for proper assessment. Criteria for reduction and fixation could be rated as either adequate or inadequate. An adequate rating was assigned if in the observers opinion, regardless of likely outcome, technical perfection according to the described methods had been achieved. The kappa statistic was calculated as a measure of agreement. Results Fracture reduction on the AP view approached a good kappa value (0.54). Poor to moderate interobserver agreement was found for fracture reduction on the lateral view and aspects of DHS fixation (kappa 0.10-0.36). Intraobserver agreement was good for five out of six observers for reduction and DHS fixation aspects (kappa 0.51-0.81). Conclusion During routine practice six surgical observers can nearly agree on adequate fracture reduction on the AP view, but do not agree on adequate reduction on the lateral view and adequate DHS fixation on the postoperative radiographs of displaced intracapsular femoral neck fractures.

Study design: Retrospective clinical study. Materials and methods: Medical and radiographic records of cats and small dogs with appendicular fractures treated with LCP were reviewed. Only cases with adequate follow-up to document clinical union and cases for which complications appeared before the clinical union were included. Complications were classified as implant-related complications or other complications. Cases with implant-related complications were compared to cases with non-implant-related complications for differences in signalment (species, age, body weight, multiple fractures), fracture location and type (fractured bone, fracture localization, closed or open fracture), reduction method (open reduction and internal fixation [ORIF] or minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis [MIPO]) and fixation evaluations (implant size, plate bridging ratio, plate span ratio, working length, plate screw density, number of screws and cortices engaged per plate and per main fragment, ratio between screw and bone diameter at the narrowest aspect of the bone, and presence of ancillary fixation). Results: Seventy-five fractures from 63 cats (64 fractures) and 10 dogs (11 fractures) met the inclusion criteria. Eight humeral, 13 radio-ulnar, 26 femoral, and 28 tibio-fibular fractures were treated. Primary repair of the fracture was performed using 2.0 mm and 2.4 mm LCP in 22 and 53 fractures, respectively. Overall and implant-related complications were encountered in 13 and seven of 75 fractures, respectively. Fixation failure was not significantly associated with any aforementioned factor considered in this study, and in particular, there was no significant difference in the occurrence of fixation failure between fractures stabilized with two, or more than two, bicortical locking screws per main fragment. Clinical significance: 2.0 mm and 2.4 mm LCP were used to manage appendicular fractures in cats and small dogs. The overall complication and fixation failure rate were comparable to those reported in previous studies in which various locking plate systems were used.

Evaluation of the syndesmotic-only fixation for Weber-C ankle fractures with syndesmotic injury	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Weber type-C ankle fractures; syndesmotic disruption; syndesmosis-only fixation; functional outcomes	SCREW FIXATION; MAISONNEUVE FRACTURE; STAINLESS-STEEL; FIBULA; CADAVER	Background: With the length of the fibula restored and the syndesmosis reduced anatomically, internal fixation using a plating device may not be necessary for supra-syndesmotic fibular fractures combined with diastasis of inferior tibio-fibular joint. A retrospective observational study was performed in patients who had this injury pattern treated with syndesmosis-only fixation. Materials and Methods: 12 patients who had Weber type-C injury pattern were treated with syndesmosis only fixation. The treatment plan was followed only if the fibular length could be restored and if the syndesmosis could be anatomically reduced. Through a percutaneous or mini-open reduction and clamp stabilization of the syndesmosis, all but one patient had a single tricortical screw fixation across the syndesmosis. Patients were kept non-weight-bearing for 6 weeks, followed by screw removal at an average of 8 weeks. Outcomes were assessed using an objective ankle scoring system (Olerud and Molander scale) and by radiographic assessment of the ankle mortise. Results: At a mean follow-up of 13 months, the functional outcome score was 75. Excellent to good outcomes were noted in 83% of the patients. Ankle mortise was reduced in all cases, and all but one fibular fracture united without loss of fixation. Six patients had more than one malleolar injury, needing either screw or anchor fixations. One patient had late diastasis after removal of the syndesmotic screw and underwent revision surgery with bone grafting of the fibula. This was probably due to early screw removal, before union of the fibular fracture had occurred. Conclusion: We recommend syndesmosis-only fixation as an effective treatment option for a combination of syndesmosis disruption and Weber type-C lateral malleolar fractures.

Prospective blind comparative clinical study of two point fixation of zygomatic complex fracture using wire and mini plates	HEAD & FACE MEDICINE			English	Article						Zygomatic maxillary complex (ZMC); Internal fixation; Wire osteosynthesis; Mini plate osteosynthesis; Comparison of fixation	CLASSIFICATION; ARCH	Background: The zygomatic maxillary complex (ZMC) fractures are one of the most frequent injuries of the facial skeleton due to its position and facial contour. Assaults, road traffic accidents and falls are the principal etiologic factors that may cause fractures of zygomatic bone. The different fixation methods are applied to treat the zygomatic bone fractures, with many more classifications which have been described in the literature for the ease of management. The type of the fracture, its severity and associated facial fractures usually interferes the treatment modality. Purpose of study: The aim of this paper is to show the results of 18yrs prospective blind comparative study using wire and plate osteosynthesis which needed open reduction and internal fixation involving Type II to Type IV Spissel and Schroll ZMC fractures. Materials and methods: Total 80 cases included in the study out of 1780 ZMC cases which were treated using wire and plate osteosynthesis over a period of 18 yrs, involving only Type II to Type IV Spissel and Schroll ZMC fractures. Other types excluded from study to prevent observer bias. All the fixations carried out through Standard Dingman's incision using stainless steel 26 gauze wire and titanium 1.5 mm mini plate system under general anesthesia by single maxillofacial surgeon and evaluated by another maxillofacial surgeon who is blinded for surgical procedure after 2 and 4 wks of follow-up for facial symmetry, wound healing, functional assessment (mouth opening, diplopia), and sensory disturbance. All the data tabulated in Excel software (Microsoft) for statistical analysis. P-value calculated to know the Significance of treatment modality in all aspects. Results: Result shows no significant p-values indicating both the operating techniques are equally efficient in the surgical management of ZMC fracture. Conclusion: Osteosynthesis by mini plates is simple, logical and effective treatment compared to wire osteosynthesis in regard to stability of fracture fragments. Wire osteosynthesis will be helpful in emergency surgeries or where the mini plates are not available. Even though the wire osteosynthesis is economical compared to mini plate fixation; but the time and skill is required for fixation of wires.

The use of a blade plate affords axial and rotational stability and the potential for compression. Compromised anterior soft tissue is avoided, and there is ample posterior soft tissue coverage of hardware and bone graft material. With the patient prone, all planes of ankle and foot alignment may be easily viewed clinically and with fluoroscopy, and access to the posterior iliac crest allows for a large volume of bone graft or bone marrow aspirate. In addition, access to the distal tibia, talus, and calcaneus is achieved with this incision, allowing for rigid fixation of the tibiotalar or TTC joints as well as enabling for removal of TAA implants.

The past ten years have witnessed tremendous efforts in utilizing BiOCl as a versatile catalysts for photocatalytic applications, including pollutant removal, water splitting, CO2 reduction, N-2\ fixation and organic transformation. Remarkably, photocatalytic performance of BiOCl shows high dependency on its exposed crystal facets. In this brief review, we highlight the recent progress on the photocatalysis of different exposed crystal facets of BiOCl, focusing on the facet-dependent internal electric field manipulation, sensitization, carbon doping, and plasmonic hot carriers utilization. Understanding of the facet-dependent photocatalysis of BiOCl will offer new guidelines for the rational design of novel catalysts.

Osteobiologics are materials/agents that can promote fracture healing and enhance fracture stability. Given the challenges presented by osteoporotic fractures, they seem ideally suited to potentially benefit from the application of osteobiologics. Despite this, limited clinical investigation into the use of osteobiologics in the management of osteoporotic fractures has been performed.

Accurate reduction and stable fixation are important in the treatment of frontal sinus fracture. Traditional approaches to the reduction of an isolated anterior table fracture include the coronal incision, the bilateral brow incision, an endoscopic brow lift with an incision either directly over the fracture or in the brow, and delayed repair with a camouflaging implant. In our experience, autogenous bone graft is considered to be the best grafting material. It has the less short-term or long-term complications, and the donor site morbidity is insignificant.

A biomechanical analysis	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Biomechanics; Open-book fracture; Cannulated screw; Minimally invasive fixation	INTERNAL-FIXATION; SYMPHYSIS PUBIS; OPEN REDUCTION; DIASTASIS; IMPLANT; TRAUMA; PELVIS; SYSTEM; HERNIA	Objectives: The current biomechanical work compares the symphyseal and sacroiliac stability obtained with two systems of bone osteosynthesis. The two methods of fixation compared were the 6-hole suprapubic non-locked plate and pubic fixation with two cannulated screws, a novel technique that can be applied percutaneously in the clinical practice. The aim of this study was to examine the validity of the use of two-cannulated-screws osteosynthesis in order to minimize the secondary effects of open fixation, especially in patients in whom an open reduction is contraindicated. Materials and methods: A biomechanical study was designed in 9 fresh, human pelvis specimens, simulating an AO B1.1 type injury, using both fixation systems sequentially in each specimen. In both parts of the test, the specimens were subjected to an axial load of 300N. Displacements and rotations between the different pelvic elements were studied by means of a discrete set of points. The absence of differences between the two systems has been set as the null hypothesis. Results: There were significant differences in favor of the cross-cannulated screws in most of the displacements measured at the pubic symphysis and sacroiliac joint. Conclusions: Fixation of the AO B1.1 type fractures with cross cannulated screws restores the biomechanical behavior of the pubic symphysis, obtaining better stability than fixation with the 6-hole non-locked plate. To date, no comparative, biomechanical studies have been conducted with these two systems of osteosynthesis. This study demonstrates that cross-cannulated screws fixation of the pubic symphysis in AO B1.1 pelvic fractures should be considered as an alternative to the conventional plating system.

Thus, the need for fracture fixation implant design that provides sufficient stability at the fracture site to avoid potential stress shielding that may be associated with modulus mismatch is paramount. This potential issue can be addressed efficiently by fabricating stiffness-graded (compositionally graded) titanium alloys with low elastic modulus (or stiffness) at the ends, comparable to the bone modulus; and higher elastic modulus at the center, close to the site of the fracture. Additive manufacturing processes such as laser engineered net shaping (LENS (TM)), a near-net shape processing technology, has the potential to fabricate functionally graded biomedical implants. This study focuses on the development of a novel LENS (TM) deposited, compositionally and functionally graded Ti-based metallic plate for potential bone fixation. The gradation has been achieved between a low modulus Ti-35Nb-15Zr (wt%) alloy and the higher modulus, commercially pure Ti near the center of the plate. Site-specific microstructure and mechanical properties along the compositional gradient are presented.	[Lima, D. D.; Mantri, S. A.; Mikler, C. V.; Contieri, R.; Yannetta, C.

Materials and Methods: After sagittal split osteotomy, 10-mm advancement was performed in the first group and 10-mm advancement and 10-degree counterclockwise rotation were performed in the second group. One miniplate (M-1), two-miniplate (M-2), one miniplate and a bicortical screw (H), L-shaped bicortical screw (B-1), and inverted L-shaped bicortical screw (B-2) systems were placed. Totally, 120 N force was applied to the models at a 45-degree angle from the lower edge of the symphysis. Results: The highest values on fixation were seen with miniplate, while the mean values were obtained with bicortical screw system. The highest values on bone were achieved using bicortical screws. One miniplate (M-1) showed both the highest and mean displacement. The highest values in counterclockwise-rotated models increased in all parameters, compared to non-rotated models. Conclusion: In cases in which passive alignment between segments and adequate bone contact are ensured, inverted L-shaped bicortical screw, two-miniplate, or hybrid systems are recommended.

Strength of Titanium Intramedullary Implant versus Miniplate Fixation of Mandibular Condyle Fractures	OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY			English	Article						intramedullary fixation; mandible; mandible fracture; mandibular condyle; fracture; implant	BIOMECHANICAL EVALUATION; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; PLATE; MODEL	Objective. To test the strength of internal fixation of mandibular condyle fractures repaired with titanium miniplates versus titanium intramedullary implants. Study Design. Prospective laboratory experimentation in urethane mandible models and human cadaveric mandibles. Setting. Materials testing laboratory at an academic medical center. Methods. Osteotomies of the mandibular condyle were created in 40 urethane hemimandible models and 24 human cadaveric specimens. Half of the samples in each group were repaired with traditional miniplates, and the other half were repaired with intramedullary titanium implants. Anteroposterior and mediolateral loads were applied to the samples, and the displacement was measured with reference to the applied force. Results. Titanium intramedullary implants demonstrated statistically significant improved strength and stiffness versus miniplates in the urethane model experimental groups. Despite frequent plastic deformation and mechanical failures of the miniplates, a 1.6-mm-diameter titanium intramedullary pin did not mechanically fail in any of the cases. Intramedullary implantation failures were due to secondary fracture of the adjacent cortical bone or experimental design limitations including rotation of the smooth pin implant. Conclusion. Mechanical implant failures that were encountered with miniplate fixation were not seen with titanium intramedullary implants. These intramedullary implants provide stronger and more rigid fixation of mandibular condyle fractures than miniplates in this in vitro model.

Longitudinal recovery following distal radial fractures managed with volar plate fixation	BONE & JOINT JOURNAL			English	Article							DORSALLY DISPLACED FRACTURES; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; BRIDGING EXTERNAL FIXATION; PRONATOR QUADRATUS REPAIR; OPEN REDUCTION; LOCKING-PLATE; INTERNAL-FIXATION; FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES; PERCUTANEOUS FIXATION; INTRAMEDULLARY NAIL	Aims To synthesise the literature and perform a meta-analysis detailing the longitudinal recovery in the first two years following a distal radius fracture (DRF) managed with volar plate fixation. Materials and Methods Three databases were searched to identify relevant articles. Following eligibility screening and quality assessment, data were extracted and outcomes were assimilated at the postoperative time points of interest. A state-of-the-art longitudinal mixed-effects meta-analysis model was employed to analyse the data. Results The search identified 5698 articles, of which 46 study reports met the selection criteria. High levels of disability and impairment were reported in the immediate post-operative period with subsequently a rapid initial improvement followed by more gradual improvement for up to one year. The results highlight that the period associated with the greatest physical recovery is in the first three months and suggest that the endpoint of treatment outcomes is best measured at one year post-surgery. Conclusion Clinically meaningful improvements in outcomes can be expected for 12 months, after which progress plateaus and reaches normal values. This paper adopted a novel approach to meta-analyses in that the research question was of a longitudinal nature, which required a unique method of statistical analysis.	[Graham, P. L.; Moloney, N.

It is thus valuable to evaluate the quality of unions in these cases. The aim of this study was radiological comparison of magnesium versus titanium open reduction and rigid fixations in the mandible condylar head. Thirty-one patients were treated for fractures of the mandibular head with magnesium WE43 alloy headless compression screws (diameter 2.3 mm) and, as a reference group, 29 patients were included with similar construction titanium screws (diameter 1.8 mm). The 12-month results of the treatment were evaluated by the texture analysis of CT. Near similar treatment results were found with magnesium screws in traditional titanium fixation. Magnesium screws result in a higher density of the bone structure in the mandibular head. Conclusions: The quantitative evaluation of bone union after surgical treatment of mandibular head fracture with magnesium compression headless screws indicates that stable consolidation was achieved. Undoubtedly, the resorption process of the screws was found to be incomplete after 12 months, evidenced by a marked densification of the bone structure at the fracture site.

Various supplemental fixations can be co-applied with OLIF, increasing OLIF stability and reducing complications. However, it is unclear whether osteoporosis affects the success of supplemental fixations; therefore, this study analyzed the effects of osteoporosis on various supplemental fixations co-applied with OLIF. Methods We developed and validated an L3-S1 finite element (FE) model; we assigned different material properties to each component and established models of the osteoporotic and normal bone lumbar spine. We explored the outcomes of OLIF combined with each of five supplemental fixations: standalone OLIF; OLIF with lateral plate fixation (OLIF + LPF); OLIF with translaminar facet joint fixation and unilateral pedicle screw fixation (OLIF + TFJF + UPSF); OLIF with unilateral pedicle screw fixation (OLIF + UPSF); and OLIF with bilateral pedicle screw fixation (OLIF + BPSF). Under the various working conditions, we calculated the ranges of motion (ROMs) of the normal bone and osteoporosis models, the maximum Mises stresses of the fixation instruments (MMSFIs), and the average Mises stresses on cancellous bone (AMSCBs). Results Compared with the normal bone OLIF model, no demonstrable change in any segmental ROM was apparent. The MMSFIs increased in all five osteoporotic OLIF models. In the OLIF + TFJF + UPSF model, the MMSFIs increased sharply in forward flexion and extension. The stress changes of the OLIF + UPSF, OLIF + BPSF, and OLIF + TFJF + UPSF models were similar; all stresses trended upward. The AMSCBs decreased in all five osteoporotic OLIF models during flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation. The average stress change of cancellous bone was most obvious under extension. The AMSCBs of the five OLIF models decreased by 14%, 23.44%, 21.97%, 40.56%, and 22.44% respectively. Conclusions For some supplemental fixations, the AMSCBs were all reduced and the MMSFIs were all increased in the osteoporotic model, compared with the OLIF model of normal bone. Therefore, the biomechanical performance of an osteoporotic model may be inferior to the biomechanical performance of a normal model for the same fixation method; in some instances, it may increase the risks of fracture and internal fixation failure.

J	Satish, BRJ; Ranganadham, AV; Ramalingam, K; Tripathy, SK				Satish, Bhava R. J.; Ranganadham, Atmakuri V.; Ramalingam, Karruppasamy; Tripathy, Sujit Kumar			Four quadrant parallel peripheral screw fixation for displaced femoral neck fractures in elderly patients	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Femoral neck fracture; osteosynthesis; four quadrant parallel screw fixation	TOTAL HIP-REPLACEMENT; INTERNAL-FIXATION; INTRACAPSULAR FRACTURES; OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT; ARTHROPLASTY	Background: The treatment options for displaced femoral neck fracture in elderly are screw fixation, hemiarthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty based primarily on age of the patient. The issues in screw fixation are ideal patient selection, optimal number of screws, optimal screw configuration and positioning inside the head and neck of femur. The problems of screw fixation may be loss of fixation, joint penetration, avascular necrosis of femoral head, nonunion, prolonged rehabilitation period and the need for second surgery in failed cases. We hereby present results of a modified screw fixation technique in femoral neck fractures in patients >= 50 years of age. Materials and Methods: Patients >= 50 years of age (range 50-73 years) who sustained displaced femoral neck fracture and fulfilled the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this prospective study. They were treated with closed reduction under image intensifier control and cannulated cancellous screw fixation. Accurate anatomical reduction was not aimed and a cross sectional contact area of >75% without varus was accepted as good reduction. Four screws were positioned in four quadrants of femoral head and neck, as parallel and as peripheral as possible. Radiological and functional results were evaluated periodically. Sixty four patients who could complete a minimum followup of two years were analyzed. Results: Radiologically, all fractures healed after mean duration of 10 weeks (range 8-12 weeks). There was no avascular necrosis. Nonanatomical healing was observed in 45 cases (70%). All patients except one had excellent functional outcome and could do cross-legged sitting and squatting. Chondrolysis with progressive head resorption was seen in one case, which was converted to total hip arthroplasty. Conclusion: Closed reduction and cannulated cancellous screw fixation gives satisfactory functional results in large group of elderly patients. The four quadrant parallel peripheral (FQPP) screw fixation technique gives good stability, allows controlled collapse, avoids fixation failure and achieves predictable bone healing in displaced femoral neck fracture in patients >= 50 years of age.

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 12 patients with unstable atlas fractures surgically treated using C1 lateral mass screws, rods, and transverse connector constructs. Nine lateral mass fractures with transverse atlantal ligament (TAL) avulsion injury and three 4-part fractures with TAL injury (two avulsion injuries, one TAL substance tear) were treated. Radiologic outcomes included the anterior atlantodental interval (AADI) in flexion and extension cervical spine lateral radiographs at 6 months and 1 year after treatment. CT was also performed to visualize bony healing of the atlas at 6 months and 1 year. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores for neck pain, Neck Disability Index (NDI) values, and cervical range of motion (flexion, extension, and rotation) were recorded at 6 months after surgery. Results: The mean postoperative extension and flexion AADIs were 3.79 +/- 1.56 (mean +/- SD) and 3.13 +/- 1.01 mm, respectively. Then mean AADI was 3.42 +/- 1.34 and 3.33 +/- 1.24 mm at 6 months and 1 year after surgery, respectively. At 1 year after surgery, 11 patients showed bony healing of the atlas on CT images. Only one patient underwent revision surgery 8 months after primary surgery due to nonunion and instability findings. The mean VAS score for neck pain was 0.92 +/- 0.99, and the mean NDI value was 8.08 +/- 5.70. Conclusion: C1 motion-preserving direct internal fixation technique results in good reduction and stabilization of unstable atlas fractures. This technique allows for the preservation of craniocervical and atlantoaxial motion.

Tibia-pro-fibula screws that extend from the fibula into the distal tibial metaphysis provide additional purchase. The purpose of this study was to investigate if purchase of these screws can be enhanced further by injecting calcium sulfate and calcium phosphate composite graft into the drill holes prior to insertion of the screws. Materials and Methods: Bone density was quantified using a DEXA scan in paired cadaver legs. One leg from each pair was randomly selected for injection of composite graft into the screw holes before insertion of the screws. Two screws were inserted through the fibula into the distal tibial metaphysis in each leg, at the level of the syndesmosis under fluoroscopy in a standardized fashion in an NITS machine. Results: After testing 4 pairs of cadaver legs, a statistically significant difference was noted in displacement (p = 0.018 distal, p = 0.0093 proximal), failure load, (p = 0.0185 distal, p = 0.0238 proximal), and failure energy (p = 0.0071 distal, p = 0.0115 proximal) between augmented and non-augmented screws, with the augmented screws being considerably stronger. Conclusion: Screws augmented with composite graft provide significantly greater purchase in an osteoporotic fibular fracture model. Clinical relevance: Composite graft augmented screws inserted into the distal tibia from the fibula may enhance the stability of internal fixation of an osteoporotic ankle fracture. This may enable earlier weightbearing and return to function which is important in elderly patients.

Open Reduction Internal Fixation Versus Primary Arthrodesis for Lisfranc Injuries: A Prospective Randomized Study	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Lisfranc; Arthrodesis; Open Reduction Internal Fixation; Functional Outcomes; Secondary Surgery; Tarsometatarsal Joint	FUNCTION ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE; TARSOMETATARSAL JOINTS; FRACTURE-DISLOCATIONS	Background: Dislocations and fracture-dislocations involving the tarsometatarsal joint are a relatively common injury. These injuries are associated with long-term disability from subsequent painful osteoarthritis and residual deformity. This study evaluated whether performing a primary arthrodesis (PA) resulted in improved functional outcome and fewer subsequent surgeries as compared to primary open reduction and internal fixation (PORIF). Materials and Methods: Forty patients with acute tarsometatarsal joint fractures or fracture dislocations were prospectively randomized to undergo either PORIF or PA. Clinical and radiographic examination, in addition to Short Form-36 (SF-36) and Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA) questionnaires, were evaluated at intervals of 3, 6, 12, and 24 months following surgery in 32 patients. A patient satisfaction phone survey was also performed. Results: The rate of planned and unplanned secondary surgeries, including hardware removal and salvage arthrodesis, between ORIF and PA groups, 78.6% vs. 16.7% was significantly different. No statistically significant differences were found with physical functioning for the PORIF or PA groups with regard to SF-36 or SMFA scores at any followup time interval. However, time from injury had a significant effect with impaired functioning at three months compared to all future intervals. No difference in satisfaction rates were found between PORIF and PA at an average of 53 months in a phone survey. Conclusion: PA of tarsometatarsal joint injuries resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of followup surgical procedures if hardware removal is routinely performed with no significant difference in SF-36 and SMFA outcome scores when compared to PORIF.

As its outstanding feature, it is the only Schanz screw and rod system at present that combines angular stability, perforation/fenestration of the screws for cement-augmentation, a variable screw length, and a large screw diameter.Materials and methodsRetrospective investigation of 134 pelvic ring fractures treated in 2012-2013. Twenty-five patients obtained the abovementioned implant. Besides baseline characteristics of the included patients and the surgical procedure, a clinical/radiological follow-up of sixmonths was analyzed.ResultsDividing the collective into two groups, I high-energy trauma and II fragility fracture of the pelvis, the following results were recorded: group I: ten patients, six male, age 48.419.7years. Mean ISS 4122.5, fracture classification: AO/OTA type 61 B-1/C-1/C-3=1/5/4. Operative treatment: three transiliac internal fixator, seven iliolumbar fixation, one implant was cement-augmented. Group II: 15 patients, 14 female, age 77.5 +/- 10.1years. Fracture classification according to Rommens: FFPII/(III)/(IV)=6/1/8. Operative treatment: eight transiliac internal fixator, seven iliolumbar fixation, 14 implants were cement-augmented. Overall surgical side complications: 16%. Radiological examination: correct positioning of all ilium screws. Follow-up after sixmonth (16 patients): all showed fracture consolidation. One ilium screw was broken close to the connecting clamp.Conclusion The investigated Schanz screw rod system is a suitable implant to broaden the established procedures to stabilize dorsal pelvic ring fractures.Trial registration The study is registered at the Clinical Trial Registry University of Regensburg (Number Z-2017-0878-3).

There is considerable variation in opinion regarding the mode of operative treatment of these injuries, with some studies preferring primary arthrodesis over traditional open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). We aim to assess the clinical and radiological outcomes of the patients treated with ORIF in our unit. Materials and Methods This is a retrospective study, in which all 27 consecutive patients treated with ORIF between June 2013 and October 2018 by one surgeon were included with an average followup of 2.4 years. All patients underwent ORIF with joint-sparing surgery by a dorsal bridging plate (DBP) for the second and third tarsometatarsal (TMT) joint, and the first TMT joint was fixed with transarticular screws. Patients had clinical examination and radiological assessment and completed American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) midfoot score and Foot Function Index (FFI) questionnaires. Results Our early results of 22 patients (5 lost to followup) showed that 16 (72%) patients were pain free, walking normally without aids, and wearing normal shoes and 68% were able to run or play sports. The mean AOFAS midfoot score was 78.1 (63-100) and the average FFI was 19.5 (0.6-34). Radiological assessment confirmed that only three patients had progression to posttraumatic arthritis at the TMT joints though only one of these was clinically symptomatic. Conclusion Good clinical and radiological outcomes can be achieved by ORIF in lisfranc injuries with joint-sparing surgery using DBP.

JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							3RD MOLAR SURGERY; OF-THE-LITERATURE; CLINICAL-TRIAL; MANAGEMENT; CORTICOSTEROIDS; COMPLICATIONS; METAANALYSIS; EXTRACTION; INJURIES; EFFICACY	Purpose: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the application of elastic therapeutic tape (Kinesio Tape [KT]) prevents or decreases swelling, pain, and trismus after open reduction and internal fixation of mandibular fracture, thus improving patients' postoperative morbidity. Materials and Methods: To address the research purpose, the investigators designed and implemented an open-label, monocentric, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial. Patients were prospectively assigned for treatment of unilateral mandibular fractures and randomly allocated to receive treatment with or without KT application. KT was applied directly after surgery and maintained for 5 days postoperatively. Facial swelling was quantified using a 5-line measurement at 6 specific time points. Pain score was assessed using a 10-level visual analog scale; mouth opening was measured. In addition, all patients were asked to evaluate overall satisfaction and swelling (2 groups) and the effect of the tape on movement and comfort (KT group only). Results: The study included 26 patients (11 female and 15 male; mean age, 43 yr; standard deviation, 18.5 yr). Application of KT after surgery for mandibular fracture had a statistically significant influence on tissue reaction and swelling, decreasing the incidence of swelling and turgidity by more than 60% during the first 2 days after surgery. Although KT had no significant influence on pain control, patients in the KT group perceived significantly lower morbidity. Conclusion: The present results showed that KT after open reduction and internal fixation of mandibular fracture is a promising, simple, less traumatic, and economical approach for managing postoperative swelling that is free from systemic adverse reactions, thus improving patients' quality of life.

Immediate internal fixation in open ankle fractures is widely reported to produce good results, with a very low infection rate. However, there are few reports in the literature discussing distinct features of open ankle fractures. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore the injury features of such fractures and the operative technique; pilon fractures were excluded. Materials and Methods: Ninety-six patients with open ankle fractures underwent surgery between August 2001 and March 2008. Ninety-two patients were followed for an average of 35 (range, 14 to 66) months. Intravenous antibiotics were initiated in the emergency room, and wounds were copiously irrigated and thoroughly debrided in the operating room as soon as possible. Based on the fracture's classification, the extent of comminution, and the wound condition, a rational sequence of treatment for each malleolar fracture was determined. Reduction and internal fixation of the fractures were performed in turn. Results: Primary wound healing was achieved in 65 patients. Superficial skin necrosis was seen in 19 patients, four patients had delayed wound healing and two had superficial infections. One diabetic patient developed a deep infection. The average time of fracture healing was 13 weeks. The mean AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score was 90.4 (range, 59 to 100). Conclusions: Compared with closed ankle fractures, open ankle fractures have some unique injury features, and correspondingly require special treatment methods with respect to soft-tissue handling, restoration of large posterior malleolar fractures, the reconstruction sequence of malleolar fractures, and the management of distal tibiotibular syndesmotic diastasis.

According to the literature, dynamisation happens in about 15-25% of cases, but it cannot be predicted which patient or fracture will need dynamisation. The aim of this study is to present a new selfdynamisable implant and a minimally invasive method for the internal fixation of different femoral fractures. Materials and methods The study was conducted between 2000 and 2008 and included 849 patients with 871 fractures receiving the selfdynamisable internal fixator (SIF) for proximal, diaphyseal and distal femur fractures. Results The average operative time was 44 min (23-119 min) and the average fluoroscopy time was 12 s (6-92 s), while the average blood loss was 90 ml (60-250 ml) when a minimally invasive technique was used. None of the patients developed complications during the intra-operative period. Complete follow-up was available in 726 patients with 738 fractures. The healing time was 3.9 months (3-9 months). Healing was achieved in 99.1% of patients. Superficial infection developed in seven fixations (0.9%), while deep infection developed in four patients (0.5%). Screw-breaking occurred within 6-18 weeks in 19 fixations (2.6%). Cut-out phenomenon happened in 24 cases. Spontaneous axial dynamisation was observed in 71 (23.8%) out of 738 fractures, being 5 mm on average (2-12 mm). Conclusion The SIF is an effective method for the treatment of femoral fractures. This method is particularly valuable in the treatment of comminuted fractures with regard to minimally invasive surgery.

ORIF of Distal Humerus Fractures with Modern Pre-contoured Implants is Still Associated with a High Rate of Complications	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Distal humerus fracture; Open reduction internal fixation; Complication	INTRAARTICULAR FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; HETEROTOPIC OSSIFICATION; INTERCONDYLAR FRACTURES; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; OPEN REDUCTION; OPERATIVE TREATMENT; C FRACTURES; ULNAR NERVE; PLATE	Background The purpose of this study was to identify complications after operative treatment of distal humerus fractures with anatomic, pre-contoured, locking distal humeral plates. We hypothesized that these fractures have high complication rates despite the use of these modern implants. Materials and Methods Between 2010 and 2018, 43 adult patients with a distal humerus fracture underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) at a Level I trauma center. Pre-operative variables, including medical comorbidities, mechanism of injury, open or closed fracture, AO/OTA fracture classification (Type A, B, or C), and nerve palsy, were recorded. Intra-operative variables including surgical approach, ulnar nerve transposition, and plate configuration were recorded. Anatomic, pre-contoured, locking distal humeral plates were used in all patients. Various plating systems were used based on surgeon preference and fracture pattern. Post-operative complications including infection, nonunion, malunion, painful implants, nerve palsy, heterotopic ossification, stiffness, and post-traumatic arthritis were recorded. Results Most fractures were Type C (53%). The posterior olecranon osteotomy approach (51%) and parallel plate configuration (42%) were used in most cases. At a mean follow-up of 15 months, the complication rate was 61% (26/43 patients). Among all patients, 49% (21/43 patients) required a reoperation. Elbow stiffness (19%) was the most common complication followed by nerve palsy (16%). There were four fracture nonunions (9%), deep infections (9%), painful implants (9%), post-traumatic arthritis (9%), and heterotopic ossification (9%). Conclusions Distal humerus fractures treated with ORIF utilizing anatomic, pre-contoured, locking distal humeral plates have a high complication rate, with many requiring reoperation.

Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty for acute proximal humeral fracture: comparison to open reduction-internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty	JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY			English	Article						Shoulder arthroplasty; reverse shoulder arthroplasty; hemiarthroplasty; proximal humeral fracture; shoulder fracture; open reduction and internal fixation	SURGICAL-TREATMENT; 4-PART FRACTURES; FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; PROSTHESIS; MULTICENTER; MANAGEMENT; 3-PART; HEAD; CUFF	Background: Significant controversy surrounds optimal treatment of displaced 4-part proximal humeral fractures. Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) has recently been proposed as an alternative to hemiarthroplasty (HA) and open reduction-internal fixation (ORIF). Several authors have questioned the additional implant cost for RTSA. The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes and cost of RTSA, HA, and ORIF. Materials and methods: We prospectively evaluated patients who underwent RTSA for displaced 3- and 4-part proximal humeral fractures and then retrospectively developed age-and sex-matched control groups with 3- and 4-part proximal humeral fractures who underwent HA and ORIF. Range of motion including active forward elevation and external rotation and time to achieve active forward elevation >90 degrees were recorded. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), Short-Form 12-item (SF-12), and Simple Shoulder Test (SST) scores were recorded. In addition, treatment cost was assessed by Medicare data and implant list prices. Results: This study enrolled 27 patients; 9 underwent RTSA, 9 HA, and 9 ORIF. Minimum follow-up was 1 year. No significant differences were seen in SST, ASES, or SF-12 scores. Significantly more patients achieved >90 degrees of active forward elevation after RTSA (P=.012). RTSA provided significant cost savings to Medicare compared with HA and ORIF (P=.002.) Conclusion: In this case-control study, RTSA appears to provide superior range of motion earlier and more predictably than HA and ORIF, with significant cost savings to Medicare.

J	Miles, BA; Potter, JK; Ellis, E				Miles, BA; Potter, JK; Ellis, E			The efficacy of postoperative antibiotic regimens in the open treatment of mandibular fractures: A prospective randomized trial	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							PROPHYLAXIS; MANAGEMENT	Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the necessity and/or effectiveness of postoperative antibiotics in the treatment of mandible fractures. Materials and Methods: This study is a prospective, randomized trial composed of patients who presented for operative treatment of open mandibular fractures and subsequently underwent open reduction and internal fixation at 1 institution. Mandibular fractures treated by an intraoral and/or extraoral open reduction with internal fixation were included in this study. The patients were randomly divided into 2 groups based on whether or not they received postoperative antibiotics. Both groups received preoperative antibiotics of various regimens as well as intraoperative antibiotics on the day of surgery. Group Ab patients received 2.4 mIU of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine, or if allergic, a 5-to 7-day regimen of oral clindamycin. Group non-Ab patients received no antibiotics postoperatively. Patients followed between 5 and 8 weeks were included in the data set. Results: A total of 291 patients were enrolled in the study, of which 181 patients met the inclusion criteria. Group Ab included 81 and group non-Ab 100 patients. Twenty-two patients had evidence of infection noted within the 8-week follow-up period. There were 8 infections in group Ab and 14 infections in group non-Ab. Statistical analysis with the Pearson Chi-square and Student's t test showed no statistically significant difference (P =.399) between groups Ab and non-Ab. Conclusion: Thus study could not prove any statistically significant benefit to the administration of postoperative antibiotics in patients undergoing open reduction and internal fixation of mandibular fractures.

Pediat Craniocervical Soc	Comparison of Fusion Rates Based on Graft Material Following Occipitocervical and Atlantoaxial Arthrodesis in Adults and Children	OPERATIVE NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Occipitocervical fusion; Atlantoaxial fusion; Claims data; Administrative data; Craniocervical junction	TRANSARTICULAR SCREW FIXATION; RIGID INTERNAL-FIXATION; SURGICAL INDICATIONS; PEDIATRIC-PATIENTS; CLINICAL ARTICLE; COMPLICATIONS; ALLOGRAFT; SURGERY; COST; BONE	BACKGROUND: Fusion rates following rigid internal instrumentation for occipitocervical and atlantoaxial instability approach 100% in many reports. Based on this success and the morbidity that can be associated with obtaining autograftfor fusion, surgeons increasingly select alternative graft materials. OBJECTIVE: To examine fusion failure using various graft materials in a retrospective observational study. METHODS: Insurance claims databases (Truven Health MarketScan (R) [Truven Health Analytics, Ann Arbor, Michigan] and IMS Health Lifelink/PHARMetrics [IMS Health, Danbury, Connecticut]) were used to identify patients with CPT codes 22590 and 22595. Patients were divided by age (>= 18 yr = adult) and arthrodesis code, establishing 4 populations. Each population was further separated by graft code: group 1 = 20938 (structural autograft); group 2 = 20931 (structural allograft); group 3 = other graft code (nonstructural); group 4 = no graft code. Fusion failure was assigned when >= 1 predetermined codes presented in the record >= 90 d following the last surgical procedure. RESULTS: Of 522 patients identified, 419 were adult and 103 were pediatric. Fusion failure occurred in 10.9% (57/522) of the population. There was no statistically significant difference in fusion failure based on graft material. Fusion failure occurred in 18.9% of pediatric occipitocervical fusions, but in 9.2% to 11.1% in the other groups. CONCLUSION: Administrative data regarding patients who underwent instrumented occipitocervical or atlantoaxial arthrodesis do not demonstrate differences in fusion rates based on the graft material selected. When compared to many contemporary primary datasets, fusion failure was more frequent; however, several recent studies have shown higher failure rates than previously reported. This may be influenced by broad patient selection and fusion failure criteria that were selected in order to maximize the generalizability of the findings.

The aim of this study was to compare an alternative fixation technique with suture-button devices and anterior plate fixation in partially stable open-book injuries. Material and Methods: We acquired 16 human fresh frozen anatomic pelvic specimens. The sacrospinous, sacrotuberous, and anterior sacroiliac ligaments were bilaterally released, and the pubic symphysis tran-sected to simulate a partially stable open-book (AO/OTA 61-B3.1) injury. The specimens were randomly assigned to the two fixation groups. In the first group two suture-button devices were placed in a criss-crossed position through the symphysis. In second group a six-hole plate with standard 3.5 unlocked bicortical screws was used for fixation. Biomechanical testing was performed on a servo-hydraulic ap-paratus simulating bilateral stance, as described by Hearn and Varga. Cyclic compression loading with a progressively increasing peak load (0.5 N/cycle) was applied until failure. The failure mode, the load and the number of cycles at failure and the proximal and distal distance of the symphysis during testing were compared. Results: There was no implant failure in either of the two groups. Failures occurred in nine pelvises (56.2%) at the fixation between the sacrum and the mounting jig and in seven pelvises (43.8%) in the sacroiliac joint. Neither the ultimate load nor the number of cycles at failure differed between the surgical techniques ( p = 0.772; p = 0.788, respectively). In the suture button group the mean ultimate load was 874.5 N and the number of cycles at failure was 1907.9. In the plate group values were 826.1 N and 1805.6 cycles, respectively. No significant differences at proximal and distal diastasis of the symphysis were monitored during the whole loading process. Conclusion: The fixation with suture button implants showed comparable results to anterior plate fixation in open-book injuries of the pelvis. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of the current study was to assess metallosis following ORIF using distal fibular locking plates to treat distal fibular fractures. Materials and methods 69 patients who underwent surgery using locking compression plates to treat lateral malleolar fractures, with a minimum 1-year follow-up period and subsequent hardware removal were enrolled in our study. We divided the patients into 2 groups, to compare the complications and demographics: 38 patients, treated with ZPLP plate; 31 patients, treated with other plates. Results During 1 year of postoperative follow-up, 20 complications developed: 6 superficial infections at the operative site, 1 case of nonunion, 3 cases of osteitis, 4 cases of hypaesthesia, 2 cases of peripheral neuropathy, and 4 cases of metallosis. No statistical difference was found in the rate of complications when comparing the treatment groups (Mann-Whitney U test, p < .05) except for metallosis. All 4 patients who developed metallosis were treated using a ZPLP plate, and metallosis did not develop at all in patients who underwent surgery using other plates. Conclusion In our study, metallosis developed more than was previously known, particularly after using LCPs to treat lateral malleolar fractures. Our findings and those in recent publications support the possibility that metallosis can occur not only in patients with arthroplasties, but also in patients with open reduction and internal fixation with LCPs. Surgeons should be aware of such risk of metallosis and be careful to select proper plates for internal fixation.

The various procedures such as open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), proximal row carpectomy, lunate excision, and wrist arthrodesis have been advocated. The aim of our study was to evaluate the functional outcome of neglected perilunate dislocations managed by ORIF. Materials and Methods: Over a period of 10 years (1996 to 2006), 14 patients with neglected perilunate dislocations (undiagnosed or untreated for 6 weeks or more) were managed by ORIF. Six patients had dorsal trans-scaphoid perilunate dislocation, 6 patients had volar lunate dislocation while the remaining two had a dorsal perilunate dislocation The results were evaluated by clinical scoring system of Cooney et al. Results: The average followup was 4.1 years (range 2-12 years). All except one of the patients operated earlier than 5 months had good results. Of the four patients operated after 5 months, two had a fair result while two had a poor outcome. Chondral damage to the capitate was noted intraoperatively in both the cases with poor outcomes. The two patients were found to have avascular necrosis (AVN) of the lunate; however, functional outcome was fair in both, and both were able to return to their profession. Conclusion: We observed favorable functional results of ORIF in neglected perilunate dislocations up to 5 months after injury. The development of AVN or midcarpal arthritis was not a major disabling factor as long as stability of wrist has been restored. Beyond 5 months, an alternative surgical procedure such as proximal row carpectomy should be contemplated as results of ORIF have not been good uniformly.

Fractures of the Sustentaculum Tali: Injury Characteristics and Surgical Technique for Reduction	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Sustentaculum Tali; Calcaneus; Fracture; Open Reduction and Internal Fixation; Foot Injuries	CALCANEAL FRACTURES; SUBTALAR JOINT; INTRAARTICULAR FRACTURES; CONTACT CHARACTERISTICS; MEDIAL APPROACH	Background: The sustentaculum tali of the calcaneus is a vital load-bearing structure. Isolated sustentacular fractures are rare and may have implications for future hindfoot function. This retrospective cohort study describes sustentacular fracture patterns and characteristics, associated foot injuries, and a method of surgical treatment via a medial approach to the calcaneus. Materials and Methods: During a 7-year period, 19 surgically-treated sustentacular fractures without calcaneal posterior facet involvement were identified from a prospectively-collected database at a single Level 1 regional trauma center. Of these, 15 underwent open reduction and internal fixation utilizing a medial approach to the calcaneus. Patient charts, plain radiographs, and CT scans were reviewed for injury characteristics/morphology and associated musculoskeletal injuries. Results: Fourteen patients had associated ipsilateral foot/ankle injuries, and nine had other musculoskeletal injuries. Seven patients had intra-articular middle facet involvement, and seven had subtalar joint subluxation or dislocation. The medial approach to the calcaneus involves distal retraction of the neurovascular bundle and toe flexors. This allowed for an accurate indirect articular reduction using the extraarticular medial calcaneal cortex, as well as reduction of any associated subluxations. No complications were related to the surgical approach. Reduction was maintained through fracture healing. Conclusion: Fractures of the sustentaculum tali are rare injuries associated with high energy mechanisms, and associated ipsilateral foot injuries are common. Open reduction and internal fixation of these fractures was reliable and possible through a medial approach involving distal retraction of the digital flexors and neurovascular bundle, allowing for an anatomical extraarticular cortical reduction.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of all failed total ankles converted to fusion from 1999 to 2009 was performed at our institution. Results: Twelve total ankles were converted to isolated ankle fusions (Group I) and 12 converted to ankle-hindfoot fusions (Group H). All isolated ankle fusions were stabilized with anterior plate and screws with one nonunion. Structural bone graft was used in ten of 12. Mean outcome scores using the AOFAS-Ankle/Hindfoot score and Maryland Foot Score improved from preoperative values of 43 +/- 13 and 56.7 +/- 14 to 67 +/- 12 and 71.2 +/- 16 postoperatively, respectively (p < 0.05). All Group II ankle-hindfoot fusion patients were fixed using either anterior plate and screws, intramedullary nail, or a combination nail:plate construct. All received structural allografts. Five patients developed nonunion including four subtalar nonunions Preoperative scores on the AOFAS-AHS and MFS were 48.8 +/- 14 and 58.3 +/- 14. Postoperative scores were 51.2 +/- 17 for the AOFAS and 64.5 +/- 14 for the MFS. These changes were not statistically significant. However, the difference in nonunions was significant, p < 0.05. Conclusion: Failed total ankles can be successfully converted to fusion using structural bone graft and internal fixation. The primary risk appears to be nonunion of the subtalar joint when ankle-hindfoot fusion is required. We believe this risk can be decreased by using a separate approach for preparation of the subtalar joint.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the functional and radiologic outcomes of treating distal radius fractures with a resorbable volar polymeric implant system. Materials and methods: We applied the volar poly-5D/95L-lactide (PLA95) plate/screw system (Bonamates, BioTech One, New Taipei City, Taiwan) for intraosseous fixation after open reduction of distally displaced radius fracture in four patients (three males and one female, ages range: 7-67 years). Another four patients [three females and one male, ages 68-70 (68.8 +/- 1.0)] were treated with 3.5-mm metal volar T locking plates (Synthes, Paoli, PA, USA) as the control group. The minimum follow-up period was longer than 2.5 months for all cases. Results: At final functional and radiologic assessment, all of the distal radius fracture sites were united and one patient achieved excellent results, two patients had good results, and one had a fair result. All patient outcomes were satisfactory, and no major material-related infections or allergies were found. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this early clinical experiment, we conclude that the volar PLA95 copolymer plate/screw system can be used to treat distal radial fractures.

J	Gadegone, W; Salphale, YS; Lokhande, V				Gadegone, Wasudeo; Salphale, Yogesh S.; Lokhande, Vijayanand			Screw elastic intramedullary nail for the management of adult forearm fractures	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Fracture radius and ulna; radius fracture; ulna fracture; diaphyseal fracture; screw intramedullary nail	COMPRESSION-PLATE FIXATION; DIAPHYSEAL FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; MEDULLARY FIXATION; RADIUS; ULNA; BONES; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; REFRACTURE; REMOVAL	Background: The failure of the conventional nailing of both forearm bones or isolated fractures of radius and ulna pose a potential problem of nail migration and rotational instability, despite the best reduction. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the results of screw elastic intramedullary nail for the treatment of adult diaphyseal fractures of both forearm bones, which effectively addresses the problems associated with the conventional nailing systems for the forearm fractures. Materials and Methods: Seventy-six adults with forearm fractures (radius and ulna or isolated fracture of the single bone) were retrospectively evaluated. Fifty males and 26 females with the mean age of 38 years (range, 18-70 years) underwent closed reduction and screw intramedullary nail fixation. Ten patients required limited open reduction. The fractures were classified according to the AO/OTA system. The average followup was 12 months (range, 6 to 18 months). Results: The mean surgical time was 45 minutes (35 to 65 minutes). The meantime to union was 14 weeks (10-21 weeks). The results were graded as excellent in 50, good in 18 patients, and acceptable in eight patients, using the criteria of Grace and Eversman. We had superficial infection in three cases, one case of delayed infection, painful bursa in two cases, delayed union in two cases, malunion with dislocation of the DRUJ in two cases, injury to the extensor tendon of the thumb in one case, and one case of incomplete radioulnar synostosis. Conclusion: Closed reduction and internal fixation of forearm fractures by screw intramedullary nails reestablishes the near normal relationship of the fractured fragments. Screw intramedullary nail effectively controls both rotatory forces and the migration of the nail. It produces excellent clinical results in isolated fractures of either bones, as well as both bones of the forearm in adults.

Materials and methods: Fifty nonunions of the upper two-thirds of the humerus were treated by two different methods: 24 of them by unreamed locked nailing and bone graft (group A), and the other 26 by plate fixation and bone grafting (group B). Results: All fractures healed in both groups. In group A, the time required for healing was 4.2 months (range 4-6 months), whereas in group B it was 4.7 months (range 4-6 months). This difference was statistically significant (p<0.05). Functional results and the range of motion of the shoulder and elbow were similar with both techniques. In group B there were 3 cases of transient, iatrogenic, radial nerve palsy. Conclusions: We feel that both plate fixation and the unreamed humeral locked nail are good alternatives for the treatment of humeral shaft nonunions, although nailing achieves union earlier and has fewer complications.

Surgical Management of Mandibular Angle Fractures: Does the Extraction of the Third Molar Lead to a Change in the Fixation Pattern? A European Multicenter Survey	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article								Purpose: The authors conducted a retrospective, multicenter study to investigate the differences in the fixation patterns, in terms of number and thickness of plates, between patients in whom a third molar (3M) was maintained or removed in the line of mandibular angle fractures. Materials and methods: The study was conducted in 6 European level I and II maxillofacial trauma centers. Data were collected on patients >= 16 years of age who underwent open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) for mandibular angle fractures (MAF) from 2008 to 2018, in whom a 3M in the fracture line was present and who had a follow-up duration of 6 months. The study population was divided into 2 groups: patients treated with ORIF in whom the 3M was maintained (group 1) and those treated with ORIF in whom the 3M was extracted (group 2) during treatment. The 2 groups were compared for differences in the internal fixation pattern, specifically in terms of the number and thickness of the plates. Results: A total of 749 patients with 774 MAF were collected. A total of 1,050 plates were placed: 849 were <= 1.4 mm thick (80.9%) and 201 plates >= 1.5 mm thick (19.1%). 548 patients were treated with ORIF and 3M maintained (group 1), and 201 treated with ORIF and 3M extracted (group 2). Statistically significant differences were seen in the number of <= 1.4 mm plates between the 2 groups for single undisplaced/displaced MAF(P value <= 0.5) and for undisplaced/displaced angle + parasymphysis/body fractures (P-value <= 0.5). Conclusions: Analyses of data collected from 6 European maxillofacial centers indicated that the majority of surgeons of our sample perceived the MAF as being more unstable when removing the 3M during ORIF leading them to perform a rigid fixation in the angular region.

Comparison between percutaneous and traditional fixation of lumbar spine fracture: Intraoperative radiation exposure levels and outcomes	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Radioprotection; Percutaneous spine surgery; Open spine surgery; Thoracolumbar spine fracture; Minimally invasive spine surgery	PEDICLE SCREW FIXATION; THORACOLUMBAR BURST FRACTURE; FLUOROSCOPY; SURGEON; VERTEBROPLASTY; MANAGEMENT; PLACEMENT; INSERTION; PATIENT	Objective: To compare radiation exposure doses and clinical and radiological outcomes between percutaneous pedicular screwing (closed reduction internal fixation [CRIF]) and classical open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) in lumbar spine fracture without neurologic deficit. Materials and methods: Sixty patients (mean age, 42.5 years) were divided into two treatment groups: (Percutaneous) CRIF versus (traditional) ORIF. Screw position and anatomic vertebral reconstruction were checked on routine control X-ray and postoperative CT scan. Study parameters comprised: surgery time, radiation exposure time, radiation dose level for X-ray (DAP) and for CT (DLP), blood loss, length of hospital stay and postoperative pain (VAS). Results: At a mean 25.5 months' follow-up, there were no significant inter-group differences on the epidemiological parameters: age, gender, fracture level, fracture type on the Magerl classification, preoperative local vertebral kyphosis angle, or fracture-to-surgery interval. Effective radiation dose was 3-fold higher in CRIF than in ORIF, but 6-fold lower than for the postoperative CT scan. Postoperative pain on VAS was significantly lower after CRIF, allowing earlier gait resumption and return to work and daily activity. There were no significant differences in length of hospital stay, patient satisfaction, screw malpositioning or postoperative or end-of-follow-up kyphosis angle. Conclusion: Percutaneous surgery provided clinical and radiological outcomes strictly comparable to those of open surgery, but with a higher effective radiation exposure dose, including for the medical team and especially for the surgeon. This higher exposure dose, however, is to be relativized by comparison to that of the postoperative CT scan, which involved a much higher exposure dose for the patient.

Material/Methods: Two hundred and seventy patients with bilateral AVN of the femoral head were admitted for elective surgery, and 176 patients underwent THA (the THA group), and 94 patients underwent closed reduction screw fixation (the traditional surgery group). The Harris hip score (HHS) was used pre-operatively and to evaluate postoperative outcome. Results: The mean operation time in the traditional surgery group (82.6 +/- 15.6 min) was significantly less compared with the THA group (104.8 +/- 14.2 min) (P=0.001). Intraoperative blood loss in the traditional surgery group (219.8 +/- 21.6 mL) was significantly less compared with the THA group (339.4 +/- 29.4 mL) (P=0.001). After treatment, the mean HHS score of the THA group (76.5 +/- 9.2 points) was significantly increased when compared with the traditional surgery group (61.4 +/- 10.5 points) (P=0.001). Disease recurrence rate in the THA group was significantly reduced compared with the traditional surgery group (P=0.001). The mean quality of life score of the THA group (85.5 +/- 6.4 points) was significantly higher than that of the traditional surgery group (73.4 +/- 8.8 points) (P=0.001). Conclusions: Compared with closed reduction screw fixation, THA for AVN of the femoral head effectively reduced the length of hospital stay, time to recovery, and achieved an improved clinical outcome.

Case presentation: A 62-year old woman was seen after the urinary expulsion of a 6.5 mm diameter cancellous screw. About seven years earlier, she had been hit by a motorcyclist while crossing the street. On admission at the time of the initial injury, thoraco-abdominal computerized tomography with intravenous contrast material revealed a bladder injury and pelvic ring fractures. An anterior-posterior type injury to the pelvic ring was diagnosed with symphyseal pubis disruption, and widening of the left sacroiliac joint with an associated sacral fracture. Explorative laparotomy revealed two bladder lacerations of both the posterior and the anterior bladder wall, which were repaired primarily. Orthopedic surgeons reduced the pelvis and stabilized it with two plates and screws. Seven years after the original injury, the patient presented with recurrent abdominal pain after expelling a screw into the toilet while urinating. Planar radiographs showed only five of the original screws remaining in the two symphyseal plates, and all screws appeared to have loosened when compared to the original fixation radiograph. Conclusion: This clinical report emphasizes the importance of symphyseal plate positioning and the sequelae of imprecise positioning, especially postero-superiorly adjacent to the Retzius space. The presence of protruding metal prominences, even smooth ones like a plate corner or screw head, might endanger the bladder. When using superior plates, imprecise contouring may lead to plate edge protrusion which could damage the bladder even long after application.

J	Wei, XM; Sun, ZZ; Rui, YJ; Song, XJ				Wei, Xu-ming; Sun, Zhen-zhong; Rui, Yong-jun; Song, Xiao-Jun			Minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis for distal radius fractures	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Distal radius fracture; minimally invasive plate fixation; palmar locking plate	DISPLACED INTRAARTICULAR FRACTURES; EXTERNAL FIXATION; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; LOCKING PLATE; COMPLICATIONS; HUMERUS; TRIAL; TIBIA; MIPO	Background: Fractures of distal radius are common injury in all age groups. Cast treatment with or without close reduction is a viable option. However, the results are often unsatisfactory with restricted function. The open reduction and internal fixation often results in extensive soft tissue dissection and associated high rates of infect and delayed/nonunion. The distractor/external fixator have reported good functional and anatomical results but the incidence of pin traction infection nerve injury and cosmedic deformity are high. We introduced a modified operative technique for minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) for distal radial fracture and evaluated the functional outcomes and complications. Materials and Methods: 22 distal radial fractures (10 left, 12 right) were treated using the MIPO technique and two small incisions with a palmar locking plate from August 2009 to August 2010. The wrist function was assessed according to Dienst wrist rating system, and postoperative complications were recorded. Results: According to Dienst wrist rating system, 13 patients showed excellent results, 6 cases showed good results and 3 patients had moderate results. No patient had poor results. Thus, the excellent and good rate was 86.4%. One patient had anesthesia in the thenar eminence and this symptom disappeared after 3 months. One patient had delayed healing in the proximal wrist crease. Two patients had mild pain on the ulnar side of the wrist and two patients had limited wrist joint function. Conclusion: The MIPO technique by using two small palmar incisions is safe and effective for treatment of distal radial fractures.

Different osteosyntheses for Colles' fracture	ACTA ORTHOPAEDICA			English	Article							DISTAL RADIUS; INTERNAL-FIXATION; PLATE; OSTEOPOROSIS; MULTICENTER; REDUCTION	Background and purpose In recent years several different plate designs for internal fixation of fractures of the distal radius have been developed. However, few biomechanical studies have been performed to compare these new implants. The purpose of this study was to compare the mechanical properties of 5 different commercially available plates (3 volar and 2 dorsal) with standard K-wire fixation using a distal radial cadaver model. Material and methods 42 human radial bones from 26 cadavers were included. The bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by DEXA in all bones, and the radial bones were assigned to 6 equiv alent groups based on bone density and total amount of mineral. A distal radial osteotomy was done and a dorsal 30-degree wedge of bone was removed. 1 K-wire fixation group and 5 plate groups were tested for rigidity, yield load, and maximum load. Results When data from dorsally and volarly applied plates were pooled, we did not find any statistically significant differences between them regarding stiffness, yield load, and maximum load. The K-wire group showed significantly lower yield load than 3 of the plate groups. There were no statistically significant differences in yield load between the 5 plate groups. The K-wire group showed lower rigidity than the plate groups. The K-wire group and 1 plate group failed at a statistically significant lower maximum load than the 4 other plate groups. Interpretation The volar plates had the same mechanical stability as the dorsally applied plates, and they are therefore a good alternative to dorsally applied plates. K-wire osteosynthesis was inferior to plate osteosyntheses regarding all mechanical properties.

We present an alternative technique that the bone grafts harvested from the fracture borders or from the iliac crest were used instead of plates and the fixation was done with screws. In the study including 24 mandible fractures, the bone grafts harvested from the fracture borders were used in the 10 favorable fractures and the bone grafts harvested from the iliac crest were used in the 14 unfavorable fractures. In the combined mandible fractures, four fractures were fixated with titanium plates and the other side with the bone graft. The patients, who were followed up for 12 to 20 months, were evaluated with macroscopic occlusion, panoramic graphs, and three-dimensional computerized tomographs. The advantage of this technique of fixation with the autogenous tissue is reduced infection rates and reduced operation costs. In the pediatric patients, the second session operation of plate removal is not necessary.

Despite innovations in osteosynthesis materials, the rate of complications remains at 10%-59% in Pauwels type III (PIII) fractures. The authors thus propose a fixation model with a novel self-compression screw, comparing it to a sliding hip screw plate associated with a derotation screw in the fixation of a PIII fracture with posterior inferior comminution. The finite element method (FEM) was used in this comparison along with a virtual femur model with structural characteristics similar to those of a healthy young human bone. We formed 4 groups: Group 1 (GC), intact bone; Group 2 (SHS+S), sliding hip screw plate with derotation screw; Group 3 (XS), X-pin + SS (self-compression model with superior positioning screw); Group 4 (XI), X-pin + IS (self-compression model with inferior positioning screw). A 700 N monotonic load was applied to the apex of the femur head towards the ground so that stress was mainly focused on the fracture site and osteosynthesis. Analyses included total displacement and maximum principal stress and were performed for all groups. Fracture displacement, rotation, and von Mises were assessed only in groups that underwent osteosynthesis. Total displacement values in groups with self-compression screws (XS and XI) were closer to those for healthy femurs, with a 38.5% reduction when comparing the XS group with the SHS+S group. Fracture displacement and rotation values presented reductions of over 60% when comparing the XS and XI groups with the SHS+S group. Equivalent Von Mises stress values were similar between XS and XI and presented a reduction of approximately 5.25% when compared with the SHS+S group. Our FEM analyses demonstrated that the self-compression screw model has potential biomechanical advantages over the SHS+S model.

Anatomic reduction and proper stabilization are essential to obtain articular congruity so that late-onset arthritis can be avoided. The main areas of interest in this intriguing fracture are the choice of implant and the surgical approach. We describe the use of anterolateral approach and headless double-threaded compression screws for the fixation of this fracture. Materials and methods: This prospective study included 16 capitellar fractures. A computed tomography scan was done for delineating the fracture line and planning the fixation technique. All fractures were treated with headless double-threaded compression screws using an anterolateral approach, over a period of 3 years, with a mean follow-up of 2.3 years (range, 1.5-4 years). Results: The average time to bony union was 3.5 months (range, 2.5-5 months) with no malunion or nonunion. The mean range of flexion was 132 degrees (range, 125 degrees-135 degrees). The average extensor lag was 10 degrees (range, 0 degrees-25 degrees), but the range of motion remained functional in all patients. On the final follow-up, no evidence of osteonecrosis, post-traumatic osteoarthritis, or heterotrophic ossification was seen. The outcome was excellent in 10 patients, and 6 patients had a good result. Conclusions: The success of management of a capitellar fracture depends on an early diagnosis by keeping a high index of suspicion and timely management. Adequate exposure of the fracture is of paramount importance to achieve accurate reduction. This can be satisfactorily achieved by an anterolateral approach to the elbow. An adequate fixation of the fractured fragments can be achieved by the use of headless doublethreaded compression screws. (C) 2016 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

Tibiocalcaneal Arthrodesis Using a Simple External Fixator	JOURNAL OF FOOT & ANKLE SURGERY			English	Article						ankle; calcaneus; external fixation; hindfoot; talus; tibia	CANCELLOUS-BONE SCREWS; ANKLE ARTHRODESIS; STABILITY; JOINT	Tibiocalcaneal arthrodesis has been a salvage option for conditions with extensive loss of the talar body. In conditions that preclude the use of internal fixation, external compression arthrodesis has been the preferred technique to achieve fusion about the hindfoot. Since Sir John Charnley elucidated the technique of compression arthrodesis using compression clamps, various modifications and techniques of external compression arthrodesis have been described. Various clinical and biomechanical studies have established the superiority of triangular transfixation in external compression arthrodesis. We have described a simple technique of compression arthrodesis after the principle of triangular transfixation using easily available hardware from Ilizarov instrumentation. This technique is relatively inexpensive in terms of the cost of the materials, uses a modular construct, and allows multiplanar correction of the hindfoot. It can be used intra-operatively to distract the hindfoot joints, especially in the presence of fibrosis and poor skin conditions. We believe this device can be a reasonable alternative to the conventional external fixation techniques for tibiocalcaneal arthrodesis. (C) 2014 by the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

There is no consensus on type of fixation. Due to the rarity of the injury, it is difficult to compare different techniques of osteosynthesis. Objectives The aim of this study was to present the long-term results of an alternative method of plating Ogawa type IIB meta-acromion fractures and to review the literature. Design Retrospective study. Materials and methods We present a case series of 11 consecutive patients with displaced Ogawa type IIB meta-acromion fracture, treated with open reduction internal fixation using a 3.5-mm contoured pelvic reconstruction plate with a 90 degrees twist. Patients' mean age was 53.3 years (23-80 years) and the mean follow-up was 48.3 months (15 months-9 years). The outcomes related to pain and shoulder function were evaluated by Modified American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Score (ASES) and SF-36 score. All patients were asked about their satisfaction level. Results Nine out of eleven patients were included in this study. Eight of them obtained union and all were satisfied with the final outcome. The mean ASES and SF-36 score were 69.75 (42.4-98.14) and 61.37 (41.64-94.99), respectively, with poor scores to be largely associated with comorbidities and concomitant injuries. Conclusions The use of 3.5-mm reconstruction plate with a 90 degrees twist for open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) of meta-acromion fractures presents satisfactory results and could be technically a more stable biomechanical construct in comparison to the existing surgical techniques.

Materials and methods: From January 2016 to December 2019, 16 cases of multi segment tibial fractures with proximal fractures were selected, including 10 males and 6 females, aged 20 similar to 68 years, who were treated with percutaneous locking plate system assisted by tibial interlocking intramedullary nail. 9 cases of them were injured by traffic accident, 3 cases were injured by heavy pound, and 3 cases were injured by falling down; 12 cases were closed fractures and 4 cases were open fractures. The patients were followed up from 14 months to 30 months after operation. X- rays were reexamined to understand the fracture healing and kolment and Wulff methods were used to evaluate the knee function after internal fixation. Results: The average operation time of 16 patients was 98 (76 similar to 132) min. The average fracture healing time after operation was 30 (26 similar to 40) weeks. All fractures healed. There were no complications such as fracture nonunion, infection, and vascular and nerve injury. The knee joint function was excellent 3 months similar to after operation. Conclusion: The medullary cavity of the upper tibial fracture is large, and the simple interlocking intramedullary nail fixation will lead to complications such as displacement, delayed fracture healing and internal fixation failure. The percutaneous locking plate and screw system assisted by the tibial interlocking intramedullary nail can achieve satisfactory reduction and firm fixation, allow early postoperative functional exercise, and achieve good curative effect.

The connection mode of horizontal connection includes hR-R CL and hS-S CL. hS-S CL adopted in C1-2 PSR was rarely reported and its biomechanics are still unclear.Materials and Methods: Six fresh cadaveric cervical spine specimens were each tested as an Intact model, then modified and tested as an Instability model (unstable odontoid fractures), and then as 3 internal fixation models, including C1-2 PSR, C1-2 pedicle screw-rod+horizontal rod-rod crosslink (C1-2 PSR+ hR-R CL), C1-2 pedicle screw-rod+horizontal screw-screw crosslink (C1-2 PSR+ hS-S CL). The ROM of the C1-2 segments was measured by applying 1.5 nm load in 6 loading conditions, including flexion-extension (FE), left and right lateral bending (LB), and left and right axial rotation (AR).Results: The C1-2 PSR+hR-R CL and C1-2 PSR+hS-S CL models, respectively, showed 60% and 75% lower ROM than the C1-2 PSR model in LB and AR conditions (P<0.05). ROM was comparable between the C1-2 PSR+hR-R CL and the C1-2 PSR+hS-S CL models in all loading conditions (P>0.05).Conclusion: Both types of crosslinks showed superior C1-2 stability under LB and AR conditions than PSR without crosslinks. The C1-2 segment stability was comparable between the 2 types of crosslinks themselves.

In this study, we examined the clinical, radiographic, and functional outcomes following operative stabilization of Bryan and Morrey type IV fractures of the capitellum in adolescents. We applied headless cannulated screws in a posteroanterior direction without damaging the articular cartilage surface of the fractures. Eight adolescent patients (six male, two female) with a mean age of 15 +/- A 2.1 years (range 13-18 years) were treated for type IV (McKee) humerus capitellum fractures. In the preoperative radiological evaluation, anteroposterior and lateral radiographs and computed tomography (CT) images were performed. A lateral surgical approach was used, and cannulated fully threaded headless screws were applied in a posteroanterior direction as fixation materials in the fracture reduction. The Mayo Elbow Performance Score was used in the evaluation of elbow joint functions. Patients were followed up for a mean of 24.6 months. Fracture union was achieved at a mean of 5 +/- A 0.92 weeks (range 4-6 weeks). The mean elbow extension flexion arc was 135A degrees A A +/- A 13.47A degrees (range 110A degrees-150A(0)) and the mean pronation supination arc was 156A degrees A A +/- A 4.43A degrees (150A degrees-160A degrees). In one patient, there was nonconformity in the humerus trochlea and in another patient, there was keloid formation on the surgical scar. All patients attained excellent results according to the Mayo Elbow Performance Score. In the treatment of type IV capitellum fractures in adolescents, open reduction with a lateral surgical approach and fixation using posteroanterior directed, cannulated, fully threaded, headless screws is a reliable method to achieve a pain-free functional elbow joint.

Management of proximal metaphyseal curvilinear tibial fractures in 25 skeletally immature dogs (2009 to 2020)	JOURNAL OF SMALL ANIMAL PRACTICE			English	Article							TUBEROSITY AVULSION FRACTURE; TRAMPOLINE FRACTURE; COMPLICATIONS; CHILDREN; VALGA	Objectives To describe the occurrence, management and outcome of proximal metaphyseal curvilinear tibial fractures in skeletally immature dogs. Materials and Methods A multi-centre retrospective review was conducted, searching for skeletally immature dogs presenting with proximal metaphyseal curvilinear tibial fractures between January 2009 and September 2020. Signalment, fracture description and case management data were retrieved. Outcome was assessed by retrospectively evaluating follow-up radiographs, hospital records and an owner questionnaire. Results Twenty-five dogs met the inclusion criteria. All but one fracture was a result of minimal trauma. Twenty fractures were managed with internal fixation, two with external fixation and three conservatively. All 25 fractures healed. Eight major complications occurred in seven of 25 (28%) dogs. Twelve minor complications occurred in 10 of 25 (40%) dogs. Owner questionnaire data were available for 12 of 25 dogs; 11 of 12 were reported as having full function and one of 12 as having acceptable function at the time of questioning (median 34.5 months following presentation). At final follow-up, either by clinical examination or owner questionnaire, full function was achieved in 22 of 25 patients and acceptable function in three of 25. Clinical Significance This study reported a series of proximal metaphyseal tibial fractures in skeletally immature dogs. The most common fixation method was internal fixation, which frequently resulted in full limb function at final follow-up. Owners reported outcome as fully functional in all dogs that underwent surgery at first presentation and had owner follow-up available, though positive outcomes may have been affected by participation bias.

Material/Methods: A patient with ADS underwent internal fixation by pedicle screws after posterior incision in combination with subtotal laminectomy decompression and bone graft fusion, and received thin-layer computed tomography (CT) spine scanning at T12-L5. The CT data were used to constitute three-dimensional FE full-segment, interval, key vertebral, and strategic pedicle screw models. The stress of each screw-rod system under different working conditions was evaluated. Results: Forward flexion, backward extension, lateral flexion, and rotation greatly increased the force of the pedicle screw systems. The maximum stress of the screw-rods was the lowest in the full-segment model under almost all the working conditions except for the upright situation. The maximum stress of the vertebral bodies was the minimum in the strategic model under all the 7 working conditions, followed by that in the key vertebra and full-segment models. Conclusions: Collectively, the strategic and key vertebra pedicle screw schemes can decrease the biomechanical stress of screw-rod systems and vertebral bodies, which is close to the full-segment scheme. Our results may help explore the optimal surgical means for pedicle screw fixation for ADS patients, which can maximally reduce the risk of screws-related postoperative complications and simultaneously maintain a reasonable 3D orthopedic effect.

Material/Methods: Patients with UOSF were included and divided into 2 groups: a TiRobot-assisted surgical group with 18 patients (robot-aided sacroiliac screw fixation and bone grafting) and a standard surgical group with 15 patients (freehand screw fixation without bone grafting). T values of bone mineral density (BMD) -2.5 pound standard deviation (SD) were diagnosed as osteoporosis. Screw positioning and fracture healing time were evaluated. Functional outcomes were investigated at the final follow-up. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in screw positioning; however, there were satisfactory positioning rates in 94.4% (17/18) of patients in the TiRobot-assisted surgical group and 73.3% (11/15) in the standard surgical group. The advantages with TiRobot on surgical time of screw placement, fluoroscopy frequency, and total drilling times were noted (P=0.000). The nonunion rates were 5.6% (1/18) in the TiRobot-assisted surgical group and 33.3% (5/15) in the standard group (P=0.039). Healing time in the union cases had a significant difference (P=0.031). Functional outcome scores in the TiRobot-assisted surgical group were superior to that in the standard group (P=0.014). Conclusions: The findings showed that TiRobot-assisted sacroiliac screw fixation and bone grafting was a safe and effective surgical treatment option that had a reduced radiation dose and improved fracture healing, when compared with standard screw fixation without bone grafting.

Aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of the different fixation methods used for fixation of PMF by finite element analysis (FEA) and to compare the effect of fixation constructs on the size of the fracture computationally. Materials and methods: Three dimensional model of the tibia was reconstructed from computed tomography (CT) images. PMF of 30%, 40% and 50% fragment sizes were simulated through computational processing. Two antero-posterior (AP) lag screws, two postero-anterior (PA) lag screws and posterior buttress plate were analysed for three different fracture volumes. The simulated loads of 350 N and 700 N were applied to the proximal tibial end. Models were fixed distally in all degrees of freedom. Results: In single limb standing condition, the posterior plate group produced the lowest relative displacement (RD) among all the groups (0.01, 0.03 and 0.06 mm). Further nodal analysis of the highest RD fracture group showed a higher mean displacement of 4.77 mm and 4.23 mm in AP and PA lag screws model (p = 0.000). The amounts of stress subjected to these implants, 134.36 MPa and 140.75 MPa were also significantly lower (p = 0.000). There was a negative correlation (p = 0.021) between implant stress and the displacement which signifies a less stable fixation using AP and PA lag screws. Conclusion: Progressively increasing fracture size demands more stable fixation construct because RD increases significantly. Posterior buttress plate produces superior stability and lowest RD in PMF models irrespective of the fragment size. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Minimally invasive techniques have been developed to decrease the risk of skin complications. The objective of this study was to compare C-Nail (R) locking-nail fixation to conventional plate fixation for DIACFs. Hypothesis: C-Nail (R) fixation restores calcaneal anatomy similarly to conventional plate fixation and decreases the frequency of skin complications compared to conventional plate fixation, while providing satisfactory functional outcomes. Material and methods: In this case-control study of DIACFs, fixation was with a non-locking plate in 30 patients treated between January 2016 and June 2017 and with the C-Nail (R) in 25 patients treated between April 2017 and April 2018. Computed tomography was performed before surgery then bilaterally after surgery for measurements of the following calcaneal parameters: height, length, width, joint-surface stepoff and inter-fragmentary distance. The values of these parameters were compared between the two groups. Postoperative skin complications were recorded. The functional outcome was assessed by determining the AOFAS score 1 year after the injury. Results: The two groups showed no significant differences for age, sex or fracture type. Wound healing was delayed in 3 patients in the plate group. The mean postoperative values of the calcaneal parameters were not significantly different between the two groups. The mean AOFAS score was 85.3 +/- 10.4 (range, 50-100) in the plate group and 87.0 +/- 12.0 (range, 64-100) in the C-Nail (R) group (p > 0.05). Discussion: Minimally invasive C-Nail (R) fixation provides similar restoration of calcaneal anatomy as does conventional plate fixation. Level of evidence: III, retrospective case-control study.

Part I comprises of the results of the analysis for mandibular advancement, four different fixation configurations of six hole fragmentation mini plates with monocortical screws and lag screws and posterior loading conditions in the molar and premolar region. The finite element analysis method (FEA) appears suitable for simulating complex mechanical stress situations in the maxillofacial region. The mechanical behavior of selected lag screws with linear or triangular configuration and double parallel or single oblique six hole mini plates with monocortical screws were compared by FEA after 5 mm BSSRO advancement procedure. Four separate three-dimensional finite element models of the mandible were created to simulate the BSSRO and corresponding fixation methods. These models consisted of 122,717 elements and 25,048 nodes. The mechanical parameters of the materials studied were adopted from the literature or were based on manufacturer's information. 500 N posterior occlusal loads were simulated on the distal segments. The commercial finite element solver MSC Marc software was utilized to calculate the stress fields on both the segments and fixative appliances. It was concluded that the use of 2.0 mm lag screws placed in a triangular configuration following the BSSRO advancement surgery provides sufficient stability with any rotational movement and less stress fields at the osteotomy site, when compared with the other rigid fixation methods used in the current study.

Historically, these fractures were treated nonoperatively; however, recent data suggest an increased risk of nonunion and symptomatic malunion for displaced, comminuted midshaft clavicular fractures treated conservatively. Surgical intervention via plate osteosynthesis or intramedullary fixation with pins, nails, or screws has been shown to reduce, but not eliminate, this risk. Identification of risk factors predictive of nonunion would improve the overall management of displaced, comminuted midshaft clavicular fractures. The medical records of 337 consecutive patients who underwent Knowles pin fixation and supplemental cerclage for the treatment of displaced, comminuted midshaft clavicular fractures between April 2007 and March 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. The records of the mechanism of injury, side of injury, Robinson fracture classification, presence of associated injuries, cerclage material, and patient-related variables, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension and smoking, were analyzed. Variables were assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis to identify those factors significantly associated with the development of fracture nonunion. A total of 19 nonunions occurred. Increasing age and use of wire for supplemental cerclage fixation were significantly associated with an increased risk for fracture nonunion (p < 0.001). Although suggested as predictors of nonunion in other studies, female gender and fracture severity were not significantly associated with nonunion. Nonunion remains a significant complication in the treatment of displaced, comminuted midshaft clavicular fractures even with intramedullary fixation. Use of absorbable suture in place of wire for cerclage fixation and careful selection of treatment strategy in the elderly may reduce the risk for nonunion.

Because the patient had serious motor and sensory neuropathy associated with his disease, special anesthetic and surgical recommendations had to be considered before he underwent general anesthesia to repair his mandibular fracture. Materials and Methods: Repair of the mandible was performed under general anesthesia with a nasal endotracheal tube and the use of the nondepolarizing muscle relaxant rocuronium. Open reduction and internal fixation through extraoral approaches were used to fixate the displaced right subcondylar and symphyseal fractures. A closed reduction approach using maxillary fixation screws and a mandibular arch bar with light elastic guidance was used to treat a nondisplaced fracture of the left mandibular ramus. Rigid fixation allowed for avoidance of a period of intermaxillary fixation. Results: General anesthesia and muscle relaxant were administered without complication. Treatment of bilateral mandibular fractures with combined open and closed approaches resulted in restoration of premorbid occlusion and masticatory function. Conclusion: Repair of mandibular fractures under general anesthesia appears to be a safe procedure in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease when appropriate anesthetic and surgical methods are used.

Comparison of Different Fixation Configurations in Different Types of High Pediatric Supracondylar Humerus Fractures: a Finite Element Analysis	ACTA CHIRURGIAE ORTHOPAEDICAE ET TRAUMATOLOGIAE CECHOSLOVACA			English	Article						high pediatric supracondylar humerus fracture; percutaneous fixation method; metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction; finite element analysis	METAPHYSEAL-DIAPHYSEAL JUNCTION; KIRSCHNER WIRE FIXATION; PATTERNS; CHILDREN	PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The purpose of this study is to compare the stability of different fixation methods in high pediatric supracondylar humerus fractures with a finite element analysis method. MATERIAL AND METHODS Transverse, lateral oblique, and medial oblique fracture models were created in a ten years old boy's distal humerus. Eight different fixation methods were applied to each fracture model. Displacement of the fracture models was measured under the translational and torsional forces. RESULTS In the transverse fracture model; the 6th method provided the best stability in internal rotation, external rotation, and extension loading. In varus 7th method, valgus 8th, and flexion the 5th and 2nd methods had the best stability. In the lateral oblique fracture model; the 7th method had the best stability in all loading directions except flexion and the 6th method had the best stability in flexion and had acceptable values in all other directions except valgus and external rotation. In the medial oblique fracture model; the 6th method had the best stability in all directions except varus. 3rd method was the best fixation type against varus and the second stable fixation type in all other directions. CONCLUSIONS Combining lateral antegrade with lateral retrograde wire and lateral condylomedullary wire provides strong stability in the lateral oblique fracture. Two condylomedullary Kirchner wires and one antegrade lateral wire results in a strong stability in the medial oblique fracture. Medial-lateral condylomedullary and lateral antegrade wires provided the best stability against varus in transverse and lateral oblique fractures.

Materials and Methods: Fifty synthetic polyurethane hemimandible replicas were subjected to linear loading tests to evaluate 4 fixation techniques of the sagittal split ramus osteotomy using 2-mm system plates and screws. The hemimandibles were fixed with three 90 degrees linear screws, three 60 degrees linear screws, 3 screws in a reversed L arrangement, and one titanium miniplate. Each group was subjected to linear loading using an Instron 4411 servohydraulic mechanical testing unit. The load peak value and peak displacement were measured. Another 4 hemimandible replicas were made of photoelastic resin and subjected to photoelastic analysis after linear loading with a 3-mm displacement. Results: The results of the mechanical tests showed statistically significant differences between the fixation groups. The linear 90 degrees fixation and the reversed L arrangement presented with greater loading resistance, followed by the linear 60 degrees fixation and miniplates. In relation to the stress distribution in the photoelastic analysis, the fringes were concentrated near the osteotomy and to the lower part of the mandible in the linear 90 degrees-screw system and reversed L arrangement. In the case of the linear 60 degrees screws, most fringes were located around and between the screws. In the case of the miniplates, the fringes were concentrated around the screws near the osteotomy and more distally. Conclusion: Under the conditions tested, the linear 90 degrees and reversed L arrangements provided the most favorable behavior.

Finite element analysis of posterior cervical fixation	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Three-column injuries; Finite element model; Posterior cervical fixation technique	LATERAL MASS SCREWS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; PEDICLE SCREWS; SPINE; SYSTEM; CLASSIFICATION; BIOMECHANICS; CABLE; WIRE	Background context: Despite largely, used in the past, biomechanical test, to investigate the fixation techniques of subaxial cervical spine, information is lacking about the internal structural response to external loading. It is not yet clear which technique represents the best choice and whether stabilization devices can be efficient and beneficial for three-column injuries (TCI). Hypothesis: The different posterior cervical fixation techniques (pedicle screw PS, lateral mass screw LS, and transarticular screw TS) have respective indications. Materials and methods: A detailed, geometrically accurate, nonlinear C3-C7 finite element model ( FEM) had been successfully developed and validated. Then three FEMs were reconstructed from different fixation techniques after C4-C6 TCI. A compressive preload of 74 N combined with a pure moment of 1.8 Nm in flexion, extension, left-right lateral bending, and left-right axial rotation was applied to the FEMs. Results: The ROM results showed that there were obvious significant differences when comparing the different fixation techniques. PS and TS techniques can provide better immediate stabilization, compared to LS technique. The stress results showed that the variability of von Mises stress in the TS fixation device was minimum and LS fixation device was maximum. Furthermore, the screws inserted by TS technique had high stress concentration at the middle part of the screws. Screw inserted by PS and LS techniques had higher stress concentration at the actual cap-rod-screw interface. Conclusions: The research considers that spinal surgeon should first consider using the TS technique to treat cervical TCI. If PS technique is used, we should eventually prolong the need for external bracing in order to reduce the higher risk of fracture on fixation devices. If LS technique is used, we should add anterior cervical operation for acquire a better immediate stabilization. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.	[Duan, Y.; Wang, H. H.; Jin, A.

This three-dimensional finite element (FE) study compared the stability of C2LAM using offset connectors (C2LAM + OF) with other methods. Materials and methods Occipital and cervical spine computed tomography images of a healthy 30-year-old man were selected to build the FE model. Four internal fixation instruments including occiput plate-C2 pedicle (C2P) and pars (C2Pars) screws, as well as C2LAM and C2LAM + OF were applied consecutively to the model respectively to establish four new models, which were subjected to all states of motion and physiological loads to simulate normal movement, including the four kinds of basic activities of human such as flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation. Physiological measures and comparison included the range of motion (ROM) and stress distribution in the model. Results ROM between the fixation techniques was comparable, and the stability of the C2LAM + OF fixation technique was similar to that of C2P. Screw entry points, offset connectors and rods were the main stress distribution regions in the C2LAM + OF system. The mean von Mises stress of the inner wall was significantly smaller than that of the outer wall in flexion, extension, and rotation (p < 0.05); however, lateral bending was comparable, indicating a relatively small risk of damage to the inner wall. Conclusions The results of this study indicate that the C2LAM + OF fusion technique can provide sufficient stability and can be used as an alternative to C2P under special circumstances.

Recent studies have demonstrated that trimalleolar fractures adversely affect the functional outcomes in comparison to bimalleolar fractures of the lateral and medial malleolus. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of posterior malleolus fixation on the functional and radiological outcomes. Materials and Methods: Reduction quality, development of posttraumatic ankle osteoarthritis, and functional outcomes in 49 consecutive trimalleolar ankle fractures were evaluated retrospectively in patients with and without posterior malleolus fixation. Group I consisted of 29 patients, in which posterior malleolar fracture was left untreated. Twenty patients in Group II, posterior malleolar fragment was fixed directly by screws alone or plate screw. Twenty-one of these 49 patients were male (43%). The mean age was 47 years (range 20-82 years). Results: The mean followup was 12 to 51 months with a mean of 15 months (range 12-51 months). Statistically significant differences were found between Group I and Group II in terms of ankle arthrosis. American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score was significantly lower in Group I compared to Groups II. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that posterior malleolar fracture fixation is closely related to successful radiological and functional outcomes after trimalleolar fractures. Transyndesmal screw fixation may not be needed in the cases where the posterior malleolar fracture fixated. For these reasons, we recommend that all posterior malleolar fractures have to be fixed regardless of size.

Although several clinical studies have shown that the use of TENs is more effective and less invasive than traditional plate fixation, high rates of complications associated with TENs have been reported. This retrospective study compared the use of TENs with reconstruction plates in the treatment of displaced midshaft clavicular fractures. Materials and methods: From January 2005 to July 2007, 141 patients with displaced midshaft clavicular fractures were treated with TEN or plate fixation. At 6 and 24 months postoperatively, we evaluated the patients' general health, operative complications, and functional recovery. Results: The mean bone union time of TEN patients was 12.4 +/- 3.4 weeks, whereas that in the plate group was 14.4 +/- 3.7 weeks. The time of union was significantly shorter in the TEN group than that in the plate group. There was no significant difference between these 2 groups' rates of complications such as nonunion or malunion. Shoulder function scores were significantly better in the TEN group than in the plate group at 6 months postoperatively. There was no significant difference at 24 months postoperatively. Patients were more satisfied with the cosmetic appearance and overall outcome after TEN repair than after plate fixation. Conclusions: TEN fixation of displaced midshaft clavicular fractures allows for a faster functional recovery, higher patient satisfaction, and a more cosmetically satisfactory appearance than plate fixation. The complication rates of both TENs and reconstruction plates were similar. (C) 2012 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

Biomechanical performance of rotator cuff repairs with humeral rotation - A new rotator cuff repair failure model	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	32nd Annual Meeting of the American-Orthopaedic-Society-for-Sports-Medicine	JUN 29-JUL 02, 2006	Hershey, PA			rotator cuff; repair; biomechanics; shoulder; tendon	SUTURE ANCHOR FIXATION; TENDON-BONE INTERFACE; FULL-THICKNESS TEARS; ARTHROSCOPIC REPAIR; SINGLE-ROW; TRANSOSSEOUS SUTURE; TENSION OVERLOAD; FOLLOW-UP; MINI-OPEN; FOOTPRINT	Background: Traditional biomechanical evaluations of rotator cuff repair techniques employ cyclic loading of the supraspinatus tendon in an isolated medial direction. Purpose: This study was conducted to evaluate 2 different rotator cuff repair techniques that are currently the subject of debate with cyclic loading and with internal and external humeral rotation to better simulate postoperative rehabilitation. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Nine fresh-frozen paired human cadaver shoulders (18 shoulders) were studied. A single-row repair with 2 suture anchors was compared with a double-row repair with 4 suture anchors. The shoulders were tested in a custom device to position the shoulder in neutral, 45 degrees of internal rotation, and 45 degrees of external rotation. Cyclic loading of the supraspinatus tendon was performed with an MTS material testing machine. Gap formation was measured and analyzed for each rotational, position using the MTS device. Results: For the single-row repair, average gap formation per 100 cycles in the positions of neutral, internal, and external humeral rotation was 1.47 +/- 0.63, 3.11 +/- 1.55, and 2.24 +/- 0.94 mm, respectively. For the double-row repair, average gap formation per 100 cycles in the positions of neutral, internal, and external humeral rotation was 1.25 +/- 0.54, 2.29 +/- 1.10, and 1.57 +/- 0.48 mm, respectively. For gapping averaged over all positions, the double-row repair had significantly less gapping than the single-row repair (P = .0109); gapping was greatest for internal rotation, followed by external rotation, and least for neutral (P < .0001). Conclusion: The testing method of including a rotational component in biomechanical rotator cuff repair testing is a more realistic model of the loading conditions experienced by a repaired rotator cuff as the patient participates in postoperative rehabilitation. Double-row repair has better fixation strength than single-row repairs when exposed to cyclic loading and changes in humeral rotation position. Clinical Relevance: Humeral rotation affects rotator cuff fixation and should be considered in postoperative rehabilitation.

A novel anterior approach for the fixation of ulnar coronoid process fractures	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Elbow; Coronoid process; Fracture; Anterior approach; Space between nerves and blood vessels; Internal fixation	RADIAL HEAD; ELBOW DISLOCATIONS; STABILITY	Background: There is no universally accepted approach to the elbow for the fixation of coronoid process fractures. This study aims to introduce a novel anterior surgical approach for the fixation of the ulnar coronoid fracture, with minimal surgical dissection damage and excellent visualization for reduction and internal fixation. Hypothesis: The anterior approach can facilitate satisfactory outcomes for coronoid process fractures. Material and methods: From February 2010 to July 2014, 12 patients (8 males and 4 females; range 14-62 years; mean age 31 years) with a closed fracture of the coronoid process of the ulna were included in this study. According to Adams classification, we included 5 type II, 3 type III, 3 type IV AM, and 1 type IV AL. The fractures were treated operatively via an anterior approach between nerves and blood vessels. The anatomical reduction and fixation with cannulated screws or a mini plate was easily performed. One elbow showed significant joint instability, necessitating, another incision to repair the lateral collateral ligament, and a subsequent operation with a hinged external fixator was required. The remaining patients received a splint for 2 weeks followed by functional exercises. Results: Mean follow-up was 21 months (13-36). Fracture union was achieved in each patient. The arc of elbow flexion and extension were (135 +/- 15)degrees, and forearm pronation/supination were restored to (165 +/- 15)degrees. When compared with the normal side, there was no significant difference in the functional outcome (P > 0.05). According to Morrey' scale, the functional recovery of the injured arms was assessed as excellent in eleven patients and good in one. Mild heterotopic ossification was found in one case, which had not impaired the elbow function. No other complications were noted.

We hypothesized that transosseous repair is sufficient to effectively stabilize the glenoid fracture. The primary objective was to define the mechanical properties of transosseous repair of an Ideberg IA fracture relative to an intact shoulder (control group). The secondary objective was to determine the contribution of supplemental anteroposterior screw fixation of the bone fragment. Materials and methods: Fifteen fresh cadaver shoulders were divided into two groups: 5 specimens in the control group and 10 in the fracture fixation group, with sequential performance of transosseous repair followed by transosseous repair + screw fixation. A fracture at the inferior portion involving more than 30% of the glenoid's surface area was made. Results: The load to failure was 457 N in the control group, 277 N in the transosseous repair group and 325 N in the transosseous repair + screw fixation group. The stiffness of the constructs was 26.2 N/mm for the control group, 14.6 N/mm for transosseous repair and 24.6 N/mm for transosseous repair + screw fixation. The difference between the two repair techniques was significant for the load to failure (p = 0.02) and stiffness (p = 0.001). Discussion/Conclusion: This study showed that transosseous repair restores the shoulder's anatomy but not the mechanical strength of the native glenoid. Adding screw fixation significantly improves the construct. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The retrospective study included 87 patients (50 men, 37 women), who needed maxillofacial surgery. We examined the proportion of complications and their factors from clinical data. A comparison was also made for plate decomposition using the molecular weight of the plate without plate exposure and complications. Osteosynthesis sites healed in all patients. Ten cases (11.5%) showed plate exposure-related complications, with all occurring at intraoral surgical sites. There was no significant difference in molecular weight changes of plates in resorbable process. Statistical analysis of study variables between patients with and without exposed plates showed that the plate thickness was significantly associated with the risk of exposed plates (p<0.05). The commercially available PLLA/PGA device could be a useful rapid resorbable material for maxillofacial osteosynthesis. When thick plates are used on the intraoral site, it may be necessary to pay attention to the complication of plate exposure. Even if exposure-related complications have occurred, resorption and degradation of this material proceeds, suggesting the ease of appropriate risk management.

J	Singh, AK; Rastogi, A; Singh, V				Singh, Ashutosh Kumar; Rastogi, Amit; Singh, Vakil			Biomechanical comparison of dynamic condylar screw and locking compression plate fixation in unstable distal femoral fractures: An <i>in vitro</i> study	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Biomechanical comparison; distal femoral locking plate; dynamic condylar screw; unstable distal femur fractures	SUPRACONDYLAR INTRAMEDULLARY NAIL; INVASIVE STABILIZATION SYSTEM; INTERNAL-FIXATION; BLADE PLATE; FEMUR; EPIDEMIOLOGY; BONE	Background: Distal femur fractures are difficult to manage and the selection of implant for internal fixation remains controversial. The objective of this study is to establish the relative strength of fixation of a distal femoral locking plate (DFLP) compared with the dynamic condylar screw (DCS) in the distal femur fractures. Materials and Methods: Study was conducted on 16 freshly harvested cadaveric distal femoral specimens, eight implanted with DCS and other eight with DFLP. The construct was made unstable by removing a standard sized medial wedge of 1 cm base (gap-osteotomy) beginning 6 cm proximal to the lateral joint line in distal metaphyseal region with the loss of medial buttress. Fatigue test was conducted under load control mode at the frequency of I Hz. Specimens were subjected to cyclic loading of 2 kN, under observation for 50,000 cycles or until failure/cutout, which ever occurred earlier. Results: In DFLP group, there was no implant failure and the average number of cycles sustained was 50,000. Six out of eight specimens completed 50,000 cycles and two failed in DCS group. The average number of cycles sustained by DCS was 46150. Though the bone quality as assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry DEXA was comparable in both DFLP and DCS group (P = 0.06), none failed in DFLP group and subsidence was 1.02 +/- 0.34 mm (range: 0.60-1.32 mm), which was significantly 43% lower (P = 0.006) than subsidence in DCS group (1.82 +/- 0.58; range: 1.20-3.08 mm). The average stiffness of DCS group was 52.8 +/- 4.2 N/mm, which was significantly lower than average stiffness of locked condylar plate group (71.2 +/- 5.1 N/mm) (P = 0.02). Conclusions: DFLP fixation of the distal femur fractures resulted in stronger construct than the DCS fixation in both cyclic loading and ultimate strength in biomechanical testing of a simulated A3 distal femur fracture.

This study evaluated optimum stability of different screw techniques for condylar head fractures (CHF) (P close to an M fracture with the lateral pole preserved according to AO classification 2014) by finite element analysis (FEA) and provided a biomechanical basis for clinical treatment. Study Design. Four CHF fixation models were evaluated: (A) single bicortical screw, (B) 2 bicortical screws, (C) 1 bicortical screw and 1 monocortical screw (used as a positional screw) inserted via a 2-hole titanium plate, and (D) 2 bicortical screws inserted via a titanium plate. Stresses were calculated (FEA) to measure mechanical properties. Results. The displacement for A and C was larger than for B and D. The maximum stress on the screws for A and C exceeded their breaking limit but was safe for B and D. The stress on the titanium plate for C and D was safe. The stress on bone for A and C was larger than for B and D. Conclusions. The 2 bicortical screw fixation reduced the stress on implanted materials and surrounding bone tissue. Titanium plates further alleviated the lever action. Two bicortical screw fixation was more reliable for CHF, and early postoperative loading and functional training can be expected.

Management of acute combination atlas-axis fractures with percutaneous triple anterior screw fixation in elderly patients	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Percutaneous; ORIF; Minimally invasive; Atlanto-axial fracture; Upper cervical fracture; Elderly	CERVICAL-SPINE INJURIES; ODONTOID FRACTURES; OLDER	Introduction: Patients with combined C1-2 fractures were often treated by posterior arthrodesis. However, elderly patients with multiple injuries (such as brain injury), the large surgical trauma of posterior arthrodesis will increase the risk of perioperative mortality. A minimally invasive technique may be better for them, and decrease the risk of perioperative mortality. Materials and methods: Seven patients with combined C1-2 fractures underwent percutaneous anterior odontoid screw and anterior C1-2 transarticular screws (percutaneous triple anterior screws fixation). The surgical technique of percutaneous triple anterior screws fixation is described. Results: The operation performed on all patients successfully without technical difficulties, and no intra-operative surgery-related complications such as vertebral artery, nerve injury and soft tissue complications occurred. No pullout, loosening, or breakage of internal screws was observed. C1/2 stable was found in all cases and radiographic union achieved in all odontoid fractures. Conclusion: Using the appropriate instruments allied to intra-operative image-intensification, we suggest that percutaneous triple anterior screw fixation is reliable, effective and minimally invasive procedure for elderly and brain injured patients suffering of combined atlas-axis fractures.

Materials and Methods: Forty polyurethane mandible replicas (Nacional, Jau, SP, Brazil) were used. These were divided into 4 groups of different fixation methods: group 1P, 1 2.0-mm miniplate; group 2PLL, 2 2.0-mm parallel miniplates; group 2PERP, 2 2.0-mm perpendicular miniplates; and group LST, 2 2.0-mm lag screws. Each group was subjected to linear vertical loading in the molar region in an Instron 4411 servohydraulic mechanical testing unit (Instron Corporation, Norwood, MA). The load resistance values were measured at load application displacements of 1, 3, 5, and 10 mm. Means and standard deviations were compared with respect to statistical significance using analysis of variance (P < .05) and compared by the Tukey test. Results: Group 1P showed the lowest peak load scores compared with other fixation methods. Group LST showed a statistically significant higher resistance than group 2PLL for all displacements. Group 2PERP showed lower resistance than group LST when displacements were 1 and 3 mm and statically significant similarity at displacements of 5 and 10 mm. However, group 2PERP showed no statistically significant differences compared with group 2PLL. Conclusions: The LST showed better mechanical behavior for symphysis fracture fixation than the other systems when the fixation methods were subjected to linear vertical loading in the molar region.

Biomechanical Evaluation of Transverse Patella Fracture Fixation Using Headless Screws: A Comparison of Suture Versus Cable as a Tension Band	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC TRAUMA			English	Article						patella fracture; headless screws; interfragmentary motion; biomechanics	INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION	Objectives:To explore the performance of headless screws with FiberWire Suture as a tension band and headless screws with a mini-cable tension band in patella fixation.Methods:A transverse osteotomy was created in 6 matched pairs of fresh-frozen cadaver knee joints. One knee was randomly assigned to receive fixation with headless screws plus a cable tension band while the other was fixed with headless screws plus a suture tension band. Using a servo-hydraulic material testing system, the specimens were first tested nondestructively under 20% of the reported mean failure load with a standard technique of cannulated screws with tension band wiring. The specimen was then loaded to 1000 N to test the construct's failure strength. All tests were run under displacement-control with loading threshold. A motion analysis system was used to track the interfragmentary motion to assess fixation stability.Results:In the nondestructive loading test, gap displacement under 150 N was 0.10 mm or less for 11 of 12 specimens, and the difference between the 2 groups was not statistically significant. In the destructive test, 3 of 12 specimens maintained reduction (gap <2 mm) at the maximum load of 1000 N. Of the failed specimens, the mean strength was 648 +/- 185 N for suture and 784 +/- 228 N for cable.Conclusions:There was no significant difference in fixation strength or subfailure fragment displacement between the suture and cable tension band techniques when using headless screws.

Non-setting, injectable biomaterials containing particulate hydroxyapatite can increase primary stability of bone screws in cancellous bone	CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS			English	Article						Weak bone quality; Screw augmentation; Soft material; Hydrogel; Primary stability; Osteoporosis	FEMORAL-NECK FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; PULLOUT STRENGTH; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; AUGMENTATION; BISPHOSPHONATE; FRAGILITY; IMPLANTS; CEMENT; TORQUE	Background: Fracture fixation in weak bone is still a clinical challenge. Screw augmentation was shown to successfully increase their primary stability. The currently used calcium phosphate or polymeric bone cements, however, present important drawbacks such as induced toxicity and/or impaired bone neo-formation. A new approach to enhance bone screw primary stability without affecting bone formation is the use of non-setting, calcitim phosphate loaded soft materials as the augmentation material. Methods: Two types of biomaterials (non-crosslinked hyaluronic acid as viscous fluid and agar as hydrogel) were loaded with 40 wt/vol% of hydroxyapatite particles and characterized. The screw augmentation effect of all materials was evaluated through pull-out tests in bovine cancellous bone and compared to the non-augmented situation (control). The bone mineral density of each test sample was measured with CT scans and was used to normalize the pull-out strength. Findings: Both materials loaded with hydroxyapatite increased the normalized pull-out strength of the screws compared to control samples and particle-free materials. This counter-intuitive augmentation effect increased with decreasing bone mineral density and was independent from the type of the soft materials used. Interpretation: We were able to demonstrate that non-setting, injectable biomaterials loaded with ceramic particles can significantly enhance the primary stability of bone screws. This material combination opens the unique possibility to achieve a screw augmentation effect without impairing or even potentially favoring the bone formation in proximity to the screw. This effect would be particularly advantageous for the treatment of osteoporotic bone fractures requiring a stabilization with bone screws.

J	Dzupa, V; Bartonicek, J; Zidka, M				Dzupa, V; Bartonicek, J; Zidka, M			Fracture of the clavicle after surgical treatment for congenital pseudarthrosis	MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR			English	Article						congenital pseudarthrosis of the clavicle; post-surgical complications; internal fixation	PSEUDARTHROSIS; CHILDHOOD	Background : Congenital pseudarthrosis of the clavicle is a rare disease. There are about 200 individual cases reported so far in world literature, mainly in the form of case reports. The majority of authors recommend surgical. An analysis of 103 cases published since 1980 shows only a few post-surgical complications. Case Report : The authors present a female patient operated at the age of 4.5 years. During surgery both cartilaginous ends were resected and internal fixation was performed by a one-third semi-tubular plate fixed by 3.5 mm cortical screws. Ten days after hardware removal, a fracture occurred in the screw-hole following a minor impact. Surgery to heal the congenital pseudarthrosis was successful, but a new fracture occurred, resulting from bone weakening. This simple fracture was treated conservatively. At present (5 years after the first surgery) the patient's parents are completely satisfied with both the functional result and the cosmetic appearance. Conclusions : The authors have not found in the literature any reports of similar complications after surgical treatment of this condition. The use of more delicate osteosynthetic material might prevent the complication described here.

There are no specific details available on how to address this problem. We present our two-tension-band technique for fixing patellar fractures. Material/Methods: Between March 2010 and March 2013, 4 men and 2 women with failed fixation patellar fractures were treated in our department. Their average age was 34 years (range 23-49 years). The initial fracture type was C1 in 3, C2 in 1, and C3 in 2, according to the AO classification. The initial fracture patterns included 3 transverse and 3 comminuted fractures. There were no open fractures. All patients underwent internal fixation with a modified anterior tension band (MATB) supplemented with cerclage wiring. All failures were caused by tension bands sliding past the tip of the Kirschner wires. The mean time between the primary and revision operations was 16.2 months (range 2-63 months). We revised the fractures by two-separate-tension-band technique. Results: The mean follow-up was 52 months (range 31-67 months). All patients healed radiographically without complications at an average of 14.7 weeks (range 8-20 weeks). The Bostman knee score was excellent in 3 and good in 3. All patients regained full extension and the mean range of flexion was 147.5 degrees (135-155 degrees). Conclusions: Use of this two-tension-band technique can avoid technical errors and provide more secure fixation. We recommend it for both primary and revision surgery of patellar fractures.

On the other hand, there is a potential for clinical problems related to iliac fixation, including late sacroiliac joint arthritis and pain. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients were evaluated. Degenerative scoliosis was diagnosed in 7 patients, failed back syndrome in 6 patients, destructive spondyloarthropathy in 4 patients, and Charcot spine in 3 patients. All patients underwent posterolateral fusion surgery incorporating lumbar, S I and iliac screws. We evaluated the pain scores, bone union, and degeneration of sacroiliac joints by X-ray imaging and computed tomography before and 3 years after surgery. For evaluation of low back and buttock pain from sacroiliac joints 3 years after surgery, lidocaine was administered in order to examine pain relief thereafter. Results: Pain scores significantly improved after surgery. All patients showed bone union at final follow-up. Degeneration of sacroiliac joints was not seen in the 20 patients 3 years after surgery. Patients showed slight low back and buttock pain 3 years after surgery. However, not all patients showed relief of the low back and buttock pain after injection of lidocaine into the sacroiliac joint, indicating that their pain did not originate from sacroiliac joints. Conclusion: The fusion rate and clinical results were excellent. Also, degeneration and pain from sacroiliac joints were not seen within 3 years after surgery. We recommend sacroiliac fixation using iliac screws for highly unstable lumbar spine.

J	Wang, TG; Zhao, B; Yan, J; Shao, B; Mu, WD				Wang, Tingguang; Zhao, Bei; Yan, Jun; Shao, Bin; Mu, Weidong			Finite element analysis of infra-acetabular screw fixation for the treatment of acetabular posterior column fracture	INTERNATIONAL ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Infra-acetabular screw; Finite element analysis; Acetabular posterior column fracture; Internal fixation	ANTERIOR COLUMN; STOPPA APPROACH; PLACEMENT; STRENGTH	Background Infra-acetabular screws have been described to increase the fixation strength of acetabular fractures with separation of the columns. Previous studies were based on the simulation of the anterior column fractures without modelling the biomechanical effect of the screw in the posterior column fractures. The purpose of this study was to compare the stability of different internal fixation models of posterior column fracture and to provide a theoretical basis for the clinical application of infra-acetabular screws. Methods Five internal fixation models of acetabular posterior column fracture were simulated using five implants, including one reconstruction plate (PCP model), one posterior column screw (PCS model), one infra-acetabular screw (PIS model), one infra-acetabular screw and one reconstruction plate (PIS +PCP model), and one infra-acetabular screw and one posterior column screw (PIS +PCS model). After meshing, material parameter, and boundary condition settings, a vertical downward load of 500 N was applied on the surface of the sacrum. To evaluate the biomechanical properties, the stress distribution and von Mises peak stress were recorded and analyzed, and the displacement distributions of the upper and lower fracture surfaces were compared. Results In model PCP, the maximum stress of the plate is 71.952 MPa; in model PCS, the maximum stress of the screw is 52.740 MPa; in model PIS, the maximum stress of the screw is 68.985 MPa; in model PIS +PCP, the maximum stress of the plate is 64.695 MPa and the maximum stress of the screw is 39.679 MPa; and in model PIS +PCS, the maximum stress of the posterior column screw is 48.197 MPa and the maximum stress of the infra-acetabular screw is 65.201 MPa. The maximum stresses of implants are all located on the fracture surfaces. The average displacement differences of the upper and lower fracture surfaces are compared as follows: model PIS +PCS (0.03503 mm)< model PIS +PCP (0.08205 mm)< model PCP (0.10096 mm)< model PCS (0.19007 mm)< model PIS (0.23546 mm). Conclusion With sufficient biomechanical stability, infra-acetabular screws can be used as a supplementary fixation for the treatment of acetabular posterior column fractures. It is recommended to fix the fracture by the combined application of the infra-acetabular screw and posterior column screw.

Plate configurations, with diverse formats and sizes, may be used to surgically resolve condylar fractures. With the purpose of improving the advantages and minimizing the disadvantages of fixation techniques, the neck screw was developed aiming at the needed stabilization to render a correct fixation through a system of dynamic compression. This is achieved by increasing the contact between the fractured bone stumps, as well as assisting at the time of fracture reduction. The present paper aims at comparing the fixation and stability of mandibular condylar fractures using the neck screw and an overlaid "L"-shaped-4-hole-2 mm plate on the one hand, with a system in which the neck screw and the "L"-shaped plate form a single structure, having been joined by a welded point, on the other hand. The results with the neck screw are satisfactory, and, thus, it is an alternative for the reduction and fixation of fractures of the mandibular condyle, whether or not a plate is joined to the structure, provided it is correctly prescribed and with adequate surgical sequence and technique.

The purpose of this study was to compare the biomechanical properties of this new plate with 2 existing volar plates in a cadaver model. Methods: Three different plates were applied on surgically simulated unstable extra-articular distal radius fractures in formalin-fixed cadaver radiuses. Group 1 (volarly placed AO titanium Distal Radius plates [Synthes Ltd, Paoli, PA]; n = 6), group 2 (volarly placed titanium Symmetry plates [DePuy ACE Co, EI Segundo, CA]; n = 6), and group 3 (volarly placed newly designed titanium plates; n = 6) were tested to failure under axial compression with a materials testing machine. Specimens of all 3 groups had similar bone mineral density. Results: Group 3 specimens had significantly greater elastic limit and ultimate strength than the other 2 groups. Specimens of group 3 had the greatest rigidity, although this was statistically insignificant compared with the other 2 groups. All plates (groups 1, 2, 3) failed in apex volar angulation. Conclusions: The newly designed plate fixation system is the strongest of the systems tested and may offer adequate stability for the treatment of a distal radius fracture in which the dorsal and/or volar metaphyseal cortex is comminuted severely.

Material and methods A total of 32 patients with acute comminuted patellar fracture accepted open reduction and internal fixation with the NT-PC, and the curative effects were evaluated using the Bostman clinical grading scale. Results All fractures were anatomically reduced by surgery and all cases were followed-up for six to 18 months. The mean score of patients according to the Bostman clinical grading scale was 25.6, with 29 of 32 (90.7%) patients achieving excellent or good results. Two patients had traumatic arthritis, one had slippage of the NT-PC, and all patients received pharmacotherapy. Conclusions The application of the NT-PC is a satisfactory approach to the treatment of comminuted patellar fractures.

Material and methods: Thirteen patients who had a fracture of the distal clavicle (Neer classification type IIb) were treated with MTBF and CC stabilisation. After the CC stabilisation was performed with a suture anchor or flip button, internal fixation using MTBF was carried out. Each patient was followed up for a minimum of 12 months and their clinical and radiological results were analysed. Results: The mean period required for fracture union was 12.6 (range, 8-24) weeks and union was successfully completed in all cases. The mean Constant score at the final follow-up was 94.7 (88-100); the modified University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder rating scale was 31.3 points (range, 22-35). All patients returned to normal daily activities at an average of 3.7 months postoperatively (range, 3-5 months). One patient had a new fracture around drilled holes for CC stabilisation by inappropriate tunnelling. Conclusion: MTBF and CC stabilisation is a useful technique for treating an unstable distal clavicle fracture. This procedure provides minimal incision and stable fixation without causing any further acromioclavicular joint injury to those with distal clavicle fractures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Materials and Methods: Thirty-two patients were included with twenty-one males and eleven females. The mean age was 41 years (range, 19-76). The mean follow-up period was 51 months (range, 36-73). According to AO-OTA classification, there were 11 cases of B2 injuries, 8 cases of B3 injuries, 9 cases of Cl injuries, 2 cases of C2 injuries and 2 cases of C3 injuries. In the posterior lesions, there were 20 cases of sacral fractures and 12 cases of sacroiliac joint disruptions or dislocations. Anterior pelvic plating and subsequent percutaneous sacroiliac joint fixation were performed. Results: The clinical results were 16 cases of excellent, 10 cases of good, 4 cases of moderate and 2 cases of poor functional results. The 2 cases out of 7 moderate reductions had poor functional results with residual neurologic symptoms. The radiological results were 16 cases of anatomic, 9 cases of nearly anatomic and 7 cases of moderate reduction. All patients were healed except 3 cases of nonunion at the pubic ramus. The complications encountered were 3 cases of screw loosening, 2 cases of anterior plate breakage and 1 case of postoperative infection. Conclusion: In patients with unstable pelvic ring injuries, anterior pelvic plating and subsequent percutaneous sacroiliac joint screw fixation may be a useful surgical option. The radiological results and residual neurologic symptoms had effects on its functional results.

Biomechanical Study of 4-hole Pubic Symphyseal Plating: Locked Versus Unlocked Constructs	ORTHOPEDICS			English	Article							PELVIC RING DISRUPTIONS; INTERNAL-FIXATION; FRACTURES; INJURIES; MANAGEMENT; STABILITY; 2-HOLE	To the authors' knowledge, no published studies have examined the use of locking plates on injuries of the anterior pelvic ring. The purpose of this study was to determine whether locked plates provide enhanced stability in the treatment of pubic symphyseal disruptions. Completely unstable pelvic injuries were simulated in pelvic Sawbones (model 1301; Pacific Research Laboratories, Vashon, Washington) and 2 different fixation constructs used for anterior fixation (4-hole, 3.5-mm pubic symphysis plate with all locked or all unlocked screws). Adjunctive sacroiliac screw fixation with a single 7.3-mm screw placed into S1 was used in all specimens. Specimens were analyzed for motion at the pubic symphysis and sacroiliac joints using a Material Testing System (MTS Systems Corporation, Eden Prairie, Minnesota). Each specimen was subjected to compressive loading in a single-limb stance. Side loading was also examined. The main outcome measurement was motion at the pubic symphysis and sacroiliac joints and overall construct stiffness. No significant difference existed in overall construct stiffness between the 2 methods of pubic symphysis fixation. The motions at the pubic symphysis or injured sacroiliac joints were not significantly different. In addition, motion at the pubic symphysis joint with lateral load was not improved with a locking construct. No significant difference existed between 4-hole locked or unlocked constructs used for fixation of the pubic symphysis. No apparent advantage of locking screws exists for disruptions of the pubic symphysis, and recent reports have questioned the possibility of catastrophic failure.

Evolution of open-wedge high-tibial osteotomy: experience with a special angular stable device for internal fixation without interposition material	INTERNATIONAL ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article							KNEE; OSTEOARTHRITIS; STABILITY	Surgical correction of bowed legs should be performed as early as possible. Overload osteoarthritis, even without significant varus deformity of the knee, is a further indication for open-wedge high-tibial osteotomy. Progression of damage to the joint surfaces due to overloading can be significantly retarded by realigning the extremity with the aim to, at least, reduce overload on the medial compartment to a value close to physiological. Significant improvement to open-wedge high-tibial osteotomy (OWHTO) has been made on two fronts: (a) by the use of a more appropriate surgical technique and (b) by promoting osteogenesis through an angular-stable fixation device with just the correct amount of elasticity. A retrospective study of 53 consecutive cases in which no interposition material was used to fill the wedge, with gap openings between 5 mm and 20 mm, showed that ossification of the gap always progressed from the lateral hinge towards the medial side. Standard radiographs showed 75% of the gap filled in with new bone within 6-18 months. In conclusion, we believe that open-wedge high-tibial osteotomy using the TomoFixA (R) plate has proved to be successful in treating unicompartmental gonarthrosis, even without bone grafts or bone-substitute material.

Flexible implants have attracted attention owing to their high potential for healing bone fractures. In this study, we considered the use of various composite materials such as a flexible phosphate glass fiber/polylactic acid (biodegradable) composite and a carbon/epoxy (WSN3k (non-degradable)) composite for bone plates and estimated the healing performances of bone plates made of said materials by applying them to fractures with gaps of 1-10 mm and oblique angles of 0-35 degrees. The effect of degradation rate on the materials' healing performance was analyzed using ABAQUS 6.10, a software application based on a mechano-regulation algorithm that employs deviatoric strain as a mechanical stimulus. The results showed that the biodegradable composite bone plates had considerably better healing performance. In addition, the most appropriate degradation rates for obtaining the best healing performance for specific bone fracture configurations have been suggested. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To measure the effect of void-filling calcium triphosphate cement on the loads at the implant-bone interface of a proximal humeral fracture osteosynthesis using a finite element analysis. Methods. Finite element models of a 3-part proximal humeral fracture fixed with a plate with and without calcium triphosphate cement augmentation were generated from a quantitative computed tomography dataset of an intact proximal humerus. Material properties were assigned to bone fragments using published expressions relating Young's modulus to local Hounsfield number. Boundary conditions were then applied to the model to replicate the physiological loads. The effect of void-filling calcium triphosphate cement was analysed. Results. When the void was filled with calcium triphosphate cement, the pressure gradient of the bone surrounding the screws in the medial fracture fragment decreased 97% from up to 21.41 to 0.66 MPa. Peak pressure of the fracture planes decreased 95% from 6.10 to 0.30 MPa and occurred along the medial aspect. The mean stress in the screw locking mechanisms decreased 78% from 71.23 to 15.92 MPa. The angled proximal metaphyseal screw had the highest stress. Conclusion. Augmentation with calcium triphosphate cement improves initial stability and reduces stress on the implant-bone interface.

The dog has a history of an internal implant fixation for the right femoral fracture at 5 months ago. Physical examination revealed a dome shape, hard consistency, non-movable, painless, subcutaneous mass with size 5x6 cm. Radiography and ultrasonography showed a well-circumscribed, calcified soft tissue mass at craniolateral aspect of the right proximal femur without cortical bone reaction. Computed tomography (CT) scan was not performed in this case because metal fixation was implanted at the right femur. Cytology was obtained by the fine needle aspiration which revealed numerous transplant unstained granular crystals material with few neutrophils and macrophage. Whereas blood profile revealed normal ranges of serum calcium, phosphorus and parathyroid hormone levels. Surgical excision was subsequently done to remove the calcified mass. On the gross, cross section of the calcified mass revealed variable sizes of chalky-like appearance that accumulated in the dermis and epidermis. In addition, the calcified lesion also extended into the underlying skeletal muscle. The mass was finally diagnosed to be calcinosis circumscripta with the positive staining with Von Koss. After 4 months post-operative monitoring, no evidence of recurrence calcinosis circumscripta at the corrected surgical site.

The aim of this study is to present indications, epidemiological results, difficulties, and complications of implant removal procedure. Materials and methods: Between January and December 2016 all implant removal operations performed in our clinic were evaluated. Localization of the implant, type of the implant, indications of implant removal surgery, interval between fixation and removal surgeries, operation time, incisions, type of anesthesia, difficulties during surgery and complications were listed. Results: A total of 192 patients and 218 implant removal surgeries enrolled in the study. The rate of extended incisions were 17%, the rate of different incisions were 4% for all implant removal surgeries while the others were performed with previous incisions. In children, most common indication for implant removal surgery was age and growing skeleton. Range of motion loss, skin and soft tissue irritation, pain and tenosynovitis were common causes of removal for adults. Complication rate of children was 11% while it was 23% for adults. Bony overgrowth, difficulty of implant accessibility, damaged screw recess, jammed screws and breakage of implants was recorded difficulties during implant removal surgery. Conclusion: Orthopedic implant removal takes a big portion in daily orthopedic practice. Surgeons should be aware of difficulties and complications of this procedure and determine the indications carefully.

A group of 113 patients has been chosen for evaluation, including 100 men and 13 women. After hospitalization, each patient underwent a 6-month postoperative follow-up. The material chosen for the analysis consisted of data collected during the patient's stay in the hospital as well as the postoperative outpatient care. A single 4-hole Delta Condyle Compression Plate (4-DCCP) was used in 90 out of 113 (79.6%) cases. In 16 out of 113 (14.2%) patients, the Trapezoid Condyle Plate (4-TCP or 9-TCP) was used. The remaining cases required more than one miniplate. No 3D miniplate fractures were found in the study subjects during the analyzed observation period. Loosening of one or more osteosynthesis screws was observed in 4 out of 113 (3.5%) patients. Screw loosening was a complication that did not affect bone healing in any of the patient cases. The conducted research confirms that titanium 3D mini-plates are easy to adjust and take up little space, therefore they can easily be used in cases of mandibular condyle base and lower condyle neck fractures. The stability of the three-dimensional miniplates for osteosynthesis gives very good reliability for the rigid fixation of the fractured mandibular condyle.

Of these, 37 cases received radial prosthesis and 35 cases were treated with ORIF. All patients were followed up for 10 to 15.6 months. Results: Based on the elbow functional evaluation criteria score by Broberg and Morrey, 29 cases achieved excellent results, 7 were good, and 1 was fair in the replacement group. In the ORIF group, excellent results were seen in 24 cases, good in 9, and fair in 2. The rates of good or excellent results were 78.4% and 68.6% for prosthesis replacement patients and ORIF patients, respectively (P<0.05). The Visual Analogue Scores (VAS) for replacement and ORIF groups were 2.25 and 1.67, respectively (P<0.05). Conclusions: The radial head prosthesis replacement method is a relatively better surgical approach than ORIF in the treatment of elderly patients with Mason type III radial head fractures.

Surgical treatment and outcomes of extraarticular proximal tibial nonunions	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						proximal tibia; nonunion; Knee Society Rating Scale; functional outcomes	INTERNAL-FIXATION; FRACTURES; MALUNION; REDUCTION	Introduction Although malunion of proximal tibial metaphyseal fractures are not infrequent, nonunion of the proximal tibia is rare. These nonunions can present particular challenges in management, such as malalignment, a short proximal segment, and soft tissue compromise. Few treatment guidelines and long-term outcomes are available. The purpose of this study was to determine the long-term functional outcomes of patients treated with open reduction and internal fixation. Materials and methods Sixteen patients with a proximal tibial nonunion were treated between 1992 and 2005. Five fractures were originally open injuries, but all were aseptic at the time of definitive fixation. All nonunions were treated with a consistent approach of debridement, deformity correction, lateral plating, tensioning and compression, lag screws and bone grafting. Patients were reviewed radiographically and with a Knee Society questionnaire at a mean follow-up of 39 months (range 10-113 months). Results All nonunions healed at an average of 4 months, and alignment was within 5 degrees of anatomic in all cases. Knee Society function and knee scores improved significantly, to 87.4 and 89.4, respectively (P < 0.05 for both). Functional outcomes were excellent overall. Fourteen of the patients (88%) subjectively returned to their previous activities and were satisfied with their result. Conclusions Using an algorithmic approach of debridement, deformity correction, lateral tension band plating with compression, and rigid stabilization, fracture healing and functional outcome can be reliably restored in these difficult fractures.

Biomechanical Properties of Volar Hybrid and Locked Plate Fixation in Distal Radius Fractures	JOURNAL OF HAND SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME			English	Article						Biomechanical; distal radius fracture; hybrid fixation; internal fixation; locking; volar plate	DORSALLY DISPLACED FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; COMPRESSION PLATE; LOCKING SCREW; MODEL; COMPLICATIONS; STABILITY; STRENGTH	Purpose We compare the biomechanical properties of a volar hybrid construct to an all-locking construct in an osteoporotic and normal comminuted distal radius fracture model. Methods Groups of 28 normal, 28 osteoporotic, and 28 over-drilled osteoporotic left distal radius synthetic bones were used. The normal group consisted of synthetic bone with a standard foam core. The osteoporotic group consisted of synthetic bone with decreased foam core density. The over-drilled osteoporotic group consisted of synthetic bone with decreased foam core density and holes drilled with a 2.3 mm drill, instead of the standard 2.0 mm drill, to simulate the lack of purchase in osteoporotic bone. Within each group, 14 synthetic bones were plated with a volar locking plate using an all-locking screw construct, and 14 synthetic bones were plated with a volar locking plate using a hybrid screw construct (ie, both locking and nonlocking screws). A 1-cm dorsal wedge osteotomy was created with the apex 2 cm from the volar surface of the lunate facet. Each specimen was mounted to a materials testing machine, using a custom-built, standardized axial compression jig. Axial compression was delivered at 1 N/s over 3 cycles from 20 N to 100 N to establish stiffness. Each sample was stressed to failure at 1 minis until 5 mm of permanent deformation occurred. Results Our results show no difference in construct stiffness and load at failure between the all-locking and hybrid constructs in the normal, osteoporotic, or over-drilled osteoporotic synthetic bone models. All specimens failed by plate bending at the osteotomy site with loss of height. Clinical Relevance Although volar locking plates are commonly used for the treatment of distal radius fractures, the ideal screw configuration has not been determined. Hybrid fixation has comparable biomechanical properties to all locking constructs in the fixation of metaphyseal fractures about the knee and shoulder and might also have a role in the fixation of distal radius fractures.

There is a lack of information about the outcome and development of posttraumatic osteoarthritis after internal fixation of such fractures at long-term follow-up in skiers.Materials and methodsA population of 83 skiers was followed up in a case series after internal fixation of intra-articular tibial plateau fractures AO-OTA 41 B1-B3 and C1-C3. Functional outcomes Visual Analog Scale, Tegner Activity Scale, Modified Lysholm Score, Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) Knee Score and X-ray images of the affected knees (preoperative, postoperative and at time of follow-up) were obtained. Radiological evaluation focused on severity of osteoarthritis according to the Kellgren and Lawrence score of the lateral, medial and retropatellar knee compartments separately. Subgroup analyses for fracture type and age were performed separately.ResultsPatients age was 49.812.9years (range 19-74years) at the time of surgery, with a mean follow-up period of 10.3 +/- 1.9years (range 6-14years). All tibial plateau fractures affected the lateral compartment, while the medial compartment was affected in addition as part of bicondylar fractures in two cases. Both the Tegener Activity Scale and Lysholm Score decreased significantly during the follow-up period and their median values dropped from 6 (range 3-7) to 5 (range 2-7) and from 100 (range 90-100) to 95 (range 58-100), respectively (both p<.01). The median clinical knee function at the time of follow-up revealed an HSS Knee Score of 96.5 points (range 74-100). Among the whole patient population, the radiological evaluation at follow-up revealed a significantly higher grade of osteoarthritis in all compartments of the knee joint compared to the time of the operation (p<.01). The grade of osteoarthritis in the lateral compartment was significantly higher than that in the medial and retropatellar compartments (p<.01).Conclusions In addition to physiologic aging, progression of radiologic signs of osteoarthritis following internal fixation of intra-articular tibial plateau fractures in an athletic population of skiers is most severe in the lateral knee compartment corresponding to fracture location. However, the long-term functional outcomes seem to be very satisfactory.

The primary objective of this study was to report the functional and anatomical outcomes after screw-plate fixation of displaced mid-shaft clavicular fractures with three or more fragments. Hypothesis: Screw-plate fixation in this indication is an excellent treatment option that minimises the risk of complications. Methods: A search of our database from 6 January 2012 to 27 December 2016 identified 410 cases of clavicular fracture, of which 250 were managed surgically, including 172 meeting our inclusion criteria and having complete data. These 172 patients were managed using a curved pelvic reconstruction plate with 3.5-mm non-locking screws positioned over the antero-superior aspect of the clavicle. All 172 patients were re-evaluated at least 1 year after surgery by an independent assessor, who determined the UCLA score. Results: We studied 172 patients, 154 (89.5%) males and 18 females with a mean age of 34.5 +/- 14.5 years (range, 13-69 years). In 84.5% of cases, the fracture was a sports injury, and the most common sports were skiing (26%), cycling (21%), and mountain biking (18.5%). Of the 172 fractures, all but 1 healed, within a mean of 87 days (range, 45-120 days). After removal of the fixation material, 8 (4.5%) patients experienced a recurrent fracture, within a mean of 90 days (range, 2-210 days); 4 of these recurrent fractures were caused by high-energy traumas occurring 6 months after implant removal. The UCLA score determined at re-evaluation indicated that the outcome was excellent in 164 (95.5%), good in 5 (3%), and fair in 3 patients. Conclusion: Internal fixation using a curved pelvic reconstruction plate fixed with 3.5-mm screws provides excellent functional and anatomical outcomes in patients who have displaced mid-shaft clavicular fractures with three or more fragments.

Materials and methods: A retrospective study of patients surgically treated for mandibular fractures. The primary study variable was the postoperative change in IAN/MN neurosensory examination after fracture fixation. Risk factors were categorized as demographic, anatomic, experience of the operator, fracture displacement and number of miniplates placed at each fracture site. Appropriate statistics were computed. Results: 209 patients with 293 fractures were analysed. One hundred twenty fractures (41%) were located between the lingula and mental foramen, and 173 fractures (59%) were located distal to the mental foramen. Two hundred seventeen (41%) were displaced by 5 mm or more. In 38 fractures (13%), the IAN/MN neurosensory status worsened after treatment. In a multivariate model, fracture displacement, operator inexperience and two plate fixation were associated with a statistically significant risk (P <= 0.05) for postoperative deterioration of IAN/MN sensation. Conclusion: Fixation with two miniplates, fracture displacement of 5 mm or more and operator inexperience were associated with an increased risk for deterioration of the IAN/MN neurosensory status after treatment of mandibular fractures.

Therefore, developing an efficient photocatalyst for N-2 fixation under mild conditions is urgently required. Herein, ferroelectric Bi2WO6 materials with different surface oxygen defects were prepared, and the concentration of corresponding defects was controlled by adjusting the thermal reduction time. The abundant oxygen defects in Bi2WO6 can provide more reactive sites to promote the effective adsorption of N2, and the photogenerated charge carrier can be efficiently separated benefiting from the internal electric field. These would weaken the N-2 triple bond and reduce the activation energy barrier for the conversion of N-2 to NH3 under mild conditions. In the absence of sacrificial agents and cocatalysts, the optimized Bi2WO6 with oxygen defects shows an indigenous NH3 yield of 132.175 mu mol.g(-1).L-1.h(-1), which is more than two times higher than that of the original Bi2WO6. Surprisingly, the Bi2WO6 with oxygen defects produced more than eight times NH3 (471.13 mu mol.g(-1).L-1.h(-1)) than that of the original Bi2WO6 when assisted by an external magnetic field, thus providing a new perspective for further enhancing the N-2 fixation performance.

But the anterior plate-screw fixation of the C2 spine has been the uncommon surgical procedure. In this study, we analyze the anatomy of the C2 body relevant to C2 anterior plate-screw fixation. Material and methods:Eighty-six dried C2 spines were evaluated directly for this study. Measurements were made on the C2 body width and midsagittal anteroposterior (AP) depth and the anteroposterior parasagittal depth 5 mm lateral to midline on the inferior endplates, in addition to on the middle body. Measurements also were made of anteroposterior parasagittal vertebral depth with both medial and lateral inclination of 10 degrees, with respect to the parasagittal plane of the vertebral body. Results: The ideal maximum screw length and trajectory was found to be AP medial parasagittal depth of inferior surface of the C2 body [Right: 13.7 +/- 1.4 mm (11.0-17.9), Left: 13.6 +/- 1.5 mm (10.7-17.8)]. Conclusions: We report the measurements of the vertebral body of the C2. We think these measurements provide guidelines for operating on the anterior C2 spine, and enhance the confidence interval for the surgeon (Tab. 3, Fig. 1, Ref. 24). Full Text in free PDF www.bmj.sk.

Instrumented arthrodesis for non-traumatic craniocervical instability in very young children	CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	AANS/CNS Section-on-Pediatric-Neurological-Surgery Meeting	NOV 28-DEC 01, 2017	Houston, TX	AANS CNS Sect Pediat Neurol Surg		Occipital bone; Cervical spine; Occipitocervical instability; Instrumentation; Occipitocervical fusion	CERVICAL-SPINE INJURIES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; SERONEGATIVE ENTHESOPATHY; OCCIPITOCERVICAL FUSION; ARTHROPATHY SYNDROME; SCREW FIXATION; COMPLICATIONS; OUTCOMES	PurposeOccipitocervical instrumentation is infrequently required for stabilization of the axial and subaxial cervical spine in very young children. However, when it is necessary, unique surgical considerations arise in children when compared with similar procedures in adults.MethodsThe authors reviewed literature describing fusion of the occipitocervical junction (OCJ) in toddlers and share their experience with eight cases of young children (age less than or equal to4years) receiving occiput to axial or subaxial spine instrumentation and fixation. Diagnoses and indications included severe or secondary Chiari malformation, skeletal dysplastic syndromes, Klippel-Feil syndrome, Pierre Robin syndrome, Gordon syndrome, hemivertebra and atlantal occipitalization, basilar impression, and iatrogenic causes.ResultsAll patients underwent occipital bone to cervical spine instrumentation and fixation at different levels. Constructs extended from the occiput to C2 and T1 utilizing various permutations of titanium rods, autologous rib autografts, Mersilene sutures, and combinations of autografts with bone matrix materials. All patients were placed in rigid cervical bracing or halo fixation postoperatively. No postoperative neurological deficits or intraoperative vascular injuries occurred.ConclusionInstrumented arthrodesis can be a treatment option in very young children to address the non-traumatic craniocervical instability while reducing the need for prolonged external halo vest immobilization. Factors affecting fusion are addressed with respect to preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative decision-making that may be unique to the toddler population.	[Janjua, M.

Percutaneous treatment of these complex fractures is intended to reduce soft issue complications and postoperative stiffness of the knee joint. We assessed the complications, clinical outcome scores, and postoperative knee range of movements, after fluoroscopic assisted closed reduction and external fixator application. Materials and Methods: Seventy eight complex tibial plateau fractures in 78 patients were included in the study. All fractures were managed with closed reduction and external fixator application. In 28 cases with intraarticular split, we used percutaneous cancellous screw fixation for reduction and fixation of condylar parts. In nine open fractures, immediate debridement was done. In 16 cases, elevation of depressed segment and bone grafting was required, which was done from a very small incision. All patients were clinically and radiographically evaluated at a mean followup of 26.16 months (range 6-60 months). Results: Clinical results were evaluated according to the Rasmussen's criteria. Average healing time was 13.69 weeks (range 12-28 weeks). Mean knee range of motion was 122.60 degrees ( range 110 degrees-130 degrees). Forty seven results were scored as excellent, 25 good, 2 fair, and 1 as poor. Conclusion: We believe that minimally invasive treatment by percutaneous techniques and external fixation is a fairly reasonable treatment alternative, if near anatomical reduction of joint surface can be confirmed on fluoroscopy.

Electroforming of Powder Composite Materials	POWDER METALLURGY AND METAL CERAMICS			English	Article						electroforming; powder; composite	DEPOSITION	Electrochemical and electrophoretic deposition can be used for electroforming of powder-based composite billets with complex shape and microscopically nonuniform internal structure. Electrophoretic deposition of green bodies for near-net shaping of functionally graded ceramic composites and electroforming of heat sinks for electronic chips are considered as application examples. It is shown that electrophoretic forming allows shaping functionally graded billets to provide near-net-shape components after sintering. Heat sinks made from ceramic foam with copper electroplating provide a combination of high thermal conductivity with low thermal expansion coefficient, which is important for reliable fixation of the radiator on the chip surface.

This report describes a new intramedullary extra-articular Knowles pin fixation method to treat these unstable fractures. Materials and methods: Twelve patients with unstable distal clavicle fractures (Neer type II) had surgery with intramedullary extra-articular Knowles pin fixation. We retrospectively reviewed clinical results for pain, shoulder function, and range of motion, as well as radiographic results, for this institutional review board-approved study. Each patient's operated arm was in a sling for 4 weeks postoperatively. The University of California, Los Angeles shoulder rating scale score was used to evaluate shoulder function. Results: All patients showed radiographically confirmed bony union. The mean period required for healing was 11.5 weeks, and patients were followed up for 6 to 24 months (mean, 15.2 months), during which University of California, Los Angeles scores (mean, 33.9) indicated good clinical results. Three patients had the complication of proximal or distal skin irritation caused by the thread and hub of the Knowles pin. Conclusions: The Knowles pin fixation method is useful for treating unstable distal clavicle fractures. However, sufficient familiarity with the technique and careful preoperative planning to determine the appropriate length of the pin are necessary to prevent complications and to effect a high union rate.

In order to solve the adverse effects of carbon fixation components on the mechanical properties and optimize carbon absorption properties, a specific amount of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is incorporated. In this study, a serial of test was employed to study the production process of nano-modified foam, and some basic properties of the foam concrete of interest. Further, the micromorphology and pore structure of the samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscope and mercury injection test. The evolution of mineral phases was examined by X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. The results show that the carbon sequestration efficiency of foam concrete increases significantly as the amount of calcium hydroxide is increased, however, the cementitious properties of materials deteriorate, resulting in a decrease in strength. When PVA is added as a water-soluble admixture, it can enhance the mechanical properties of test blocks. It can also strengthen the bubble film of nano stabilized foam, increase bubble stability, and refine the internal pore structure of carbon fixation foam concrete. In addition, PVA can modify the calcium hydroxide morphology from a laminar structure to a smaller volume edge corrosion structure, which improves the reaction activity of calcium hydroxide with CO2 and boosts the efficiency of carbon sequestration.

Yet, no biomechanical study has been performed comparing fixation strength of arthroscopic single- (SR) vs. double row (DR) fixation. Methods: Standardized fractures of the greater tuberosity were created in 12 fresh frozen proximal humeri. After random assignation to the SR or DR group the fixed humeri were tested applying cyclic loading to the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendon. Load to failure and fragment displacement were assessed by means of an electrodynamic material testing machine using an optical tracking system. Results: Load to failure values were higher in the DR group (649 N; +/- 176) than in the SR group (490 N; +/- 145) however without statistical significance (p = .12). In greater tuberosity displacement of 3-5 mm surgical treatment is recommended. The fixing constructs in this study did not reach displacement landmarks of 3 or 5 mm before construct failure as shown in previous studies. Thus the applied traction force (N) at 1 mm displacement was analyzed. In the SR group the load at 1 mm displacement was 277 N; +/- 46 compared to 260 N; +/- 62 in the DR group (p = .65). Conclusion: The results suggest that both techniques are viable options for refixation of greater tuberosity fractures.

One in Three of Pediatric Tibia Shaft Fractures is Currently Treated Operatively: A 6-Year Epidemiological Study in two University Hospitals in Finland Treatment of Pediatric Tibia Shaft Fractures	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article						Acute care; fracture; tibia fracture; pediatric surgery; pediatric traumatology; conservative treatment; operative treatment	INTACT FIBULA; CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS; POPULATION; MANAGEMENT; FIXATION	Background: Internal fixation of pediatric tibia shaft fractures has become increasingly popular despite the fact that non-operative treatment results in satisfactory outcome with few exceptions. Indications for surgery and benefits of internal fixation are however still debatable. Materials and Methods: All 296 less than 16-year-old patients treated for a tibia shaft fracture between 2010 and 2015 in two of the five university hospitals in Finland were included in the study. Patient data were analyzed in three treatment groups: cast immobilization in emergency department, manipulation under anesthesia, and operative treatment. Incidence of operative treatment of pediatric tibia shaft fractures was calculated in the cities of Helsinki and Kuopio. Results: A total of 143 (47.3%) children's tibia shaft fractures were treated with casting in emergency department, 71 (22.3%) with manipulation under anesthesia, and 82 (30.4%) with surgery. Mean age of the patients in these treatment groups was 6.2, 8.7, and 12.7 years. Fibula was intact in 89%, 51%, and 27% of the patients, respectively. All 6 patients with multiple fractures and 16 of 18 patients with open fractures were treated operatively. In eight patients, primary non-operative treatment was converted to internal fixation. Operatively treated patients with isolated closed fractures were more likely to have a fibula fracture (46/66 vs 52/214, p < 0.001), be older in age (13.08 2.4 vs 6.4 +/- 3.7, p < 0.001), and have more primary angulation (6.9 +/- 5.8 vs 0.48 +/- 3.1, p < 0.001). Re-operations were done to eight and corrective osteotomy to two operatively treated children. Conclusion: Operative treatment of a pediatric tibia shaft fracture is currently nearly a rule in patients with open or multiple fractures. Surgical treatment of closed tibia shaft fractures is based on surgeon's personal preference, type of fracture and age of the patient.

Currently, the most indicated treatment for facial fractures is anatomical reduction and internal fixation, however, this procedure is not exempt from complications, such as infection and exposure of osteosynthesis material, thus requiring a new surgical procedure and repair. In this study, the authors describe a case of a 60-year-old woman who was the victim of a motorcycle accident and developed exposure of osteosynthesis material on the nasal dorsum after treatment of facial fractures. The patient underwent surgical treatment with objective of removing the osteosynthesis material and associated infected tissue, as well as reconstruction using a paramedian frontal flap, which resulted in a harmonic relationship and skin color similar to the recipient area. This case shows the importance of anatomical knowledge and reconstructive techniques for hard and soft tissues.

Antegrade or retrograde screw fixation along the long axis of the posterior column of the acetabulum is increasingly applied in surgical practice. While there is sufficient justification in the literature for the application of the anterior approach, there is a deficit of reports related to the posterior approach. The aim of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical competence of posterior column acetabulum fracture fixation through antegrade screw placement using either a standard cannulated screw or a cannulated compression headless screw (CCHS) via posterior approach. Materials and Methods: Eight composite pelvises were used, and a posterior column acetabulum fracture according to the Letournel Classification was simulated on both their left and right sides via an osteotomy. The sixteen hemi-pelvic specimens were assigned to two groups (n = 8) for either posterior column standard screw (group PCSS) or posterior column CCHS (group PCCH) fixation. Biomechanical testing was performed by applying steadily increased cyclic load until failure. Interfragmentary movements were investigated by means of motion tracking. Results: Initial stiffness demonstrated significantly higher values in PCCH (163.1 & PLUSMN; 14.9 N/mm) versus PCSS (133.1 & PLUSMN; 27.5 N/mm), p = 0.024. Similarly, cycles and load at failure were significantly higher in PCCH (7176.7 & PLUSMN; 2057.0 and 917.7 & PLUSMN; 205.7 N) versus PCSS (3661.8 & PLUSMN; 1664.5 and 566.2 & PLUSMN; 166.5 N), p = 0.002. Conclusion: From a biomechanical perspective, CCHS fixation demonstrates superior stability and could be a valuable alternative option to the standard cannulated screw fixation of posterior column acetabulum fractures, thus increasing the confidence in postoperative full weight bearing for both the patient and treating surgeon. Whether uneventful immediate postoperative full weight bearing can be achieved with CCHS fixation should primarily be investigated in further human cadaveric studies with a larger sample size.

Treatment of the Refractory Atrophic Humeral Nonunion with Autogenous Block Iliac Crest Graft and Spongioplasty: a Retrospective Study	ACTA CHIRURGIAE ORTHOPAEDICAE ET TRAUMATOLOGIAE CECHOSLOVACA			English	Article						block graft; bone grafting; nonunion; refractory humeral nonunion; spongioplasty	SHAFT NONUNION; BONE-GRAFT; PSEUDARTHROSIS; FRACTURES; FIXATION	PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Most humeral nonunions can be successfully treated with a single procedure, but some are more difficult to heal. Humeral nonunions which have two or more surgical procedures were defined as refractory humeral nonunions, and this condition is a very challenging condition. The aim of the study is to show the results of atrophic refractory humeral nonunion treated with open reduction and internal fixation and autogenous block iliac crest graft and spongioplasty. MATERIAL AND METHODS Refractory humeral nonunions treated with open reduction and internal fixation and autogenous block iliac crest graft and spongioplasty from January 2010 to March 2019 were included this study retrospectively. Patient baseline information, number of previous surgeries, comorbidities, follow-up time, fracture union time, and complications were recorded. The functional outcome was evaluated with the Constant scores and Mayo scores at the end of the first year. The primary outcome variable was mentioned as bony union. RESULTS A total of 13 refractory humeral nonunions included this study. The average age of the patients was 50.92 +/- 15.55 years (range, 26-78 years). and 8 of them were female. Preoperative and postoperative mean Mayo scores were; 56.54 +/- 17.84, and 85.38 +/- 7.49 respectively (p<0.001). Preoperative and postoperative mean Constant scores were; 45 +/- 11.71, and 80.62 +/- 5.38 respectively (p<0.001). DISCUSSION The strict application of basic nonunion principles can result in successful salvage of refractory humeral nonunions. But this concept may not provide sufficient solution for each situation. On the other hand, we also applied the basic nonunion principles. Compression plating and autogenous bone grafting and spongioplasty have been considered as the gold standard in the management of humeral shaft nonunion. CONCLUSIONS Open reduction and internal fixation and autogenous block iliac crest graft and spongioplasty should be considered as an alternative for the treatment of refractory atrophic humeral nonunions, whose treatment is a very challenging condition for surgeons.

This retrospective study reports on a series of 127 patients. Material and methods Our clinical database was screened for patients with fractures of the upper cervical spine incorporating a C2 fracture, operated on between 2007 and 2015. Patients were included if fused by internal fixation via C1 lateral mass screws, C2 isthmic screws in freehand technique under lateral fluoroscopy. Screw placement was controlled postoperatively by computed tomography and rated using the Gertzbein & Robbins classification. Surgery-related complications, consecutive treatment, revision surgeries and duration of surgeries were registered. Results In total, 127 patients were identified with altogether 572 screws. Correct screw positions of grade A and B according to Gertzbein & Robbins were achieved in a total of 539 (94.2%) screws (grade A: 453 (79.2%); grade B: 86 (15%)), grade C screw malpositions noted in 21 (3.7%), grade D in 10 (1.7%) and grade E in 2 (0.3%) screws. Vertebral artery canal breaches occurred in 29 screws (5.1%), with vertebral artery occlusion in 4 patients. Coiling of injured vertebral artery had to be performed in one patient. None of these patients suffered clinically apparent cerebrovascular complications. Revision surgery was performed in 8 patients (6%). Conclusion Posterior fixation of atlantoaxial fractures by C1 lateral mass and C2 isthmic screws with fluoroscopy without navigation is a safe and feasible method but not free of risk of vertebral artery injuries.

This study was done to assess its feasibility and early clinical outcome. Materials and methods: Patients with isolated PHF in 2014 and 2015 were included in this prospective study. The quality of life (EQ-5D) and the level of autonomy before injury were recorded. The fractures were classified and local bone quality was measured. When possible, patients were treated according to the algorithm. Radiographic and clinical follow-up-Constant score, subjective shoulder value, and EQ-5D-took place after 3 months and 1 year. The rate of unplanned surgery was analyzed. Results: A total of 192 patients (mean age 66 years; 58 male, 134 female) were included. Of these, 160 (83%) were treated according to the algorithm. In total, 132 patients were treated conservatively, 36 with open reduction and internal fixation and 24 with reverse total shoulder arthroplasty or hemiarthroplasty. Generally, the mean EQ-5D before trauma and 1 year after treatment was equal to 0.88 to 0.9 points. After 1 year, the overall mean relative Constant score was 95% and mean subjective shoulder value 84%. Unplanned surgery was necessary in 21 patients. Conclusion: This comprehensive algorithm is designed as a noncompulsory treatment guideline for PHF, which prioritize the patient's demands and biology. The high adherence proves that it is a helpful tool for decision making. Furthermore, this algorithm leads to very satisfying overall results with low complication and revision rates.

Materials and methods A retrospective analysis was performed on 48 patients with lower cervical tuberculosis admitted to multiple medical centers from June 2018 to June 2021. Among them, 36 patients had lesions involving two vertebrae and 12 patients had lesions involving more than three vertebrae. All patients were treated with quadruple antituberculosis drugs for more than 2 weeks before the operation, and then treated with one-stage anterior debridement and autogenous iliac bone graft fusion combined with titanium plate internal fixation. After the operation, antituberculosis drugs were continued for 12-18 months. The patients were followed-up to observe the improvement in clinical symptoms, bone graft fusion, Cobb angle, visual analog score ( VAS), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), wound healing, and neurological function. Results The patients were followed-up for 13-43 months, with an average of 21.46 +/- 1.52 months. The clinical symptoms significantly improved after the operation. The bone graft was completely fused in all patients, and the bone fusion time was 3-6 months, with an average of 4.16 +/- 0.47 months. At the last follow-up, the Cobb angle, VAS, ESR, and CRP level were significantly lower than those before surgery (P < 0.05). None of the patients had loosening, detachment, or rupture of the internal fixation, and no recurrence occurred. All surgical incisions healed in one stage without infection or sinus formation. The preoperative Frankel neurological function classification was grade B in 7 cases, grade C in 13, grade D in 18, and grade E in 10. At the last follow-up, 8 cases recovered to grade D and 40 recovered to grade E.

In this study, to allow X-ray visibility, we separately prepared a radiopaque layer and attached it to a bioabsorbable bone plate approved for clinical use (Inion, Finland). We employed barium sulfate as a radiopaque material due to the high X-ray attenuation coefficient of barium (2.196 cm(2)/g). The radiopaque layer was composed of a fine powder of barium sulfate bound to a biodegradable material, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), to allow layer degradation similar to the original Inion bone plate. In this study, we varied the mass ratio of barium sulfate and PLGA in the layer between 3:1 w/w and 10:1 w/w to modulate the degree and longevity of X-ray visibility. All radiopaque plates herein were visible via X-ray, both in vitro and in vivo, for up to 40 days. For all layer types, the radio-opacity decreased with time due to the swelling and degradation of PLGA, and the change in the layer shape was more apparent for layers with a higher PLGA content. The radiopaque plates released, at most, 0.5 mg of barium sulfate every 2 days in a simulated in vitro environment, which did not appear to affect the cytotoxicity. The radiopaque plates also exhibited good biocompatibility, similar to that of the Inion plate. Therefore, we concluded that the barium sulfate-based, biodegradable plate prepared in this work has the potential to be used as a fixation device with both X-ray visibility and biocompatibility.

The aim of this multicenter study was to obtain a representative data set of patients with isolated Hoffa fractures with special emphasis on concomitant soft tissue injuries, diagnostic algorithms, treatment strategies and functional outcomes.Materials and methodsParticipating Level I trauma centres were asked to review their internal database for isolated Hoffa fractures treated surgically between 2010 and 2020. Demographics, mechanism of injury, diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm, Letenneur classification, concomitant soft tissue injuries, and postoperative knee function and complications were analysed.ResultsA total of 56 patients from six participating trauma centres were included. The median age at injury was 45 years (15-94) with a median follow-up of 19 months (2-108). The most common mechanism of injury was high-energy trauma, with unicondylar lateral Letenneur type I and II fractures being the most common. Surgical treatment was independent of the type of fracture and included isolated screw fixation, combined plate and screw fixation and isolated plate osteosynthesis. Isolated screw fixation resulted in significantly better range of motion (ROM) values (p = 0.032), but the highest number of postoperative complications (n = 14/20, n.s.) compared to the other fixation techniques. The highest number of fixation failures requiring revision was observed in the plate and screw fixation group (n = 3/8, p = 0.008). Osteochondral flake fractures (n = 12/43, 27%) and lateral meniscus injuries (n = 5/49, 10%) were commonly seen in Hoffa fractures.ConclusionsTreatment of Hoffa fractures with screw fixation resulted in significantly better functional outcomes, probably due to less comminuted fractures. Concomitant cartilage, meniscal and ligamentous injuries are common and warrant preoperative recognition and management.	[Neumann-Langen, M.

A cadaveric biomechanical study	BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS			English	Article						Biomechanical study; Distal humeral fracture; Fracture fixation; Comminuted fracture; Parallel plating; Posterior plating	HETEROTOPIC OSSIFICATION; INTERNAL-FIXATION; PLATING SYSTEMS; RISK-FACTORS; LOCKING; PLATES; ELBOW; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; DORSAL	BackgroundThe posterior plating technique could be used as a clinical alternative to parallel plating for treating comminuted distal humerus fractures (DHFs) successfully with good clinical results. However, the biomechanical characteristics for posterior fixation are still unclear. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the biomechanical properties of the posterior fixation and to make comparisons between the parallel and the posterior fixation systems.Materials and methodsWe performed a cadaveric biomechanical testing with two posterior plating systems (a posterior two plating and a single posterior pre-contoured Y plating system) and one parallel two plating system to treat AO/OTA type-C2.3 DHFs. Among three groups, we compared construct stiffness, failure strength, and intercondylar width changes after 5000-cycle fatigue loading and failure loads and failure modes after destructive tests in both the axial compression and (sagittal) posterior bending directions. The correlations between construct failure loads and bone marrow density (BMD) were also compared.ResultsIn axial direction, there were no significant differences in the stiffness and failure load between the posterior and the parallel constructs. However, in sagittal direction, the two-plate groups (posterior two plating and parallel plating group) had significant higher stiffness and failure loads than the one-plate group (single posterior Y plating). There was no fixation failure after 5000-cyclic loading in both directions for all groups. Positive correlation was noted between BMD and failure loads on parallel fixation.ConclusionsWe found that when using two plates for treating comminuted DHFs, there were no significant differences in terms of most biomechanical measurements between posterior and parallel fixation. However, the single pre-contoured posterior Y plate construct was biomechanically weaker in the sagittal plane than the parallel and the posterior two-plate constructs, although there was no fixation failure after the fatigue test for all groups regardless of the fixation methods.Level of evidenceBiomechanical study	[Shih, Chien-An; Kuan, Fa-Chuan; Hsu, Kai-Lan; Yeh, Ming-Long] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Tainan, Taiwan; [Shih, Chien-An; Kuan, Fa-Chuan; Hsu, Kai-Lan; Hong, Chih-Kai; Lin, Cheng-Li; Su, Wei-Ren] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Natl Cheng Kung Univ Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Coll Med, Tainan, Taiwan; [Shih, Chien-An; Kuan, Fa-Chuan; Hsu, Kai-Lan; Hong, Chih-Kai; Lin, Cheng-Li; Su, Wei-Ren] Natl Cheng Kung Univ Hosp, Med Device R&D Core Lab, Tainan, Taiwan; [Kuan, Fa-Chuan] Natl Cheng Kung Univ Hosp, Dept Orthoped, Dou Liou Branch, Tainan, Taiwan; [Yeh, Ming-Long; Su, Wei-Ren] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Med Device Innovat Ctr, Tainan, Taiwan	National Cheng Kung University; National Cheng Kung University; National Cheng Kung University Hospital; National Cheng Kung University; National Cheng Kung University Hospital; National Cheng Kung University; National Cheng Kung University Hospital; National Cheng Kung University	Su, WR (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Natl Cheng Kung Univ Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Coll Med, Tainan, Taiwan.; Su, WR (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ Hosp, Med Device R&D Core Lab, Tainan, Taiwan.	suwr@ms28.hinet.net	Shih, Chien-An/AAC-4419-2022; Lin, Cheng-Li/AAU-1138-2021; su, wei/GZM-3986-2022	Su, Wei-Ren/0000-0002-6133-3584; Shih, Chien-An/0000-0002-5520-5623	National Cheng Kung University Hospital [NCKUH-10705022, NCKUH-10904019, NCKUH-11005004]	National Cheng Kung University Hospital	We thank National Cheng Kung University Hospital for funding this work (grants: NCKUH-10705022; NCKUH-10904019; NCKUH-11005004).		38	3	3	0	6	BMC	LONDON	CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND		1471-2474		BMC MUSCULOSKEL DIS	BMC Musculoskelet.

However, there are currently no studies concerning clinical and radiological outcomes of patients treated using these proximal femoral nails (PFNs) that have been performed in the Japanese population. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the clinical outcomes associated with 235 to 240 mm PFNs for Japanese patients >70 years old with trochanteric hip fractures who could walk independently before the injury. Materials and Methods: This study involved a retrospective analysis of data on trochanteric hip fracture patients who had undergone internal fixation from March 2016 to June 2018. The inclusion criteria were patients >70 years old with trochanteric hip fractures who could walk independently before the injury and were followed up for >= 3 months after surgery. Initially, 124 patients were identified, but 33 of these were excluded because other implants were used for internal fixation. Of the remaining 91 patients in whom PFNs were used at the time of internal fixation who were included for the perioperative evaluation, 66 patients followed up for >= 3 months were included in the clinical evaluations. Results: The average surgical time was 56.8 +/- 19.6 minutes (range, 23-123 minutes). The average blood loss was 89 +/- 41 mL (range, 0-245 mL). The union rate was 98%. Discussion: There were no cases of nail jamming, and all nails were successfully inserted below the end of the distal isthmus without additional reaming to dilate the canal. Conclusions: Proximal femoral nails were a useful implant in Japanese elderly patients with trochanteric hip fractures and gave comparable clinical outcomes despite the femoral length being short and occurrence of intensive bowing.

Patients and Methods: From 2009 through 2014, 933 patients with mandibular fracture were enrolled in the study. Fifteen variables were statistically analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods to investigate risk factors for MDRB infection after RIF of mandibular fracture. Results: Sixteen of 933 patients (1.71%) developed MDRB infection. Of these, 6 were infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 6 with multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA), 1 with extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumonia, 1 with extended spectrum b-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, 1 with multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and 1 with multidrug-resistant Enterobacter cloacae. Univariate analysis showed that risk factors of MDRB infection after RIF of mandibular fracture were age, obesity (body mass index >= 25 kg/m(2) for Asians), polytrauma (Injury Severity Score >16), preoperative infection, open fractures, comminuted fractures accompanied by other facial fractures, and teeth involving the fracture line. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that obesity, preoperative infection, and open fractures were independent risk factors of MDRB infection. After systemic anti-infection treatments with vancomycin, piperacillin, tazobactam, local drainage, and debridement, the infections were under control. Fourteen patients achieved clinical healing at an average time of 8.71 months, and 2 did not achieve clinical healing. The overall mean follow-up was 18.81 months. Conclusion: MDRB infections occurring after RIF of mandibular fracture were caused mainly by MRSA and MDR-PA. Obesity, preoperative infection, and open fractures were the main risk factors. To lower risk, surgical debridement should be performed sooner once acute infection has been controlled, stable fixation should be achieved with the smallest amount of internal fixation material, the blood supply should be protected, and a reconstruction plate should be used to fix sites with greater stress or large comminuted fracture.

However, it suffers from distinct disadvantages such as large incision, implant irritation, and need for subsequent implant removal. Here, we propose a novel technique using closed reduction and percutaneous fixation with three cannulated screws (TCS), which may be an alternative to this established conventional technique. Although some researchers have proposed alternative methods including closed reduction and cannulated screw fixation, with or without additional wires through the screws, and arthroscopic-assisted reduction and fixation, there are few studies that focus on the biomechanical stability of percutaneous fixation using only cannulated screws. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate TCS versus TBW for simple transverse patellar fractures in cadaveric and patients' level, aiming to determine whether TCS show superiority over TBW in terms of biomechanical stability in a cadaveric study with benign clinical feasibility and outcomes in patients.MethodsWe conducted a cadaveric study with 15 knee specimens that had simple transverse patellar fractures. We used two fixation techniques: TBW (group A, n = 6) and TCS (group B, n = 9). We applied sinusoidal forces (25 N-125 N) at 1/5 Hz and 90 degrees knee flexion to simulate knee movement. We compared the displacements at the fracture site between the two groups. We also used the same technique in a total of 23 patients and followed up them for at least 1 year.ResultsTCS demonstrated favourable biomechanical stability in the cadaveric study. The technique also performed excellently in terms of postoperative pain, knee function recovery, and complication rates during the follow-up period.ConclusionsThe technique provides a surgical treatment option with small incisions, minimal soft tissue irritation, and possibly lower removal rate of bothersome material.

The force which produced a 3 mm gap (3 mm gap strength). as detected visually with the aid of operating loupes. and the maximum load prior to failure of the fixation (maximum force) were measured from all tests Results: The mean value for the 3 mm gap strength was 1356 29 +/- 226 97 N for group 1 and 882 63 30521 N for group 2. The mean value of the maximum load strength was 1487.13 +/- 298 N for group 1 and 1232 10762 N for group 2 There were significant differences in 3 mm gap strengths of the two groups (p=0 005) There was also a significant difference in the maximum load between the two groups (p=0 016).

Twenty-six patients were treated at the University of California, San Diego Medical Center or the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in San Diego, CA. All cases were performed under the direction of a single neurosurgeon (WRT). METHODS: A retrospective review of patients' charts and imaging was performed to determine outcomes after anterior cervical spine operations. Specifically, we looked at the need for additional surgery, local reaction to the bioabsorbable polymer, fusion rate, and complications. Procedures involved the C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and/or C6-C7 levels, and fibular allograft was used in all but one case. The anterior cervical discectomy and fusion procedures with internal fixation were performed in 26 patients between March 2000 and November 2001. The patients were followed for up to 2 years after surgery (average, 14 mo). RESULTS: Radiographic fusion was achieved in 25 (96.2%) of 26 patients. Only one instance of treatment failure was encountered that required additional surgery and the placement of a titanium plate. There were no clinical signs or symptoms of reaction to the bioabsorbable material. CONCLUSION: The rates of fusion after single-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with internal fixation using bioabsorbable polymer and screws in this study match those using metallic implants, as previously reported in the literature, and are superior to those achieved with noninstrumented fusions. Preliminary results suggest that this newly available technology for anterior fusion is as effective in single-level disease as traditional titanium plating systems. The bioabsorbable material seems to be tolerated well by patients. A larger, randomized, controlled study is necessary to bring the results to statistical significance.

Material/Methods: This retrospective study included 64 patients with extra-articular and simple intra-articular fractures of the distal radius who underwent intramedullary fixation using volar locking plate (n=35, mean age 47.3 +/- 16.4 years, 82.9% female) or intramedullary nailing (n=29, mean age 51.3 +/- 10.1 years, 58.6% female). Outcome measures were range of motion (ROM); visual analog scale (VAS); Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score; Gartland-Werley score; Stewart score; and radiographic findings. Results: Time to fracture union was 5.5 +/- 1.2 and 5.2 +/- 0.6 weeks after volar plate fixation and intramedullary nailing, respectively (p>0.05). Compared to volar plate fixation, intramedullary nailing provided better restoration of volar tilt (6.9 +/- 6.3 degrees vs. 9.4 +/- 1.6 degrees, p=0.004) and wrist flexion (74.3 +/- 15.1 degrees vs. 67.9 +/- 13.1 degrees, p=0.003). However, volar plate fixation was significantly better in restoration of supination (85.0 +/- 8.3 degrees vs. 81.9 +/- 5.1 degrees, p=0.001) and radio-ulnar variance (0.7 +/- 0.8 mm vs. 1.1 +/- 0.9 mm, p=0.05), DASH score (9.2 +/- 9.0 vs. 15.0 +/- 3.3, p=0.035), and Gartland-Werley score (1.8 +/- 0.9 vs. 4.9 +/- 5.4, p=0.004). Volar plate and intramedullary nailing groups were comparable with respect to Stewart score (1.5 +/- 0.7 and 1.6 +/- 1.3, p>0.05) and complication rates (34.3% vs. 37.9%, p>0.05). Conclusions: Both volar plate fixation and intramedullary nail fixation provide good clinical and radiographic outcomes for primarily extra-articular or simple intra-articular distal radius fractures. As intramedullary nailing provides better restoration of volar tilt and wrist flexion, volar plate fixation provides better restoration of radio-ulnar variance and wrist supination.

The effect of vessel material properties and pulsatile wall motion on the fixation of a proximal stent of an endovascular graft	MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS			English	Article						Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA); Stent-graft migration; Artery analogue; Proximal stent attachment force	ABDOMINAL AORTIC-ANEURYSMS; IN-VIVO; ILIAC FIXATION; MIGRATION; REPAIR; MODEL; DISPLACEMENT; RESISTANCE; AAA	Migration is a serious failure mechanism associated with endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (EVAR). The effect of vessel material properties and pulsatile wall motion on stent fixation has not been previously investigated. A proximal stent from a commercially available stent graft was implanted into the proximal neck of silicone rubber abdominal aortic aneurysm models of varying proximal neck stiffness (beta = 25.39 and 20.44). The stent was then dislodged by placing distal force on the stent struts. The peak force to completely dislodge the stent was measured using a loadcell. Dislodgment was performed at ambient pressure with no flow (NF) and during pulsatile flow (PF) at pressures of 120/80 mmHg and 140/100 mmHg to determine if pulsatile wall motions affected the dislodgement force. An imaging analysis was performed at ambient pressure and at pressures of 120 mmHg and 140 mmHg to investigate diameter changes on the model due to the radial force of the stent and internal pressurisation. Stent displacement forces were similar to 50% higher in the stiffer model (7.16-8.4 N) than in the more compliant model (3.67-4.21 N). The mean displacement force was significantly reduced by 10.95-12.83% from the case of NF to the case of PF at 120/80 mmHg. A further increase in pressure to 140/120 mmHg had no significant effect on the displacement force. The imaging analysis showed that the diameter in the region of the stent was 0.37 mm greater in the less stiff model at all the pressures which could reduce the fixation of the stent. The results suggest that the fixation of passively fixated aortic stents could be comprised in more compliant walls and that pulsatile motions of the wall can reduce the maximum stent fixation.

Polyaxial locking plate fixation in distal femur fractures: A biomechanical comparison	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC TRAUMA			English	Article						biomechanics; locking plate; polyaxial; femur	INVASIVE STABILIZATION SYSTEM; ANGLED BLADE PLATE; INTERNAL-FIXATION; FEMORAL FIXATION; SCREW	Objectives: Uniaxial, first-generation locking plates have become increasingly popular for fixation of supracondylar femur fractures. Polyaxial plates are currently available, which allow for variable-angle screw insertion; however, the biomechanical integrity of these new locking constructs is yet unproven. This study compares the mechanical stability of a conventional locking plate with that of a new polyaxial design. Methods: A comminuted supracondylar femur fracture (AO/OTA33-A3) gap model was created in fourth-generation synthetic composite bones. Fixation was obtained with 2 different plate constructs: (1) a conventional locking plate (uniaxial screw heads threading directly into plate) and (2) a polyaxial locking plate (screw heads are captured and "locked" into a fixed angle using locking caps). Fight specimens of each type were then tested in axial, torsional, and cyclic axial modes on a material testing machine. Results: The mean axial stiffness for the polyaxial locking plate was 24.4% greater than the conventional locking plate (168.2 vs 127.1 N/mm; P < 0.0001). The mean torsional stiffness was also greater for the polyaxial plate (2.78 vs 2.57 Nm/degree; P = 0.0226). Cyclic axial loading caused significantly less (P = 0.0034) mean irreversible deformation in the polyaxial plate (5.6 mm) than in the conventional plate (8.8 mm). The mean ultimate load to failure was significantly higher (P = 0.0005) for the polyaxial plate (1560 N) than for the conventional plate (1337 N). Conclusions: The tested plate construct with its polyaxial locking screw mechanism provides a biomechanically sound fixation option for supracondylar femur fractures. The frictional locking mechanism allows maintenance of angular stability while affording the option of variable screw placement.

Design: Biomechanical, human cadaver. Setting: Level 1 trauma center. Intervention: Hemipelvis and SI motion were analyzed on a Materials Testing System before and after creation of a vertically unstable APC III pelvic injury. Posterior fixation constructs consisted of iliosacral screws: (1) one into S1, (2) two into S1, or (3) one into S1 and one into S2. Results were obtained for all posterior constructs with and without a two-hole symphyseal plate. Main Outcome Measurement: Hemipelvis and SI motion with axial loading. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between one or two iliosacral screws when hemipelvis rotational or linear displacement was examined at the SI joint. The two-hole symphyseal plate significantly increased the stability of the fixation construct in resisting linear displacement in all three planes. Without the symphyseal plate, an abnormal loading response was seen at the SI joint, resulting in paradoxical posterior translation and sagittal plane rotation. The addition of the plate restored the normal response, and anterior rotation and translation were observed as in the intact state. Conclusions: Anterior symphyseal plating for the vertically unstable hemipelvis significantly increases the stability of the fixation construct and restores the normal response of the hemipelvis to axial loading. A significant benefit to supplementary iliosacral screws in addition to a properly placed S1 iliosacral screw was not shown.

Materials and methods Consecutive patients who were treated by CT-guided fixation of sacral or acetabular fractures after high-energy trauma were included. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia, with dual CT and fluoroscopic guidance, by interventional radiologists. Fractures were minimally displaced or reduced unstable posterior pelvic ring disruptions, with or without sacroiliac disjunction (Tile B or C) and minimally displaced acetabular fractures. The primary outcome evaluated was screw accuracy. Secondary outcomes included patient radiation exposure, duration of the procedure, complications, clinical functional score (Majeed score), and pain scale (VAS, visual analog scale) evaluation during a follow-up period from 4 to 30 months postoperatively. Results Thirty-two patients were included (mean age 46) and 62 screws were inserted. Screw placement was correct in 90.3% of patients (95% of screws). Mean procedure duration was 67 min and mean patient radiation exposure was 965 mGy cm. Mean follow-up was 13 months and no complications were observed. The mean Majeed score at final follow-up was 84/100 and the mean VAS was 1.6/10. Conclusion This technique is an effective and safe procedure in specific cases of pelvic ring and acetabulum fractures. It allows accurate screw placement in a minimally invasive manner, leading to effective management of poly-traumatized patients.

Materials and Methods: A 3-dimensional computerized model of a human mandible with posterior teeth was generated. The bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy was virtually performed on this model. The separated model was assembled with 9 fixation methods: single screw, 2 screws one behind the other, 2 screws one below the other, 3 screws in an L configuration, 3 screws in an inverted backward L configuration, miniplate with 2 screws, miniplate with 4 screws, 2 parallel plates (upper + lower border), and square miniplate with 4 screws. Then, 75-, 135-, and 600-N vertical loads were applied on the posterior teeth of these models. The stress distribution on the screw sites on the buccal cortex was measured by the finite element method. Results: In this model all the fixation methods withstood forces between 75 and 135 N. However, the single-screw and the 2-hole miniplate models showed that the stress distributions in the configurations were intolerable when 600 N of posterior force was applied. The results of this study indicated that the inverted backward L configuration with 3 bicortical screws was the most stable. Conclusion: Although this study indicated that the inverted backward L configuration with 3 bicortical screws was the most stable pattern, most of the patterns had adequate stability for clinical applications (mean, 125 N).

Materials and Methods: Thirteen 90-day-old white New Zealand rabbits weighing 2 to 2.6 kg were included in this Study. Unilateral mandibular fractures were created in all of the animals and fixed with microplates and screws. Microplates that had been adapted for fixation of the left (experimental) side were also used as a template for the drilling procedure on the right (control) side of the mandible. The plate was then removed, and screws were inserted. Digital submentovertex radiographs of each animal were taken before the operation and 6 months after surgery. Cephalometric values were analyzed. The distance between the centers of the 2 screws on the right side of the mandible was measured with a caliper in all samples, and values were compared with measurements taken from the left (experimental) side of the mandible upon which the plates had been placed. Results: The mean amount of mandibular growth was 4.38 +/- 2.43 mm on the right (control) side and 4.64 +/- 2.27 mm on the left (experimental) side. This difference was not statistically significant (P > .05). The distance between the 2 screws was 13.89 +/- 0.23 nuti on the experimental side and 13.44 +/- 0.46 nun on the control side. This difference was statistically significant (P < .05).

Unstable patterns have longer times to union and higher nonunion rates. Stable restoration of the distal clavicle is important in decreasing the nonunion rate in distal clavicle fractures. The purpose of this study was to biomechanically compare operative constructs for the treatment of unstable, comminuted distal-third clavicle fractures in a cadaveric model using a locking plate and coracoclavicular reconstruction. We hypothesized that the combination of coracoclavicular reconstruction and a distal clavicle locking plate is biomechanically superior to either construct used individually. Materials and methods: An unstable distal clavicle fracture was created in 21 thawed fresh-frozen cadaveric specimens. The 21 specimens were divided into 3 treatment groups of 7: distal-third locking plate, acromioclavicular (AC) TightRope (Arthrex, Naples, FL, USA), and distal-third locking plate and AC TightRope together. After fixation, each specimen was cyclically tested with recording of displacement to determine the stiffness and stability of each construct, followed by load-to-failure testing in tension and compression to determine the maximum load. Results: The combined construct of the locking distal clavicle plate and coracoclavicular reconstruction resulted in increased stiffness, maximum resistance to compression, and decreased displacement compared with either construct alone. Conclusion: Greater fracture stability was achieved with the combination of the AC TightRope and locking clavicle plate construct than with either alone, suggesting a possibility for increased fracture-healing rates.

In the current study, canine tumor FFPE blocks were used to 1) compare common commercial DNA and RNA extraction kits; 2) compare target gene expression measured in FFPE blocks and biopsies stored in a commercial storage reagent; 3) assess the impact of fixation time; and 4) perform biomolecular investigations on archival samples chosen according to formalin fixation times. Nucleic acids yield and quality were determined by spectrophotometer and capillary electrophoresis, respectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays for the following genes: BCL-2-associated X protein, B-cell lymphoma extra large, antigen identified by monoclonal antibody Ki-67, proto-oncogene c-KIT (c-kit). Two internal control genes (Golgin A1 and canine transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing 4), together with direct sequencing of c-kit exons 8, 9, 11, and 17, were used as end points. Differences in DNA/RNA yield and purity were noticed among the commercial kits. Nucleic acids (particularly RNA) extracted from paraffin blocks were degraded, even at lower fixation times. Compared to samples held in the commercial storage reagent, archived tissues showed a poorer amplification. Therefore, a gold standard protocol for DNA/RNA isolation from canine tumor FFPE blocks for molecular investigations is still troublesome. More standardized storage conditions, including time between sample acquisition and fixation, fixation time, and sample thickness, are needed to guarantee the preservation of nucleic acids and, then, their possible use in retrospective transcriptomic analysis.

The screw performance and mechanical functions are directly associated to the quality of the screws fixation in the vertebrae. Photoelasticity is an important tool to perform comparative studies of this nature. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare, by using photoelasticity, internal stresses produced by the screw with an external diameter of 6 mm, when submitted to two different pullout strengths. Materials and Methods: For this, four photoelastic models were produced. The simulation was conducted by using two pullout strengths: 0.75 and 1.50 kgf. The maximum shear stresses were calculated on 19 points around the screws, using the Tardy compensation method. Results:The values of maximum shear stress were higher with the load of 1.50 kgf. Conclusion: Thus, the screw will be more susceptible to pullout when heavier loads are applied. According to our analysis, we also found that the site with the highest maximum shear stress was found to be at the peak of creast, particularly near the tips of the screws, regardless of the load employed.

Eutrophication leads to increased sedimentation of organic material, increasing the Extent of anoxic bottoms and subsequently increasing the internal phosphorus loading. In addition, the hypoxic water volume displays a negative relationship with the total dissolved inorganic nitrogen pool, suggesting greater overall nitrogen removal with increased hypoxia. Enhanced internal loading of phosphorus and the removal of dissolved inorganic nitrogen leads to lower nitrogen to phosphorus ratios, which are one of the main factors promoting nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria blooms. Because cyanobacteria blooms in the open waters of the Baltic Sea seem to be strongly regulated by internal processes, the effects of external nutrient reductions are scale-dependent. During longer time scales, reductions in external phosphorus load may reduce cyanobacteria blooms; however, on shorter time scales the internal phosphorus loading can counteract external phosphorus reductions. The coupled processes inducing internal loading, nitrogen removal, and the prevalence of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria can qualitatively be described as a potentially self-sustaining "vicious circle." To effectively reduce cyanobacteria blooms and overall signs of eutrophication, reductions in both nitrogen and phosphorus external loads appear essential.

This device uses the so called quick casting method, which can be quickly concreted, to efficiently reduce the injury to patients. It is mainly composed of the macromolecule casting material and the steel stainless nails which fasten the device to the bone. In order to verify the feasibility of the designed structure, FEM (finite element method) was used to simulate the real condition of the load when the device was used after an operation. At the same time, optimum design was also carried out for the number and dimension of the nails in order to obtain the best operation effect. It was concluded from the simulated result that when the real load was applied on the fastened broken bone, the relative displacement of the broken border was just 0.33 mm, which was much lesser than the permitted limit (1 mm). This was in line with the request to cure the patients whose bones are broken and it showed the correctness of the design. Finally, in order to prove the feasibility of the design, ten sheep were used as specimen. It was concluded from X-ray sketches of 2, 4 and 8 weeks that there is no relative displacement between the borders of the broken bone and the bone that was well healed. This indicated that this scheme can be feasibly used to cure the broken bones. However, this design scheme can be used as an effective treatment means.

However, variable construct stiffness reported in the literature may be attributable to differing test configurations and direct comparisons may clarify these differences. We therefore asked whether different distal femur locking plate systems and constructs will lead to different (1) axial and rotational stiffness and (2) fatigue under cyclic loading. We investigated four plate systems for distal femur fixation (AxSOS, LCP, PERI-LOC, POLYAX) of differing designs and materials using bone substitutes in a distal femur fracture model (OTA/AO 33-A3). We created six constructs of each of the four plating systems. Stiffness under static and cyclic loading and fatigue under cyclic loading were measured. Mean construct stiffness under axial loading was highest for AxSOS (100.8 N/mm) followed by PERI-LOC (80.8 N/mm) and LCP (62.6 N/mm). POLYAX construct stiffness testing showed the lowest stiffness (51.7 N/mm) with 50% stiffness of AxSOS construct testing. Mean construct stiffness under torsional loading was similar in the group of AxSOS and PERI-LOC (3.40 Nm/degree versus 3.15 Nm/degree) and in the group of LCP and POLYAX (2.63 Nm/degree versus 2.56 Nm/degree). The fourth load level of > 75,000 cycles was reached by three of six AxSOS, three of six POLYAX, and two of six PERI-LOC constructs. All others including all LCP constructs failed earlier. Implant design and material of new-generation distal femur locking plate systems leads to a wide range of differences in construct stiffness. Assuming construct stiffness affects fracture healing, these data may influence surgical decision-making in choosing an implant system.

They are currently not in widespread use because of the low strength of the materials and the requisite large volume of the resulting bone plate. The aim of the Current study was to discover a minimally invasive bioabsorbable bone plate design that can provide the same mechanical stability as a standard titanium bone plate. A finite element model of a mandible with a fracture in the body region is subjected to bite loads that are common to patients postsurgery. The model is used first to determine benchmark stress and strain Values for a titanium plate. These values are then set as the limits within which the bioabsorbable bone plate must comply. The model is then modified to consider a bone plate made of the polymer poly-L/DL-lactide 70/30. An optimization routine is run to determine file smallest volume of bioabsorbable bone plate that can perform and a titanium bone plate when fixating fractures of this considered type. Two design parameters are varied for the bone plate design during the optimization analysis. The analysis determined that a strut style poly-L-lactide-CO-DL-lactide plate of 690 film 2 can provide as much mechanical stability as a similar titanium design structure of 172 mm(2). The model has determined a bioabsorbable bone plate design that is as strong as a titanium plate when fixating fractures of file load-bearing mandible. This is an intriguing outcome, considering that the polymer material has only 6% of the stiffness of titanium.

Steroid receptors are fragile and optimal handling of both cytological and histological material, including fixation, is crucial. Liquid based material offers the possibility to prepare a number of slides from one lesion and is increasingly being used for immunocytochemistry. It also offers the possibility to prepare several smears and to store these at different temperatures as well as storing residual material in the liquid. Materials and Methods: The samples consisted of fine needle aspirate material from 53 breast carcinomas. Direct smears and liquid based preparations were used in parallel for immunocytochemical detection of ER and PgR receptor status. Slides from liquid suspensions were stored at -20 degrees C and -74 degrees C for 3 and 6 months, respectively. Direct smears were fixed primarily in 4% formalin. Liquid based specimens were post-fixed in 4% formalin. All specimens were subjected to microwave-stimulated epitope retrieval. Antibody concentrations were ER 1: 150 and PgR 1: 200 for both preparation methods. The immunostaining program was identical for both the methods. Results: Liquid based specimens had a statistically non-significant higher percentage of positive cases compared to direct smears. Specimens prepared from liquid suspensions and stored at -20 degrees C and -74 degrees C for 3 and 6 months, respectively, showed a virtually unchanged ER and PgR reactivity (P = 0.002). Conclusions: Liquid suspensions and liquid based slide preparations seem to offer an optimal pre-fixation and preservation of ER/PgR in breast carcinoma cells. Post-fixation with 4% formalin followed by microwave-stimulated epitope retrieval before immunostaining is recommended.

Different from other types of patellar fractures, inferior pole fractures are usually comminuted, and other traditional fixation methods, such as tension band wiring, may not meet the fixation needs. We propose fixing inferior pole fractures of the patella with a custom-made anchor-like plate combined with cerclage and report the surgical outcomes. Material and methods This is a retrospective clinical study. From June 2018 to August 2020, 21 patients with inferior patella fracture treated at Hong Hui Hospital Affiliated to Xi'an Jiaotong University received a custom-made anchor-like plate combined with cerclage. Complications of the surgical fixation methods and final knee function were used as the main outcome measures. Results All fractures achieved good union, and the union time ranged from 8 to 12 weeks. No patients had serious complications, such as internal fixation failure or infection. The average duration of surgery of patients was 75.05 7.26 min, and the intraoperative blood loss was 60.099.49 ml. At the last follow-up, the range of motion of the knee was 120 degrees-140 degrees, with an average of 131.436.92 degrees, the Bostman score was 27-30, and the Lysholm score ranged from 82 to 95. All patients showed good knee function one year after the operation. Conclusion We used a modified T-shaped plate combined with cerclage technology to fix inferior fractures pole of the patella, providing reliable fixation, allowing early functional exercise of the knee joint, and providing patients with good knee joint function after surgery.

Materials and methods: A 1-year prospective study was conducted; 41 consecutive patients presenting with mandibular fractures were included. A resorbable system was used in 21 patients, while in 20 patients a titanium fixation device was used. Functional outcome was evaluated objectively at several time points (2, 4 and 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and 1 year after surgery). Bite forces over molars and incisors, mouth opening distance, occlusal status, operation time, fee for implants, bone healing and plate-associated complications were evaluated. Functional and overall satisfaction was measured by patients themselves subjectively. Results: A statistical difference was found only in maximal mouth opening and molar bite force, both greater for the titanium group in the 2-week time point, achieving comparable measurements in subsequent ones. This coincides with the patient-reported statistically lower satisfaction rates. The cost of the resorbable device was nearly 3 times more expensive than the titanium devices. Conclusion: Resorbable fixation can achieve stability of bone healing at 1 year postoperatively, with functional and satisfaction outcomes comparable to those associated with titanium hardware from the fourth week postoperatively, while yielding unique advantages.

Flexible fibrous composite materials are promising materials that offer excellent biomechanical compatibility. Flexible composite fixation devices provide enough initial fracture stabilization and an adequate environment to promote the desired secondary healing process. Fractures fixed with reamed and unreamed intramedullary (IM) nails exhibit advantages and disadvantages. In this study, the effect of reamed and unreamed IM nails made of stainless steel and various composites (WSN3 k [0](2nT,) WSN3 k [+/- 30](nT), and Twintex [O](2nT)) on the bone healing process was studied. A finite element model and mechano-regulation algorithm with deviatoric strain and fluid flow were programmed to estimate the healing process. A suitable biophysical environment was predicted for successful bone healing. The Twintex [0](2nT) IM nail contained 19.57% and 33.44% lower stress than that of the stainless steel at day 1, reducing the stress shielding effect. The body weight carried by the bone was 72.8% higher in the Twintex [0](2nT) nail with a maximum relief of 79.8% in stresses relative to the stainless steel IM nail at final day of healing confirming the maximum healing.

Methods: An osteotomy was created in 24 fresh cadaveric mandibles at the angle and fixated by the Champy technique with similar resorbable craniofacial plating systems from 4 manufacturers. Each mandible was held rigid as a material test system applied a downward force anteriorly. The critical tolerance was measured and the type of failure was noted. Results: Critical failure occurred at forces from 34.6 to 137.8 N. We found a statistically significant difference between the plating groups ( P <. 001 for all comparisons). The point of failure was almost uniformly at the plate. Conclusions: Critical failure was overwhelmingly due to rupture of the plate rather than to stripping or shearing of the screws as had been strongly expected. We found differences in plate strengths for this particular application and did not evaluate their respective long-term resorptive properties. We do not advocate that single resorbable plate fixation be the sole means of mandible angle fracture fixation, regardless of the plating system used.

As the femoral footprint of the ligament is quite large, an ideal graft fixation position on the medial notch wall has not yet been identified. The aim of this study was to compare three different graft fixation positions within the anatomical footprint of the PCL and test it for posterior tibial translation at different knee flexion angles. Methods: In six human knee specimens a drawer test was simulated on a material testing machine by applying load on the tibia. At three different knee flexion angles (0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees) knee mobility was examined with respect to tibial posterior translation and stiffness for the following conditions: intact ligaments, detached PCL, three different graft fixation positions on the femoral condyle. Results: Replacement of the PCL within its femoral footprint restored knee stability in terms of tibial posterior translation. Low graft position showed comparable drawer displacements to the intact condition for all knee flexion angles (p > 0.344). A higher graft position excessively reduced the posterior translation (p < 0.047) and resulted in a restricted knee mobility and a stiffer joint. Conclusions: Graft fixation positions on the femoral condyle play a crucial role in postoperative knee mobility and joint functionality after PCL replacement. Even though all graft fixation positions were placed within the femoral footprint of a native PCL, only the lower position on the medial notch wall showed comparable posterior tibial translation to an intact PCL.

Materials and methods: 40 synthetic hemi-mandibular polyurethane replicates were used. Two groups of fixing materials were included: 20 mandibles fixed with 40 straight plates with four roles each (2.0 mm system) and 20 mandibles fixed with 20 Y-shaped plates (2.0 mm system and 1.5 mm thickness). The samples were submitted to linear loading in the following directions: 10 mandibles from each group from lateral to medial and 10 mandibles from each group from anterior to posterior. A universal loading machine, Instron Universal 4411, was used to performed the tests, and the resistance of each fixed mandible was assessed at displacements of 1 mm, 3 mm, and 5 mm. The t-test for independent samples was performed. The p value was set at <0.05. Results: The worst mechanical resistance was found in the Y-plates loaded from anterior to posterior. The best mechanical resistance was in two straight hole plates loaded from lateral to medial. The Y-plates and two straight hole plates showed similar resistance when a lateral to medial load was applied. Conclusion: There was no difference between the plates when lateral to medial loading was tested. (c) 2017 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Late results of absorbable pin fixation in the treatment of radial head fractures	CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH			English	Article							BIODEGRADABLE POLYLACTIDE IMPLANTS; MASON TYPE-III; INTERNAL-FIXATION; TISSUE-REACTIONS; IN-VIVO; POLYGLYCOLIDE PINS; ARTHROPLASTY; MANAGEMENT; DEVICES; HAND	The use of bioabsorbable pins with prolonged degradation periods for fracture fixation has raised concerns about adverse soft tissue reactions, including seromas, discharging sinuses, or osteolytic changes. We asked whether bioabsorbable pins of self-reinforced polylactic acid polymer used in radial head fractures resulted in such reactions. We retrospectively reviewed 21 patients followed a minimum of 36 months (mean, 81 months; range, 36-136 months). There were nine Mason II, 10 Mason III, and two Mason IV fractures, which were evaluated clinically and radiographically. All fractures healed well with no radiographic signs of osteolysis. The mean Mayo Elbow Performance score was 93.8 (range, 20-100), which is comparable to the outcome of historical groups with radial head arthroplasty. The mean range of flexion of the elbow was 9 degrees to 132 degrees, with 79 degrees pronation and 77 degrees supination. The grip strength of the operated arm was not affected in comparison to the contralateral arm (mean range, 38.6 versus 40.9 kg). No material-related adverse effects were observed during and beyond the degradation period. Our data suggest concerns about soft tissue or bony reactions from these materials in radial head fractures are not justified. Level of Evidence: Level IV, therapeutic study. See the Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

Material and methods: 22 patients with Neer type 2 distal clavicle fracture were enrolled in that prospective study. All patients underwent indirect reduction and osteosynthesis performed by coracoclavicular fixation with minimal invasive double button lift-up system. Postoperative follow-up was carried out clinically and radiologically with plain X-rays and utilization of Constant and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment (ASES) shoulder scores. Mean follow-up time was 15 months. A standard sling was applied for 2 weeks, postoperatively. Rehabilitation program was started on postoperative day 1. Results: Mean age was 39 (range: 21-60), 18 of the patients were male. Right dominant extremity was affected in 14 patients. Mean duration of the surgical intervention was 40 min (range: 30-55 min). Mean union time was found to be 14 weeks (range: 7-21 weeks). Mean postoperative ASES and Constant scores were 79.9 (66.9-88.3) and 82.2 (71-100), respectively. The duration of return to normal daily activities were found to be 4.5 months. Any loss of reduction, AC joint arthrosis, and clavicular shortening were not detected in X-rays. Conclusion: This study has demonstrated that indirect osteosynthesis performed by coracoclavicular fixation with double button lift-up system in the treatment of unstable Neer type IIa fractures of the distal clavicle had successful clinical, radiological, and functional outcomes.

Due to the unique layered and band structure of bismuth oxyhalide (BiOX), it is an emergent class of photocatalysts which display adequate properties that promote the robust light response and may result in amplification of solar energy conversion. The current review will summarize the recent revolution in BiOX-based energy applications such as H-2 and O-2 evolution, as well as N-2 fixation, and will present structural engineering and design solutions for improving energy conversion. Particularly, the preparation and structure tailoring of BiOX materials, as well as some other advanced techniques such as the building of Moire superlattices, heter-ojunctions, and tailoring the internal electric field, may boost the photocatalysis of BiOX materials. Additionally, various composite frameworks are discussed, emphasizing the importance of BiOX-based nanocomposites. Finally, the primary problems and potential for the material based on BiOX are discussed in terms of their future development. This review will provide a link between structural engineering and environmental applications and will provide a preferred path toward the novel material design based on BiOX for environmental and in particular, energy-related applications.

In some cases, the mandible can be weakened by the presence of an unerupted or impacted tooth. The fate of this tooth in the fracture line and its effects on bone healing remain an important outcome event. Materials and Methods: In this study, we analyzed the records of 117 patients with a total of 121 fractures having an unerupted tooth remaining in the fracture line who were treated and followed by the Dental Faculty of Ankara University between 1986 and 1996. All were open fractures, and none of the patients had a history of an acute inflammatory episode related to the unerupted tooth before the injury. Intermaxillary fixation was used in all cases. Results: Three of the patients subsequently required open reduction with internal fixation. The unerupted tooth was not extracted in any patient. The fixation was maintained for an average of 45 days and followed up for 3 months. No complications were encountered. Conclusion: According to these results, we suggest that asymptomatic impacted teeth in the fracture line of uncomplicated mandible fractures do not cause delayed healing when treated with closed reduction.

Suture anchor loading after rotator cuff repair: Effects of an additional lateral row	JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY			English	Article							SINGLE-ROW; FIXATION; STRENGTH	Hypothesis: Our initial hypothesis was that the medial row of double-row rotator cuff repair techniques would bear most of the load on the repaired cuff. Materials and methods: Six cadaver shoulders underwent simulated rotator cuff repairs using sequential single row, double-row, and suture-bridge repair techniques. Suture tensions at each anchor were measured for several static, simulated shoulder positions by specially designed, instrumented anchors. Results: Significantly greater suture tensions were measured in the anchors in a Single row repair construct than either the double row repair or suture bridge repair construct (P<.001). In the double-row and suture bridge techniques, there was no apparent difference in the loads born by the medial and lateral row anchors. Shoulder abduction from 45 to 60 had little effect on anchor tensions; 45 internal and external rotation significantly (P=.032) increased loads on the anterior and posterior anchors by at least 125%. Discussion: Forces are transmitted through the entire portion of the tendon at its humeral fixation, loading the lateral anchors as well as the medial row for the techniques studied. This "load sharing" can explain the higher fixation strengths of double row techniques seen experimentally. Conclusion: The magnitude and distribution of anchor suture tensions could have important implications for lateral row fixation devices and post-operative positioning and activity.

Materials and methods: From 2008 to 2018, eleven patients with atlantoaxial dislocation (AAD) and BI underwent surgical reduction using C1/C2 the joint reduction technique with a fibular graft/peek cage placement followed by C1 lateral mass/C2 pedicle screw fixation. In two cases that we originally planned to perform C1/C2 joint reduction, occiput-C2 pedicle screw fixation was performed instead due to intraoperative challenges. Post-operative course and surgical complications will be discussed. Results: A total of 13 patients, with an average age of 30.46 +/- 13.23 years (range 12-57), were operated. In one patient, iatrogenic vertebral artery injury occurred without any neurological complication. JOA score improved from 10.45 +/- 1.128 to 15.0 +/- 1.949 (p < 0.0001, paired t-test). All radiological indices were improved (p at least < 0.001). No construct failure was seen in any of the patients with C1-2 facet joint distraction technique during follow-up, and no additional anterior decompression surgery was required. Conclusions: C1/C2 joint reduction technique with fibular graft/cervical PEEK cage of BI patients together with AAD seems to be an effective and safe surgical method of treatment.

Implementation of resorbable plates prevents issues resulting from left plates. The aim of this study is to compare the usage of bioresorbable and titanium A shape condyle plate in condylar fractures. (2) Methods: Thickness of 1.0 mm, height of 31 mm, and width of 19 mm polylactic acid (PLLA) and titanium A shape plate with 2.0 mm-wide connecting bar and 9 holes were tested with finite element analysis in high right condylar neck fracture. (3) Results: On bone surface the highest stress is on the anterior bridge around first hole (approx. 100 MPa). The highest stress on screws is located in the first screw around plate in the anterior bridge and is greater in titanium (150 MPa) than PLLA (114 MPa). (4) Conclusion: Pressure on bone in PLLA osteosynthesis is two times higher than in titanium fixation. On small areas where pressure on bone is too high it causes local bone degradation around the fracture and may delay the healing process or make it impossible. Fixation by PLLA is such flexible that bone edges slide and twist what may lead to degradation of callus.

Materials and Methods: High and low subcondylar fractures were simulated on a nonhomogenous mandibular model, and rhombic, trapezoid, and lambda plates and 2 miniplates were used for fixation. The stress in the bone and displacement of the fracture site were measured using finite element analysis. Results: For both high and low subcondylar fractures, the lowest von Mises stress was measured in the rhombic plate system. For high subcondylar fractures, the highest tension in the cortical bone was measured in the trapezoid plate system, and the highest compression was measured in the rhombic plate system. For low subcondylar fractures, the highest tension in the bone was measured in the rhombic system and the highest compression was measured in the trapezoid system. In both high and low subcondylar fracture models, the least displacement amount was measured in the 2-plate system. Conclusions: The results of the present study have shown that the rhombic plate system might be the proper choice for high subcondylar fractures and the 2-plate system might provide better results for low subcondylar fractures.

Corrosion of metallic substances into tissues may lead to inflammatory responses such as systemic contact dermatitis (SCD), a skin condition where an individual who has previously been sensitized to a particular allergen via the cutaneous route will subsequently react to same allergen via the systemic route. This condition occurs following exposure to allergens such as metals, medications, and certain food substances. In recent years, the use of metal plates for internal fixation has become increasingly common in bone fracture repairs. Patient concerns: A 34-year-old Indonesian male presented with systemic erythema with itching 7 days following a bone plate fixation as a management for mandibular fracture. Diagnoses: Physical examination showed pruritic red macules, papules, and scales on almost his entire body, along with facial swelling. The patch test results revealed a positive reaction to nickel and cobalt. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with SCD. Interventions: The patient was treated with topical and systemic corticosteroids as well as bone plate removal. Outcome: After treatment, the eruption turned brown, the itching was resolved, and there were no facial swelling as well. Lessons: This case report highlights the need to consider the occurrence of SCD in patients following bone plate fixation.

Indeed, such devices are naturally degraded by the human body and a subsequent surgery for their removal is not needed. However, bioresorption has a remarkable side effect on the performance of the devices, since mechanical properties decay over time. This aspect is essential for bone healing. In the first 60 days, the pin must bear continuous mechanical stress while preventing torsional slip of bone fragments. Although torsional support can be improved with suitable pin section design, degradation kinetics and the consequent loss in mechanical stability are slowed down while using high molecular weight polymers, whose slow bioresorption increases recovery time and negatively affects patient care. Herein, a bioresorbable pin of new conception, in terms of cross-sectional shape and material formulation, is presented. Both section and polymer design are optimized through comprehensive mathematical modeling, which synergistically combines degradation and mechanical loads. As a result of the model, bioresorption time is minimized, whereas adequate mechanical resistance is ensured for the first 60 days. The most promising device is then injection molded, sterilized, mechanically tested, and successfully evaluated ex vivo in human femoral heads.

J	Durmus, YE; Ulus, A; Senel, A				Durmus, Yunus Emre; Ulus, Aykan; Senel, Alparslan			The Trans-Spinous Crosslink Increases the Pull-Out Strength of the Pedicle Screw Instrumentation	TURKISH NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Spine; Internal fixators; Pedicle screws; Crosslink; Pull-out strength	BIOMECHANICAL ANALYSIS; INTERNAL-FIXATION; LUMBAR SPINE; AUGMENTATION	AIM: To evaluate whether adding an extra anchoring point to the construct by passing the crosslink through a hole in the spinous process (trans-spinous crosslink technique), may prevent screw loosening by increasing the pull-out strength. MATERIAL and METHODS: Twenty-four fresh-frozen single lumbar sheep vertebrae were instrumented with pedicle screws bilaterally, and they are connected to each other with a crosslink. All vertebrae were assigned randomly to either the experiment (trans-spinous crosslink) group or the control group. In the experiment group, the crosslink was passed through a hole within the spinous process. In the control group, the posterior part of the hole was removed. The pull-out force of the construct was determined using a mechanical testing machine. RESULTS: The mean pull-out forces of the experiment group and the control group were 1949 +/- 361.55 N and 1338.57 +/- 220.26 N, respectively. The pull-out force of the experiment group was significantly higher than those of the control group with 99.9% confidence (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The pedicle screws rigidly anchor the internal fixation devices to the vertebral colon. In classical construct design, pedicle screws share the load. Adding extra anchoring points decreases screw share and may prevent construct pull-out. This study shows that the trans-spinous crosslink can serve as an anchoring point and increases the construct pull-out strength.

Methods: The constructs were tested with osteopenic cadaveric specimens in a two-part fracture model. Specimens were subjected to a battery of nondestructive torsion and axial compression tests, followed by a cyclic test. Construct stiffness and cycles to failure were documented, pre- and post-test fluoroscopy was performed, and implant and bone kinematics were quantified. Results: During nondestructive testing, the BSM group exhibited significantly increased torsional and axial stiffness compared with the FCL (P = 0.006, P < 0.001) group and ALL group (P < 0.001, P = 0.006). There were no significant differences in resistance to cyclic loading between groups. Fluoroscopic analysis indicated significant differences in the motions of nonlocked cannulated screws (used in BSM and ALL) versus locked screws (used in CTL and FCL). Conclusions: Patients with poor bone quality and proximal humerus fracture may necessitate added compliance or rigidity to achieve fixation. Both have exhibited favorable biomechanical characteristics in this cadaveric 2-part proximal humerus fracture model.

Methods: Using fast, personalized imaging, bone healing models of femur fracture were constructed based on data from multi-slice spiral computed tomography using Mimics, Geomagic Studio, and Abaqus software packages. The intramedullary pin was removed by Boolean operations before fixation was dislodged. Loads were applied on each model to simulate a person standing on one leg. The von Mises stress distribution, maximum stress, and its location was observed. Results: According to 10 kinds of display groups based on material assignment, the nodes of maximum and minimum von Mises stress were the same before and after dislodgement, and all nodes of maximum von Mises stress were outside the fracture line. The maximum von Mises stress node was situated at the bottom quarter of the femur. The von Mises stress distribution was identical before and after surgery. Conclusion: Fast, personalized model establishment can simulate fixation dislodgement before operation, and personalized finite element analysis was performed to successfully predict whether nail dislodgement would disrupt femur fracture or not.

J	Ulla, IA				Arzac Ulla, Ignacio			Persistent instability in pure ligamentous Lisfranc joint injuries	FOOT AND ANKLE SURGERY			English	Article						Lisfranc; Subtle unstable; Stress radiograph; Percutaneous fixation	FRACTURE-DISLOCATIONS; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS	Introduction: Lisfranc injuries refer to a specific group of injuries which lead to instability of the tarsalmetatarsal joint. Our hypothesis is that persistent instability is permanent and asymptomatic in subtle unstable injuries of the medial column which have been fixed percutaneously. Objective: To describe the persistent instability of pure ligamentous Lisfranc joint injuries treated with anatomic reduction and percutaneous screws fixation by comparative radiographs of both feet. Materials and methods: Between 2014 and 2018, 14 patients diagnosed with subtle unstable Lisfranc injury were evaluated. Indications for surgery included widening (diastasis) greater than 2 mm between the first and second metatarsal bases, and subluxation greater than 1 mm of a metatarsal base from its respective tarsal bone. Results: Persistent instability was found on the stress radiographs of 11 patients (78.57% 95% CI: 48.60-95.07%) but without clinical connotations. The average AOFAS score evaluated at 18 months post-operatively was of 97.14 (SD +/- 4.68) points. The median follow-up was 24 (RIQ: 18-24) months. In all patients, anatomical reduction on radiographs was evident. Conclusion: We observed a persistent instability of the Lisfranc joint, without clinical connotations. Subtle unstable Lisfranc injuries treated with percutaneous screw fixation have a good clinical and functional outcome. (C) 2020 European Foot and Ankle Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Material/Methods: Based on the principle of providing both dynamic and static pressure to stabilize the fracture, we improved the dynamic hip screw (DHS) and designed the LDHS. Six fresh cadavers were collected and intertrochanteric fracture models were established, including Evan's type I fracture (n=3) and type II (n=3). We used the left-to-right comparison in this study. LDHS technique was performed on the left femoral head of each cadaver (LDHS group: n=6), while DHS was performed on the right side (DHS group: n=6). After fixation by either LDHS or DHS, compressive strength, rigidity, shear stress and strain, torsional properties, and ultimate loads were measured and compared in both groups. Results: Under the 1200 N pressure, compressive strength, rigidity, shear stress and strain, and ultimate loads of LDHS were better than those of DHS in the 2 groups. All differences were statistically significant. Although LDHS enhanced the torsional properties, there was no significant difference. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that the biomechanical effects of LDHS are superior than those of DHS, and there was no screw failure after implantation. Armed with those better properties, LDHS, as a new internal fixation device, may be a good alternative option in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures.

Materials and methods Between July 2013 and January 2016, 13 patients (7 male and 6 female) who were diagnosed with comminuted inferior pole fracture of the patella in preoperative computed tomography and underwent a minimum of 1 year of follow-up were enrolled in this study. Mean patient age was 57.7 years (range 28-72 years). All patients underwent open reduction and internal fixation by rim-plate-augmented separate vertical wiring. Bony union, complications, range of motion and Bostman score were the clinical outcomes. Results Bony union was achieved in all cases at an average of 10 weeks after surgery (range 8-12). There was no loss of reduction and fixative failure during follow-up. The average range of motion was 127A degrees (range 120A degrees-130A degrees). The mean Bostman score at last follow-up was 29.6 points (range 27-30) and graded excellent in 12 patients. Conclusion Rim-plate-augmented separate vertical wiring demonstrated secure fixation and favorable clinical outcomes. This study provides evidence for its effectiveness as a fixation method for treating displaced, comminuted inferior pole fracture of the patella.

A two-screw construct is commonly used for the surgical treatment of such injury. However, loss of reduction is still a major concern after surgery. To improve the biomechanical strength of screw fixation in GT fractures, we made a simple modification of the two-screw construct by adding a cerclage wire to the two-screw construct. The purpose of this biomechanical study was to analyze the effect of this modification for the fixation of GT fractures. Materials and methods: Sixteen fresh-frozen human cadaveric shoulders were used in this study. The fracture models were arbitrarily assigned to one of two fixation methods. Group A (n = 8) was fixed with two threaded cancellous screws with washers. In group B (n = 8), all screws were set using methods identical to group A, with the addition of a cerclage wire. Horizontal traction was applied via a stainless steel cable fixed directly to the myotendinous junction of the supraspinatus muscle. Displacement of the fracture fixation under a pulling force of 100 N/200 N and loading force to construct failure were measured. Results: The mean displacements under 100 N and 200 N traction force were both significantly decreased in group B than in group A. (100 N: 1.06 +/- 0.12mm vs. 2.26 +/- 0.24 mm, p < 0.001; 200 N: 2.21 +/- 0.25mm vs. 4.94 +/- 0.30 mm, p < 0.001) Moreover, the failure load was significantly higher in group B compared with group A. (415 +/- 52 N vs.335 +/- 47 N, p = 0.01), Conclusions: The current biomechanical cadaveric study demonstrated that the two-screw fixation construct augmented with a cerclage wire has higher mechanical performance than the conventional two-screw configuration for the fixation of humeral GT fractures.

Methods: Data of 14 patients (five women, nine men); aged from 28 to 71 years (mean, 49.9 years) who had undergone surgery for acetabulum top compression fractures with sea gull sign and been followed up were retrospectively analyzed. The time from injury to surgery was 4-14 days (mean, 9 days). All patients underwent open reduction and bone graft and internal fixation through an ilioinguinal or ilioinguinal plus Kocher-Langenbeck approach. Quality of fracture reduction was assessed according to Matta reduction criteria and hip function according to Matta acetabular fracture criteria. Results: Fourteen patients were followed up for 6-60 months (mean, 36 months). All achieved bone healing within 3-4 months (mean, 3.4 months); the excellent and good rate being 78.5% (11/14). The Matta acetabular fracture scores were 10-18 scores (mean, 16.4); the excellent and good rate being 71.4% (10/14). Traumatic arthritis occurred in three patients. Pain was serious in two patients and relieved by total hip joint replacement and mild in one. One patient developed asymptomatic heterotopic ossification postoperatively. Conclusion: The appropriate delay between injury and surgery with acetabular roof compression fracture with sea gull sign is from 5 to 10 days. Through an ilioinguinal or ilioinguinal plus Kocher-Langenbeck approach, excellent reduction of the articular surface can be achieved and sufficient bone graft material obtained.

The aim of this study is to compare the clinical efficacy and complication rates of treatment using suture tape circumferential cerclage (STCC) and metallic wire circumferential cerclage (MWCC) for the surgical treatment of displaced transverse patellar fractures (TPFs).Hypothesis: The hypothesis is that the use of the suture tape would be associated with a significantly lower rate of re-operation than metallic cerclage but no differences in other clinical outcomes. Patients and methods: A retrospective comparative analysis of the clinical outcomes of consecutive patients undergoing fixation of TPFs with either MWCC or STCC between January 2017 and December 2018 was undertaken. All patients underwent evaluation with standardised radiographs at one, three, and six months after surgery to determine rates of union, non-union, loss of fixation and malunion. All patients underwent a final clinical evaluation at 18 months postoperatively to evaluate clinical scores and complications.Results: A total of 26 patients were included in the study. Thirteen patients underwent STCC and 13 underwent MWCC. There were no complications in the STCC group. In the MWCC group, one patient underwent hardware removal at 2 months postoperatively due to painful prominence. There was no significant difference in re-operation rates between the STCC and MWCC groups (p = 1). There were no cases of non-union, malunion or loss of fixation throughout the series. At the final clinical follow-up of 18 months, there were no significant differences in KSS, KOOS or Bostman scores between the groups.Conclusion: No significant differences were identified when comparing the clinical outcomes of fixation of AO/OTA 34C1/2 fractures with suture tape or metallic cerclage fixation concerning re-operation rates, union rates, loss of fixation and functional outcome measures. These results cannot be extrapolated to more complex injury patterns or surgical techniques in which prominence of implanted material is more likely.Level of evidence: III.(c) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, lateral eyebrow incisions have sometimes left unsightly scars, and thus we have used 1-point fixation through a buccogingival incision so as not to leave scars in selected cases. The aim of this study was to compare 1-point fixation in the zygomaticomaxillary (ZM) area with 2-point fixation in the ZM and frontozygomatic (FZ) areas in tripod fractures. Materials and Methods: This study is retrospective and was approved by the institutional review board of our hospital. From November 2005 to March 2010, 30 patients were enrolled in this study. We investigated 14 patients with 1-point fixation in the ZM area (group 1), 1 of whom had bilateral tripod fractures, and 16 patients with 2-point fixation in the ZM and FZ area (group 2). We postoperatively checked for 1) unfavorable scars; 2) bony movement, pain, and palpability in the FZ area; 3) satisfaction with surgical outcomes; 4) presence or absence of surgeries for plate removal; and 5) anxiety about no fixation of the FZ area. Results: Of 16 patients in group 2, 10 (63%) complained of unsightly scars in the lateral eyebrow incision site, whereas none of the patients in group I complained of external scarring. None of the patients complained of bony movement and pain in the FZ area in either group. In group 2, 4 of 16 patients (25%) complained of palpability in the FZ area, whereas none in group 1 complained of palpability. The satisfaction score for surgery was 9.4 1.6 in group 1 and 7.7 +/- 2.6 in group 2 (P <.05). Two patients underwent surgery for plate removal in group 2. None of the patients in group 1 complained of any cosmetic problems, with no fixation in the FZ area. Conclusions: One-point fixation in the ZM area in zygomatic tripod fractures can avoid unsightly scars and give high satisfaction with surgical outcomes in selected patients with tripod fractures.

Material and methods: A total of 104 patients, treated from 2007 to 2012 with 114 class II or class IV fractures according to Spiessl and Schroll were included in this study. Facial nerve function, scarring, pain and functional clinical parameters, such as protrusion, mediotrusion and maximum interincisal distance, were judged clinically (at 21 +/- 12.1 months); repositioning and reossification were measured upon preoperative, postoperative and follow-up (at 8.8 +/- 7 months) radiographs. Patient satisfaction was evaluated using the OHIP-G 14 questionnaire. Results: In all, 36 patients (35%) with 43 fractures (38%) presented for clinical follow-up. Both treatment groups showed clinically and radiologically comparable results. Scarring was obvious in all extraorally treated patients, and hypertrophic scars occurred in four class IV cases (24%). One clas.s IV patient (6%) had a persistent facial nerve palsy; temporary pareses were more frequent (n = 4; 24%). Conclusion: The transoral approach did not jeopardize facial nerve function, and extraoral scars were avoided. Repositioning and fixation results and the frequency of revision operations were comparable. The transoral approach can be recommended generally in class II and class IV cases.

This, in turn, reduces the pain and risks associated with the secondary operation on patients. Although the mechanical properties of bioabsorbable materials have been considerably enhanced via modifications and optimization, the strength and stiffness of these materials are considerably inferior to those of metals. Therefore, whether PLA fixation can satisfy the required mechanical properties has been a consistent subject of interest in clinical practice. In this study, the mechanical properties of PLA bioabsorbable (Changchun SinoBiomaterials Co., Ltd., China) and titanium hollow screws (Shanghai Carefix Medical Instrument Co., Ltd., China) were compared in hallux valgus surgery with chevron osteotomy. Three-dimensionally printed osteotomy guides were used for cutting the artificial first metatarsal model (SKU3422, Sawbones) to reduce the errors due to the variations in individual bone densities and osteotomy angles; the cut parts were subsequently fixed with the PLA and titanium alloy screws. A digital image correlation system was used to obtain the full-field strain of the specimen to evaluate the mechanical behaviors under static and fatigue loads. The experimental results demonstrated that, by designing a reasonable osteotomy angle, the compressive strength of the specimen with PLA screws under chevron osteotomy can be as high as that of the specimen with titanium screws. Moreover, their stiffness can reach up to 60%-90% that of titanium screws. After 240,000 cycles of compression, the PLA screws maintained their strength and stiffness. These bioabsorbable fixtures can effectively prevent stress shielding under a suitable osteotomy. Hence, as an optimal substitute for metal fixtures, an increase in clinical applications to surgery is anticipated, along with progressive in-depth research on the biomechanical properties of bioabsorbable materials.

Materials and methods This was a retrospective cohort study of 26 patients with type B unstable fractures that underwent ASIF/TPS and 26 similar patients that underwent ORIF using plates and screws. Intraoperative blood loss, operating time, and post operation hospitalization duration were compared. Anteroposterior, inlet, and outlet X-rays and 3D computed tomography were obtained. Pain, numbness, sexual dysfunction, and activity were evaluated at every follow-up visit until the implants were removed. The Majeed score was used to assess the clinical and radiological outcomes. Results Blood loss, operating time, and hospitalization duration were less (all P < 0.001) in the ASIF/TPS group compared with the ORIF group. The clinical and radiological outcomes of the ASIF/TPS group after a mean follow-up of 6 months were excellent and good in 80.8%, and moderate in 19.2%. In comparison, the results of the ORIF group were excellent and good in 65.4%, moderate in 29.0%, and poor in 5.6%. No patient experienced nonunion, delayed union, superficial infection, or deep surgical wound infection. No urethral injury or dysuria occurred in the ASIF/TPS group. Two patients had temporary lateral femoral cutaneous nerve numbness after operation. There were two superficial wound infections in the ORIF group. Conclusions The use of ASIF/TPS with triple pedicle screws could be a reasonable option for the treatment of type B unstable pelvic fractures.

There is general agreement that an intracapsular fracture requires conservative treatment, but the treatment of extra-capsular fractures is controversial. Extraoral approaches have different advantages and disadvantages. The possibility of damage to the facial nerve is always present but, in our experience, always recovers in a short time. Materials and methods: From June 2008 to June 2009, we admitted 25 patients with mandibular condylar fractures to our department. Nineteen patients received a retromandibular transparotid approach to identify and stabilize the condylar fracture site. None of them developed infection. Surgical technique: A 2 cm incision extending in the retromandibular hollow is the first step. Initial dissection in a forward and upward in the direction of the SMAS layer is mandatory to gain good mobility of the soft tissue flaps. Blunt dissection through the parotid gland is performed between the marginal and buccal branches of the facial nerve. Periosteal elevation of all the lateral surface of the mandible provides good exposure of the bony surfaces and mobilization of the soft tissues. Conclusions: We believe that this approach is a safe and time sparing alternative to the intraoral endoscopic approach (C) 2011 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.

J	Gear, AJL; Apasova, E; Schmitz, JP; Schubert, W				Gear, AJL; Apasova, E; Schmitz, JP; Schubert, W			Treatment modalities for mandibular angle fractures	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							DYNAMIC COMPRESSION PLATES; LAG-SCREW OSTEOSYNTHESIS; RIGID INTERNAL-FIXATION; MINIPLATE OSTEOSYNTHESIS; NONCOMPRESSION MINIPLATE; FACIAL SKELETON; COMPLICATIONS; EXPERIENCE; SITES	Purpose: Management of mandibular angle fractures is often challenging and results in the highest complication rate among fractures of the mandible. Optimal treatment for angle fractures remains controversial. Historically, treatment of mandible fractures included intraoperative maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) along with rigid internal fixation. More recently, noncompression plates miniplates, which produce only relative stability, have gained popularity. The absolute necessity of intraoperative MMF as an adjunct to internal fixation has also become controversial. The current trends in the management of simple, noncomminuted mandibular angle fractures are examined. Materials and Methods: A survey was submitted to North American and European AO ASIF (Arbeits-gemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen Association for the Study of Internal Fixation) faculty in July 2001. Statistical analysis of results included both Fisher's exact and chi-square tests. Results were considered significant if P < .05. Results: One hundred ten of 127 potential responses were received (87%). Among 104 surgeons who treat mandible fractures, 86 (83%) treat more than 10 mandibular fractures per year. Preferred techniques for simple, noncomminuted mandibular angle fractures in this group were: single miniplate on the superior border (Champy technique) with or without arch bars (44 surgeons, 51%); tension band plate on the superior border and nonlocking, bicortical screw plate on the inferior border (11 surgeons, 13%); dual miniplates (9 surgeons, 10%); a locking screw plate on the inferior border only (6 surgeons, 7%), and 3-dimensional plates (5 surgeons, 6%). Eleven surgeons (13%) gave multiple answers. Although only 13% of surgeons surveyed primarily use the combination of tension band and nonlocking, bicortical screw plates, many surgeons (73%) continue to use this technique in certain circumstances. Within this group, 32 (51%) place screws in a neutral position, while 31 (49%) place screws in an eccentric position, resulting in compression. For simple noncomminuted angle fractures, the number of surgeons performing internal fixation without MMF were: 14 often (16%); 20 occasionally (23%); 17 seldom (20%); and 35 never (41%). Surgeons treating more than 10 versus those who treat less than 10 fractures per year, International versus North American faculty, and Oral and Maxillofacial surgeons (OMS) versus non-OMS surgeons were compared. Surgeons who treat more than 10 fractures per year favor the Champy technique over the tension band and bicortical plate combination (44 [51%] vs 11 [13%]), while those surgeons who treat less than 10 per year favor the tension band and bicortical plate combination over the Champy technique (9 [50%] vs 3 [17%]; P < .01, Fisher exact test). International faculty are less likely to use intraoperative MMF than North American faculty (29 [81%] vs 31 [43%]; P < .01, Fisher exact test). OMS surgeons are less likely to use the tension band and bicortical plate combination than non-OMS surgeons (22 [56%] vs 42 [90%]; P < .017, Fisher exact test). Conclusion: This survey suggests an evolution in the management of mandibular angle fractures. A single miniplate plate on the superior border of the mandible has become the preferred method of treatment among AO faculty. When using large, inferiorly based plates more surgeons are now favoring neutral rather than eccentric screw placement. Intraoperative MMF is not considered mandatory by some surgeons in certain circumstances. (c) 2005 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

Materials and methods 73 consecutive patients were included. 1000 mg TXA was administered intravenously to all patients before surgery. The patients were evaluated on the basis of preoperative, postoperative first and third day hemoglobin-hematocrit values, amount of drainage collected, total blood loss, transfusion rates and complications. Results Mean operative time was 120.1 min. Average decrease in hematocrit levels between preoperative and postoperative first day was 2.1 g/dL. Average collected blood from the drain was 177 mL. Mean total blood loss was 1137 mL. Transfusion rate of the patients was 21%. Mean transfused units was 0.9 units. Three patients died within 3 weeks after the operation due to myocardial infarction, acute kidney failure and pneumonia. There were no cases of symptomatic venous or pulmonary thromboembolism during the 90 days of follow-up. Conclusion Use of TXA in pelvic and acetabular fractures was found to be effective in reducing total blood loss, hemoglobin drop and transfusion rates without increasing venous and pulmonary thromboembolism in our series.

Biomechanical evaluation of a new system to improve screw fixation in osteoporotic bones	MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS			English	Article						Biomechanical testing; Cyclical loads; Osteoporosis; Internal fixation; Screw; Peek; Locking element; Dynamic compression plate; Locking compression plate	LOCKING COMPRESSION PLATE; FINITE-ELEMENT-ANALYSIS; PULLOUT STRENGTH; CORTICAL BONE; MECHANICAL VALIDATION; SPINAL APPLICATIONS; INTERNAL-FIXATION; INSERTION TORQUE; CERVICAL FUSION; HOLDING POWER	In this paper an experimental analysis is undertaken of the affect a new screw-to-bone fixation system has on the stiffness of fixation systems of osteoporotic fractures based on osteosynthesis plates. The proposed system, which we have named the screw locking element (SLE), is made with elements manufactured from a biocompatible polymer material known as polyetheretherketon (PEEK) which act like a lock nut, holding the end of the threaded screw shank after this has passed through both bone corticals. Seventy-two osteoporotic synbone simulated fracture models were instrumented with one of four constructs: locking compression plate with 6 locking screws (LCP), dynamic compression plate with 6 cortical screws (DCP), DCP with 2 SLEs or DCP with 6 SLEs (DCP + 6SLEs). Each group of 18 simulated fracture models were further split into 3 subgroups of 6. One subgroup was tested under cyclic cantilever bending, another under cyclic compression and the third under cyclic torsion. Loss of stiffness was determined in each test every 1,000 load cycles, between 0 and 30,000 cycles. Regardless of the load type, it was seen that the DCP system had the highest stiffness loss percentages of all the tested systems. The inclusion of SLEs significantly decreased the stiffness loss of the DCP system. Unlike the cyclic compression loads, where the LCP performed slightly better, on terminating the cantilever bending and torsion load cycles no statistically significant difference was noted (Tukey test, p > 0.05) between the percentage stiffness loss of the DCP + 6SLEs system and the LCP system. It is concluded that the proposed SLEs enable DCPs to lower the high failure rate that these exhibit in osteoporotic fracture repairs, at significantly lower costs than those resulting from the use of LCPs.

The purpose of the current study was to assess the clinical outcomes and complication rate of a combined fixation technique using cannulated screws and the modified Pyrford technique with nonabsorbable polyester sutures. Methods and patients Between January 2015 and February 2021, 26 transverse patellar fractures were fixed with this combined technique. Preoperative data were collected from patients with transverse patellar fractures who were followed up for at least 12 months. At each follow-up visit, plain radiographs were taken. At the 12-month postoperative follow-up, range of motion of the affected knee joint and clinical outcomes, as evaluated by the Bostman scoring system, were recorded. Results The average Bostman score at the 12-month postoperative follow-up was 28.3 +/- 1.5. Furthermore, the average extension and flexion of the knee joint were 1.2 +/- 2.1 and 125.6 +/- 6.7 degrees, respectively. One patient experienced delayed bone union and one experienced superficial wound infection. There were no other postoperative complications. One patient required removal of the device for social-psychological reasons. Conclusions The combined fixation technique with cannulated screws and the modified Pyrford technique with suture materials produced excellent clinical outcomes and a low rate of complications in the treatment of transverse patellar fractures.

The method solves the problem of the nano-sized particle aggregation in polymer matrix. XRD, TEM and SEM were used to determine component and morphology of the composite. Results indicated that nano-HA particles were dispersed well in CS matrix, which can also be proved by the transparent appearance of composite rod, and that the structure of composite is assembled by CS molecule in the order of layer-by-layer. The mechanical properties of the composite were evaluated by using bending strength and modulus, and compared with some other bone replacement materials such as PMMA and bone cement. The initial mechanical properties of bending strength and modulus of composite are 86 MPa and 3.4 GPa, respectively, which is double or triple times stronger than that of PMMA and bone cement. It was found that the bending strength and modulus of CS/HA with ratio of 10015 (wt/wt) is slightly higher than that of pure CS rod. The addition of HA can also reduce the ratio of water absorption of composite, which postponed the retention of mechanical properties of CS/HA composite under moisture condition. The phenomenon can be predicted with the fit exponential function according the data measured. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Calcium sulfate/hydroxyapatite (CaS/HA) is a biomaterial that can be used for augmenting fracture fixation. We aimed to determine whether an injection of 2 ml CaS/HA increases the fixation of a dynamic hip screw inserted in synthetic and human trabecular bone. The study consists of two parts: 1) synthetic bone blocks (n = 74), with three subgroups: empty (cannulated screw, no injection), cannulated, and fenestrated; and 2) osteoporotic human femoral heads (n = 29), with the same subgroups. The heads were imaged using mu CT. Bone volume fraction, insertion angle, and head diameter were measured. Pullout tests were performed and peak force, stiffness, and work were measured. The fenestrated group showed increases in pullout strength compared to no injection in the synthetic blocks. The cannulated group showed a higher pullout strength in lowdensity blocks. In the femoral heads, the variation was larger and there were no significant differences between groups. The bone volume fraction correlated with the peak force and work, and the insertion angle correlated with the stiffness. CaS/HA can improve the fixation of a dynamic hip screw. For clinical use, spreading of the material around the threads of the screw must be ensured. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IPEM.

Specific reports of treatment of unstable C1 fractures involving the lateral mass are still scarce. We therefore present this report to evaluate the effectiveness of posterior C1-C2 screw-rod fixation and fusion for unstable C1 fractures involving the lateral mass. Material/Methods: From June 2009 to June 2016 in our hospital, 16 cases were diagnosed with C1 fractures involving the lateral mass and treated by posterior C1-C2 screw-rod fixation and fusion. The patients' clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative and postoperative images were taken to evaluate cervical sequence, location of screws, and bone fusion. Neurological status and neck pain levels were evaluated clinically on follow-up. Results: All patients underwent surgery successfully. The mean follow-up duration was 15.3 +/- 4.9 months (range 9-24 months). All patients obtained satisfying clinical outcomes with good neck pain alleviation, appropriate screw placement, and reliable bone fusion. None of the patients developed vascular or neurological complications during the operation or follow-up. Conclusions: Posterior C1-C2 screw-rod fixation and fusion is an effective management for unstable C1 fractures involving the lateral mass. This operation can provide reliable stabilization and satisfactory bone fusion.

Long-term outcomes of atrophic/oligotrophic non-unions in dogs and cats treated with autologous iliac corticocancellous bone graft and circular external skeletal fixation: 19 cases (2014-2021)	JOURNAL OF SMALL ANIMAL PRACTICE			English	Article							PLATELET-RICH PLASMA; RADIOGRAPHIC MEASUREMENT; FRACTURES; NONUNION; ANGLES; RISK; MANAGEMENT; ALLOGRAFTS; AUTOGRAFT; RADIUS	Objectives: To determine the short- and long-term outcomes and complications in dogs and cats undergoing surgical treatment for viable oligotrophic and nonviable atrophic non-unions using circular external skeletal fixation and autologous corticocancellous bone graft.Materials and Methods: In this case series, the medical records and radiographs of all dogs and cats with radius/ulna and tibia/fibula viable oligotrophic and nonviable atrophic non-unions treated with corticocancellous bone graft and circular external skeletal fixation at two referral veterinary hospitals between 2014 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. The long-term follow-up was 1 year or greater.Results: Thirteen dogs and six cats with 19 non-union fractures met the inclusion criteria for the study. Eighteen non-union fractures (94.7%) healed and one did not. Five patients (26%) had minor perioperative period complications (<3 months). The patient that did not achieve bone union underwent revision surgery with internal fixation (plate and screws) and autologous cancellous bone graft. Fifteen (78.9%) cases returned to full function and three (15.8%) cases returned to acceptable function in the long-term follow-up period.Clinical Significance: The use of circular external skeletal fixation associated with autologous corticocancellous bone graft for the treatment of radius/ulna and tibia/fibula atrophic/oligotrophic non-union fractures in dogs and cats was considered successful in the majority of patients and was free of major or catastrophic complications.

It mainly causes soft tissue problems due to the absorption of a large amount of energy by the soft tissues and bone tissues. Although some recent treatment protocols have eliminated many problems regarding delayed soft tissue closure, it still remains a big challange. This study uses a method called the internal fixator technique with noncontact locking plate (NC-LP) which involves the use of a combination of advantages of open and closed fixation techniques. Materials and Methods: 42 patients (32 men and 10 women) having a mean age of 34.11 years (range 17-56 years) with open fractures operated using internal fixator technique between 2007 and 2012 were included in this study. A retrospective chart review was conducted to record the following: age, gender, anatomic region of fractures, fracture etiology, classification of open fractures by Gustilo-Anderson and AO classification, surgeries, length of hospitalization, location and pattern of fracture, length of followup, and complications. Results: The fractures were caused by traffic accidents, shotgun injuries, falls from heights, and industrial crush injuries. Based on the Gustilo-Anderson classification, 31 fractures were Type III and 11 were Type II, where 23 were localized in the tibia and 19 in the femur. Patients delay for a mean of 13.5 h (range 6-24 h) for operation and the mean followup interval was 27.8 months (range 16-44 months). The mean union time was 19.7 weeks (range 16-29 weeks). One patient had delayed union and implant failure, one patient had osteomyelitis, five suffered from surface skin necrosis, and one patient had an angulation of 17 degrees in the sagittal plane, for which no additional intervention was performed. Conclusions: This case series demonstrates that an "internal fixator technique" is an acceptable alternative to the management of open fractures of the femur or tibia in adult patients. The NC-LP method provided opportunities to achieve a stable fixation with noncontact between the implant and the bone tissues, and the fractures were sufficiently stabilized to allow union with a low complication rate.

There is a lack of use of decision aids in the orthopedic literature. The purpose of this study was to develop a decision board to elicit preferences for treatment of displaced femoral neck fractures in patients over 60 years old. Materials and Methods: We developed a decision board presenting descriptions and potential outcomes and complications of two treatment options, hemiarthroplasty (HA) and internal fixation (IF), for displaced femoral neck fractures. Five orthopedic surgeons evaluated the face and content validity of the decision board and 10 volunteers completed "scope tests" to determine the comprehensibility. We then presented the decision board to 108 study participants faced with the scenario of sustaining a displaced femoral neck fracture. Participants stated their preference for operative procedure and described the reasons for their choices. Results: The decision board achieved good face and content validity. All participants in the scope tests appropriately switched their preference to the other modality when probabilities were altered. Most participants found the decision board easy to understand and helpful in making an informed decision. Also, most participants were satisfied with the amount of information presented and with the use of the decision board as a decision making tool. Sixty-one participants (56) chose IF as their operative procedure of choice quoting less blood loss, shorter operative time, and less invasiveness as the top factors that contributed to this choice. Participants who preferred HA (44) did so primarily due to the lower re-operation rate. Conclusions: The decision board is a useful and reliable tool to inform patients about the treatment options for displaced femoral neck fractures. They should be utilized by surgeons to incorporate patients preferences into the decision-making process.

The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of our modified anterolateral approach for Holsteine-Lewis humeral fractures and document clinical and functional results. Materials and methods: Between 2008 and 2014, 18 patients (mean age 35.4 years) with a Holsteine Lewis humeral shaft fracture who underwent open reduction and internal fixation with a plate and screws using the modified anterolateral approach and followed for a minimum of 12 months were included. Radiologic fracture configurations, number of distal cortical fixations, union rate, and time to union were analyzed. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Mayo elbow performance index system, range of elbow motion, and postoperative complications. Results: Mean fracture length was 60.2 +/- 10.2 mm (range 49.2-77.2) and mean distal cortical length was 41.4 +/- 7.04 mm (range 22.8-59.6). Distal fragments were fixed at a minimum of six cortical points (range 6-8) in all cases using the modified anterolateral approach. Average time to union was 10.5 weeks (range 8-12 weeks). All cases of radial nerve palsy completely recovered within 3 months. Mean elbow range of motion at final follow-up was 3.2 degrees of flexion contracture (range 0-10) and 135.4 degrees of further flexion (range 120-140), and the average Mayo elbow performance score was 96.3 points (range 90-100). There were no non-union or metal failures. Conclusions: The results obtained indicate that the modified anterolateral approach is a safe and easy accessible method that provides sufficient distal osseous fixation for HolsteineLewis humeral shaft fractures without serious complications. The modified anterolateral approach for plate osteosynthesis appears to be one of the most available options for the treatment of HolsteineLewis humeral fractures.

Aim of the study was to find the single best and combination of radiographic projections to reliably detect screw cut outs. Materials and methods: The locking plate was fixed to six cadaveric proximal humeri. Six different radiographs were performed: anteriorposterior in internal (apIR), in neutral (ap0) and in 30 degrees external rotation (apER); axial in 30 degrees (ax30) and 60 degrees (ax60) abduction and an outlet view. Each head screw (n = 9) was sequentially exchanged to perforate the humeral head with the tip and all radiographs were repeated for each cut out. Randomized image reading by two blinded examiners for cut out was done for single projection and combinations. Results: Interrater agreement was 0.72-0.93. Best single projection was ax30 (sensitivity 76%) and the worst was the outlet view (sens. 17%). Standard combination of apIR/outlet reached a sens. of 54%. The best combination of two was: apER/ax30 (90% sens.), of three: apIR/apER/ax30 (96% sens.) and of four: apIR/ap0/apER/ax30 (100% sens.). Conclusion: Standard radiographs (ap/outlet), especially in internal rotation, may miss nearly half of screw cut outs. Single best radiographic projection was an axial view with 30 degrees abduction. To account for all cut outs and correct screw position a combination of four projections was needed. These simple and feasible intraoperative and postoperative radiographs help to detect screw perforations of the locking plate reliably. Level of evidence: I (Study of Diagnostic Test).

Primary stability of an intramedullary calcaneal nail and an angular stable calcaneal plate in a biomechanical testing model of intraarticular calcaneal fracture	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Calcaneal fracture; Reduction techniques; Minimum invasive approach; Fracture fixation; Intramedullary nail; Angular stable plate; Biomechanics; In vitro testing; Primary stability	OPERATIVE TREATMENT; INTERNAL-FIXATION; SCREW FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; COMPLICATIONS; INJURIES; LOCKING; TRIAL	Background: Nowadays, open anatomic reduction and internal fixation can be considered as a valuable treatment for displaced intra-articular fractures of the calcaneus. However, the application of a calcaneal plate via an extensile lateral approach is at risk for a substantial rate of complications including delayed healing, skin necrosis, or infection. There is some evidence that a limited exposure might contribute to a decreased soft tissue complication rate bearing in mind that most minimally invasive techniques have to accept a reduced primary stability compared with the open application of an angular stable plate. Recently, an intrafocal minimal invasive reduction technique has been established employing an intramedullary nail for fracture stabilisation and support of the subtalar joint. The aim of this study was to compare the primary biomechanical performance of the new device versus lateral angular stable plating. Material and methods: Biomechanical testings were performed on 14 human cadaveric feet (7 pairs). Dry calcaneal bones were fractured resulting in a Sanders type IIB fracture pattern and fixed by either a calcaneal locking plate or an intramedullary calcaneal nail. Compressive testing via the corresponding talus was employed at a constant loading velocity until failure with an universal testing machine and a specific mounting device to avoid any shear forces. Apart from the data of the load deformation diagram the relative motion of the fracture elements during loading was recorded by 8 extensometric transducers. After failure the specimens were carefully examined to check the failure patterns. Results: The displacement of the subtalar joint fragment was substantially lower in specimens fixed with the nail. Stiffness and load to failure were significantly higher after fixation with the intramedullary nail than after application of the angular stable plate. Failure with both fixation modes generally occurred at the anterior calcaneal process fragment. Conclusions: The primary stability of an intramedullary nail appeared to be superior to an angular stable plate representing the present standard technique in open reconstruction of the fractured calcaneus. The results from the experimental model speak in favour of the clinical use of the intramedullary calcaneal nail. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Materials and methods This retrospective study was conducted on 78 patients with unilateral calcaneal fracture who underwent OR/IF. A mean follow-up period was 45.8 months (range 12-135). Two weeks after surgery, the range of motion (ROM) exercise was started, brace or heel off shoe was applied, and forefoot weight-bearing was allowed. Four weeks after surgery, tolerable weight-bearing ambulation without crutch was allowed. When the patient was not walking, the braces were removed to perform peritalar ROM exercises. Radiologic evaluation was performed by measuring the Bohler angle and incongruency of the subtalar joint surface. Paley grade was used to assess traumatic arthritis. Clinical evaluation was performed by measuring the foot and ankle outcome score (FAOS) and ankle ROM. Results The mean postoperative Bohler angle was 31.7 degrees (P < 0.001) at 2 weeks, 31.2 degrees at 3 months, and 30.1 degrees at the last (P = 0.4). The average Paley grade of the subtalar OA was 1.12. CT imaging revealed that the average step-off of the subtalar joint was 1.26 mm in coronal and 0.84 mm in sagittal. The average ROM results were as follows (contralateral, affected side): there was no significant difference in dorsiflexion [16.9 degrees vs. 16 degrees (P = 0.6)], whereas plantarflexion and inversion were significantly decreased [39.5 degrees vs. 35.3 degrees (P = 0.049) and 50.5 degrees vs. 34.8 degrees (P = 0.04)]. The average FAOS score was 86.1 points, and the highest score was "function" (mean 92.5 points). Conclusions Earlier rehabilitation after OR/IF is recommended for the treatment of calcaneal fracture.

An Alternative Site for Pin Placement in External Fixation of Pelvic Fractures: Lateral Posterior Pelvic External Fixator Surgical Technique	FRONTIERS IN SURGERY			English	Article						pelvic fracture; polytrauma; external fixation; damage-control orthopedics; lateral posterior external fixator		Introduction: The application of an external fixator for unstable pelvic fractures is an important component of many resuscitation protocols. Moreover, certain pelvic fractures may be treated with an external fixator without requiring further internal fixation. We report our initial clinical results with an alternate pelvic external fixator site, the lateral posterior external fixator (LPEF), and describe the surgical technique. Methods and Materials: From 2010 to 2013, we identified 27 consecutive patients (mean age 44.6 years, range 18-80 years) treated by the same surgeon (MKR) with an LPEF in a level 1 trauma center. Retrospective data collection included mechanism of injury, surgical interventions, and complications. Results: The LPEF was used in 16 patients as acute pelvic stabilization and converted at a median of 2 days (interquartile range 1-3.5) to internal fixation, whereas in 10 patients, it was used as definitive treatment and removed at a median of 48 days (interquartile range 37-64). One patient died on day 14, secondary to his severe closed head injury. The only surgical complications were two wound infections (20%, 2/10 in the group of definitive LPEFs), which resolved without sequelae after the removal of the LPEF (at 36 and 50 days) and antibiotics, one case of loss of fixation leading to the removal of the LPEF at 71 days, and one patient who had hypergranulating external fixator sites and eventually healed without any cutaneous sequelae. All fractures consolidated in a good position. Discussion: The described techniques of pelvic external fixation include the anterosuperior (iliac wing), supra-acetabular (anteroinferior), and subcristal (anterior superior iliac spine) insertion sites. The reported infection rates in definitive pelvic fracture treatment range from 20 to 40%. Due to the localization of the insertion sites, the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is potentially at risk with the last two techniques. On the other hand, the LPEF insertion site is quite safe, as it is anatomically far from any nerves and the inguinal region, and allows easy access for laparotomy. The results in this series suggest that the lateral posterior pelvic external fixator technique is an alternative to previous techniques with a low risk of complications.

We analyzed the frequency and risk factors for SCN injury after clavicle mid-shaft fracture surgery via open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) versus minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) Materials and methods We retrospectively reviewed the cases from 59 patients who had undergone surgery for clavicle mid-shaft fractures between January 2018 and April 2019. Twenty-nine patients had undergone ORIF and 30 had undergone MIPO. The frequency of SCN injury in the two groups was evaluated, and preoperative patient demographics (age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol, diabetes mellitus, and trauma mechanism), and radiological parameters (fracture displacement and shortening) were measured and evaluated as risk factors for SCN injury. When neurological symptoms, such as numbness, were present on the anterior chest wall or at the incision site, electromyography (EMG) was conducted. Results Neurological symptoms were present in 12 patients. Numbness in the anterior upper chest around the incision site was present in eight and four patients who underwent ORIF and MIPO, respectively (p < 0.001). Furthermore, fracture displacement evaluated on preoperative three-dimensional computed tomography was significantly associated with the occurrence of SCN injury in patients who underwent MIPO (odds ratio, 1.038; 95% confidence interval, 1.001-1.077; p = 0.047). Although EMG was conducted in all patients with SCN injury, peripheral neuropathy was not found in any cases. Conclusions SCN injury, which is a possible complication of clavicle mid-shaft fracture surgery, occurred significantly less frequently in MIPO than in ORIF. In MIPO, greater preoperative fracture displacement was associated with a higher risk of SCN injury. Additional studies are required to reach a consensus regarding accurate methods to evaluate SCN injuries.

Hard and soft tissue changes and long-term stability after vertical height reduction genioplasty using biodegradable fixation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article						vertical height reduction genioplasty; biodegradable fixation; vertical macrogenia	ADVANCEMENT GENIOPLASTY; INTERNAL-FIXATION; DEVICES; CHIN	The aim of this work was to analyse the stability of vertical height reduction genioplasty using biodegradable material, as well as to determine vertical changes of hard and soft tissues during this procedure. Forty patients underwent vertical height reduction genioplasty using two types of biodegradable fixation (Biosorb FX (R) or OSTEOTRANS-MX (R)), combined with mandibular setback surgery. We assessed lateral cephalographs over time (preoperation; immediately post-operation; 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post-operation). We found a mean vertical difference of 0.22 mm (standard deviation (SD) = 0.49 mm) at the menton point immediately post-operation, compared with 12 months post-operation. And there was no statistical significance(P > 0.05). The chin hard tissue remained stable from the immediate post-operation period to 1 year post-operation, and the chin soft tissue remained stable from 3 months to 1 year post-operation. The regression equation describing the replacement of hard tissue with soft tissue change, between pre-operation and 12 months post-operation is y = 0.590x + 0.885 (R-2 = 0.300, P < 0.001). We confirm that the use of biodegradable fixation is a stable method, in terms of skeletal tissues, and a relatively stable method, in terms of soft tissues. In vertical height reduction genioplasty, soft tissue does not reflect 100% of the vertical tissue reduction in hard tissues. This data may influence establishment of surgical treatment objectives.

An attracting alternative method of fixation is the titanium elastic nailing (TEN). However, prospective randomized studies comparing the two methods of fixation are lacking. We assessed the effectiveness of minimally invasive antegrade TEN and plating technique for the treatment of DMCF. Materials and Methods: 80 unilateral displaced midclavicular fractures operated between October 2010 and May 2013 were included in study. This prospective comparative study was approved by the local ethical committee. Followups were at 2nd and 6th weeks and subsequently at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months postoperatively. Primary outcome was measured by the Constant score, union rate and difference in clavicular length after fracture union. Secondary outcome was measured by operative time, intraoperative blood loss, wound size, cosmetic results and complications. Results: During analysis, we had 37 patients in the plate group and 34 patients in the TEN group. There was no significant difference in Constant scores between the two groups. However, faster fracture union, lesser operative time, lesser blood loss, easier implant removal and fewer complications were noted in the TEN group. Conclusion: The use of minimally invasive antegrade TEN for fixation of displaced midshaft clavicle fractures is recommended in view of faster fracture union, lesser morbidity, better cosmetic results, easier implant removal and fewer complications; although for comminuted fractures plating remains the procedure of choice.

Open reduction internal fixation <i>versus</i> hemiarthroplasty <i>versus</i> total hip arthroplasty in the elderly: a review of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database	JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Total hip arthroplasty; Hip fractures; Open reduction internal fixation; Hemiarthoplasty; Femoral neck fractures	FEMORAL-NECK FRACTURES; DISPLACED FRACTURES; METAANALYSIS; MANAGEMENT; CONTROVERSIES; REPLACEMENT; MORTALITY; CARE	Background: Total hip arthroplasty (THA), hemiarthroplasty (HA), and open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) are treatment options for femoral neck fractures. However, the optimal surgical treatment remains unclear. The present study aimed to describe the 30-d postoperative outcomes of THA, HA, and ORIF among patients aged >= 65 y with femoral neck fractures within a national surgical database. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program for January 2005 through December 2009 was conducted. We included patients aged >= 65 y who had undergone THA, HA, or ORIF for femoral neck fractures. We collected information on patient demographics, comorbidities, risk factors, and complication rates. A logistic regression model was used to assess the variation in overall morbidity and mortality after surgery. Results: Overall, 3423 patients met the inclusion criteria: 674 underwent ORIF, 428 HA, and 2321 THA. Most patients were white (83.6%, n = 2862), female (64.4%, n = 2204), and >70 y old (78.4%, n = 2682). On adjusted multivariate analysis, no differences were found in the 30-d mortality rates among the ORIF, HA, and THA groups. Patients who underwent ORIF (odds ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.27-0.94) and HA (odds ratio 0.43, 95% confidence interval 0.22-0.84) had a lower likelihood of developing respiratory complications compared with those who underwent THA. Conclusions: No differences were found in the 30-d mortality rates among the ORIF, HA, and THA groups. ORIF and HA resulted in a lower likelihood of developing respiratory complications than THA.

Although multiple methods have been developed for reduction malarplasty, including a variety of infracture techniques, most of the current procedures have limitations. In the current study we created a new infracture method to circumvent these shortcomings. Material/Methods: Between January 2004 and October 2013, we applied this novel infracture technique in 700 patients. The highest area of the zygomatic body was marked pre-operatively and ground intra-operatively through an intraoral incision. An L-shaped incomplete osteotomy of the zygomatic body was performed with a reciprocating saw, and then a complete perpendicular osteotomy (1 cm anterior to the articular tubercle of the zygomatic arch) was made through a pre-auricular incision. Light pressure on the posterior part of the arch produced a greenstick fracture of the anterior osteotomy site, resulting in posterior-inward repositioning of the malar complex. Internal fixation was not required. Results: Satisfactory aesthetic results and good post-operative stability were achieved. Three months post-operatively, the bone around the zygomatic arc osteotomy line was remodeled. The bone posterior to the articular tubercle of the zygomatic arch was partially absorbed, leading to a depression of the root of the arc and a natural transition on both sides of the osteotomy line, making the midface more slender. Instead, the anterior bone presented with new bones, making the malar complex more stable. Conclusions: This new method has multiple advantages, including simple manipulation, no need for internal fixation, short operative and recovery times, and few complications. X-ray images showing the bony changes demonstrated that the infracture technique is an effective and ideal method for reduction malarplasty.

With excellent biocompatibility and corrosion resistance, titanium-niobium alloys have the potential to become a new generation of internal fixation materials for fractures. However, the role and mechanism of titanium-niobium alloys on promoting fracture healing are still undefined. Therefore, in this study, we systematically evaluated the bone-enabling properties of Ti45Nb via in vivo and in vitro experiments. In vitro, we found that Ti45Nb has an excellent ability to promote MC3T3-E1 cell adhesion and proliferation without obvious cytotoxicity. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and alizarin red staining and semiquantitative analysis showed that Ti45Nb enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells compared to the Ti6Al4V control. In the polymerase chain reaction experiment, the expression of osteogenic genes in the Ti45Nb group, such as ALP, osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OCN), type 1 collagen (Col-1) and runt-related transcription factor-2 (Runx2), was significantly higher than that in the control group. Meanwhile, in the western blot experiment, the expression of osteogenic-related proteins in the Ti45Nb group was significantly increased, and the expression of PI3K-Akt-related proteins was also higher, which indicated that Ti45Nb might promote fracture healing by activating the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. In vivo, we found that Ti45Nb implants accelerated fracture healing compared to Ti6Al4V, and the biosafety of Ti45Nb was confirmed by histological evaluation. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining confirmed that Ti45Nb may promote osteogenesis by upregulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Our study demonstrated that Ti45Nb exerts an excellent ability to promote fracture healing as well as enhance osteoblast differentiation by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and its good biosafety has been confirmed, which indicates its clinical translation potential.

A Retrospective Analysis	GERIATRIC ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY & REHABILITATION			English	Article						volar open reduction internal fixation; distal radius fracture; hand therapy; mobilization	FOREARM FRACTURES; RELIABILITY; MOTION; DISABILITY; THERAPIST; RANGE; PLATE; HAND; PAIN	Study design: The study was a retrospective cohort analysis for a 41 month period; from January 2013 to May 2016. Introduction: It is suggested that patients following a distal radius fracture (DRF) achieve a comparable outcome at 3 and 6 months post surgery regardless of the time they begin mobilization. In previous studies there has been limited analysis of outcomes within the initial 3 months: functional return, time taken from work and use of therapy resources are key outcomes which have not formally been investigated in previous studies. Purpose of the study: To analyze short term outcomes of patients following open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) for a DRF. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted to determine primarily if there is a difference in time from work, number of therapy appointments, cost of therapy materials, time to discharge from therapy and secondarily range of motion (ROM) and grip strength (GS); when measured in patients who begin mobilization prior to 2 weeks compared to those who begin mobilization at 4 or greater weeks post surgery. Results: Patients mobilized early were discharged from hand therapy significantly quicker (p = 0.033) and returned to work significantly faster (p = 0.019) than those mobilized later. Patients who began mobilization at 2 weeks or earlier post surgery had significantly greater wrist extension/flexion arc at 4 weeks (p < 0.001) and 6 weeks (p < 0.001) and rotation at 4 weeks (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Patients who begin mobilization at 2 weeks or earlier following ORIF for a DRF will lose less time from work and will be discharged sooner from hand therapy. They will additionally have increased ROM in the early post surgery phase.

Ideal management of these fractures, as discussed in the literature, is controversial. Some recent meta-analyses have favored open reduction and internal fixation using various approaches. A strictly transoral approach has been described to minimize scarring and risk of facial nerve injury but has restricted visibility. This retrospective study analyzed outcomes of patients with unilateral mandibular condyle fractures who were treated by open reduction and internal fixation through an endoscopic-assisted transoral approach. Materials and Methods: This study included 40 patients who were operated on from January 2015 through December 2016. All patients underwent surgery for a condylar process fracture using an endoscopic-assisted transoral approach. Fracture classification, demographic, and outcome data were collected. Results: Most condylar process fractures were caused by falls from a height less than 3 m. Most were condylar base fractures and classified according to Spiessl and Schroll as Classes I and II. Sixteen patients showed a preoperative malocclusion, whereas 2 patients showed a slight postoperative malocclusion. In cases in which only 1 plate could be placed, the proximal fragment was shorter. A higher Spiessl and Schroll class showed a tendency toward longer operation times. For postoperative outcomes, 1 case of temporary facial palsy was the worst complication (2.5%), 2 cases exhibited minimal occlusal interference (5%), and 1 case exhibited a deviated mouth opening (2.5%). Ramus height was restored in all cases. No chronic pain was found in any cases. Conclusions: It is feasible to treat condylar process fractures in a safe manner using a transoral approach with endoscopic assistance and angled instruments without facial scarring and at a low complication rate. The endoscope improves the restricted visibility of the transoral approach, although a learning curve is necessary This applies especially to dislocated fractures or to fractures with a short proximal fragment.

Rigid sternal fixation in the management of pediatric postmedian sternotomy mediastinitis: A 20-year study	JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY			English	Article						Mediastinitis; Pectoralis flaps; Resorbable plates; Sternal plates; Congenital; Cardiac	VACUUM-ASSISTED CLOSURE; MEDIAN STERNOTOMY; POSTOPERATIVE MEDIASTINITIS; CARDIAC-SURGERY; RISK-FACTORS; MUSCLE FLAP; RECONSTRUCTION; INFECTION; WOUNDS; DEBRIDEMENT	Background and aim: Pediatric patients are at a risk of mediastinitis, a life-threatening complication of median sternotomy, following cardiac surgery for congenital conditions. Our experience with rigid internal sternal fixation in pediatric patients with postmedian sternotomy mediastinitis is presented. Methods and materials: A retrospective chart review was performed of patients <18 years of age diagnosed with postoperative mediastinitis between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2009. Charts were reviewed for demographic data, cardiac history, causative microorganism, and infectious risk factors. The methods of surgical intervention including flap coverage and use and type of sternal plating (resorbable and/or titanium) were also recorded. The primary end point of interest was overall survival. Results: Twenty-five pediatric patients were diagnosed with postoperative mediastinitis. Rigid fixation of the sternum following debridement was performed in 20 patients (age range: 1 month-18 years), all of whom successfully tolerated the procedure. Resorbable plates were used in 13 patients. Five patients did not undergo rigid fixation due to either serious ill-health or lack of adequate sternal bone stock. No patient experienced recurrent sternal wound infection. A total of 20 patients (80%) survived to discharge. Three patients succumbed to their heart condition prior to rigid fixation, one died following sternal closure from unrelated causes, and one patient was lost to follow-up. Conclusions: Post-sternotomy mediastinitis in pediatric patients may be addressed using wide debridement, rigid sternal fixation, and flap coverage.

J	Ni, M; Mei, J; Li, K; Niu, WX; Zhang, M				Ni, Ming; Mei, Jiong; Li, Kun; Niu, Wenxin; Zhang, Ming			The primary stability of different implants for intra-articular calcaneal fractures: an in vitro study	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE			English	Article						Calcaneal fractures; Absorbable screw; Fracture fixation; Internal fixation; In-vitro experiment	CLOSED REDUCTION; SCREW FIXATION; LONG-TERM; PLATE; MANAGEMENT; SURGERY; MODEL	Background: Calcaneal fractures account for around 2% of all fractures and most of them are intra-articular fractures. Many implants have been used in the fixation of calcaneal fractures, but their biomechanical stability has not yet been well investigated. The aim of this study was to compare the primary stability of four fixations of calcaneal fracture. Methods: Eight cadaveric calcaneus samples were used to simulate the Sanders' types III fracture pattern and fixed through four different implants, namely, K-wires, cannulated screws (CS), absorbable screws (AS), and plate-screw system (PSS). Each specimen was then placed into a custom-made jig and was loaded through a material testing machine to simulate the physiological condition. The primary stability was measured in the vertical direction as the stiffness and anterior-posterior direction as the calcaneocuboid force. One-way analysis of variance was used for data analysis. Results: The results showed the highest stiffness of 634 (383-891; SD 226) N/mm in the intact model. It was significantly higher than the models fixed with K-wires, CS or PSS. There was no significant difference in vertical stiffness between fractures fixed with AS and the intact model or other fixed models. The intact model showed the lowest calcaneocuboid force of 153 (120-218; SD 39) N, while the fractures fixed with AS showed the greatest force of 242 (146-398; SD 84) N. The significance was only detected between these two models. Conclusions: The global stiffness was similar when the calcaneal fractures were fixed by K-wires, CS and PSS. The stability of the AS fixation differed along both the vertical and anterior-posterior directions, and was greatly influenced by the bone quality. AS for fracture fixation should be designed with greater strength and pull-out resistance.

The present study aimed to compare patients treated with minimally invasive osteosynthesis through a minimum lateral approach and internal fixation with patients that were treated using internal fixation with an extended lateral side approach in cases of intra-articular calcaneal fractures with thalamic fracture. Patients were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively by performing clinical and imagistic examinations, with radiography scans of the anterior-posterior calcaneal profile and computer tomography. Furthermore, preoperative and postoperative analyses of the Bohler angle on the radiological profile, complications and duration of the hospital admission for both groups were performed. There were 36 patients (39 calcaneal fractures) in group 1 and 24 patients (29 calcaneal fractures) in group 2. The results demonstrated no statistically significant differences in the preoperative (P=0.72) and postoperative (P=0.20) Bohler angle values. The postoperative Bohler angle average values were 26.9 in group 1 and 29.3 in group 2. A total of 11 patients were treated with Kirschner wires inserted in the calcaneus, and in 2/ll cases, one of the brooches registered a migration movement. There were no cases of material migration in the fractures that were stabilized by inserting Kirschner brooches up to the astragalus and cuboid bones. Taken together, the results of the present study demonstrated no significant differences in the Bohler angle values between the minimally invasive and open reduction techniques. However, the antibiotic therapy period, as well as the infection rate were lower in patients that were treated using the minimally invasive technique, suggesting that this technique was superior with respect to lower complication rates and improved functional results.

Materials and Methods: A modified peri-angular incision is used to approach a fractured condyle through the anteroparotid transmasseteric approach. Results: In the authors' experience, this method provides quick and clean exposure to the fractured condylar base and neck fractures for open reduction and internal fixation. Conclusion: Although the peri-angular approach has been discussed in the literature, the authors' modification lessens the chance of complications, such as marginal nerve injury and parotid fistula formation, because the nerve is visualized and kept isolated throughout.

Titanium Three Dimensional Miniplate versus Conventional Titanium Miniplate in Fixation of Anterior Mandibular Fractures	LIFE SCIENCE JOURNAL-ACTA ZHENGZHOU UNIVERSITY OVERSEAS EDITION			English	Article						symphyseal mandibular fracture; parasymphyseal mandibular fracture; titanium miniplate; titanium 3D miniplate	LAG-SCREW FIXATION; ANGLE FRACTURES; OSTEOSYNTHESIS	The optimal management of symphyseal and parasymphyseal fractures continues to evolve. Fractures in this area of the mandible predispose the patients to malocclusion and widening of the face if not properly treated. The current understanding of the biomechanics and fracture healing of the mandible has influenced the modern approach to the open reduction and internal fixation of these fractures. A total of 20 patients were managed by open reduction and internal fixation utilizing the conventional titanium mini-plate and 3dimensional mini-plate for fractures of anterior mandible. The patients were randomly divided into two equal groups according to the type of hardware used for fracture fixation. Group I: (10 patients) were treated with two 2.0 mm titanium mini-plates, Group II: (10 patients) were treated with 3D rectangular mini-plates. Intraoperatively duration of surgery was measured from the time of incision till the closure of wound. Subsequent postoperative clinical follow up for malocclusion, neurosensory deficit, wound breakdown, infection and presence of mal-union/non union was performed. Postoperative radiographs were taken to assess the gap between fracture segments. All patients were followed up clinically and radiographically for 6 months postoperatively. The mean duration of surgery (hours) was 1.88 +/- 0.38 for group I and 1.61 +/- 0.27 for group II. The difference was found to be statistically significant (p value 0.001). There was no clinical evidence of neurosensory deficits due to surgery in all cases. No problems of wound healing, swelling, discoloration, or discharge were seen during follow-up expect one patient in group I showed slight wound dehiscence with exposure of upper plate at the second post-operative week. Post-operative radiographic examination revealed that the fracture line could not be detected on the radiographs after 6 months in six patients (60%) patients in group I and eight patients (80%) patients in group II. The 3D mini-plate system is a better and easier method for fixation of mandibular fractures, compared to the conventional mini-plate. But there is limitation to use in cases of oblique fractures and those involving the mental nerve as well as there is excessive implant material because of the extra vertical bars. [Mahmoud E.

While many techniques are available to fuse the ankle, current recommendations favor the use of internal fixation with screws and/or plates. Despite of progress, the complication rate remains a major concern. Non-union is one difficult problem especially with difficult bone conditions, particularly the loss of bone stock on the talar side. Therefore, fusion of the tibiotalar joint is often extended to the talocalcaneal joint to provide sufficient stability. To preserve the subtalar joint, an anterior double plate system for rigid fixation of isolated tibiotalar arthrodesis was developed. This is a preliminary report on the clinical and radiological outcome with this technique. Materials and Methods: Twenty-nine patients (15 men, 14 women; one ankle per patient) were treated from October 2006 to September 2007. We converted 16 ankles with osteoarthritis and difficult bone conditions., four non-united ankle arthrodeses, and nine failed total ankle replacements to an isolated tibiotalar arthrodesis using anterior double plating. If necessary, we used solid allograft to fill bony defects. Outcomes included bone union as assessed by radiographs, pain as indicated by the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society scores, and patient satisfaction. Results: Solid arthrodesis was achieved after an average of 12.3 (eight to 26) weeks in the 16 ankles without bone graft interposed between the tibia and talus, and 14.3 (range, 8 to 26) weeks in the 13 ankles with interpositional bone allograft. Radiographs showed that the position of arthrodesis obtained at the time of surgery did not change in any patient up to one year after surgery. The mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Hindfoot Score increased from 37 (range, 20 to 63) preoperatively to 68 (range, 50 to 92) at the last followup. Twenty-seven patients (93%) were satisfied with their outcome and indicated they would have the operation again. No complications were noted. Conclusion: The anterior double plating system was shown be a reliable method to achieve solid isolated tibiotalar arthrodesis, even in ankles with difficult conditions such as loss of bone stock due to failed total ankle arthroplasty.

Treatment options are limited and outcomes are controversial in nonunion. Classical reconstruction methods are challenging. We describe a method of internal bone transport for treatment of complicated nonunion of the forearm. This method permits axial and internal bone transport without harming the distorted and complex neurovascular anatomy or soft-tissue envelope. Materials and Methods: Five patients (mean age, 27 years) with defect nonunion (3 ulna, 2 radius) were treated. Mean preoperative defect size was 36 mm, mean shortening was 14 (0u30) mm, and the extent of surgical resection was 24 (20u40) mm. Total bone loss due to defect, resection, or shortening was 74 mm. According to Paley classification, two of the patients had B1, and three had B3 defect nonunion. This study treats defect nonunion of the forearm using an internal bone-transport method. Our method involved cannulated screws, a cerclage wire, and a circular fixator being used in combination. When transportation was completed, internal fixation of the docking site with a plate and screws was done, with bone grafting after fixator removal. Bone healing and functional outcomes were assessed with radiographs and disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) scores, respectively. Results: Mean followup was 67.6 months. Solid osseous union and functional improvement were achieved in all cases. Mean bone loss was 66 mm, mean fixator time was 131.8 days, the lengthening index was 1.3 days/mm, and the fixator index was 2.1 days/mm. DASH score was 82.2 before treatment and 15.36 after treatment. Conclusions: Using our method, internal bone transport and progressive axial docking of defects can be done with minimal effects on surrounding neurovascular arrangements and soft tissues. Size of fixators can be decreased and formation of painful scar tissue can be avoided.

A Retrospective Cohort Study	GERIATRIC ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY & REHABILITATION			English	Article						distal radial fracture; distal ulnar fracture; metaphyseal fracture; internal fixation; elderly patient	PLATE FIXATION; MANAGEMENT; REDUCTION	Introduction: Distal metaphyseal ulnar fractures are often found in conjunction with distal radius fractures. However, there is no consensus on optimal management. The purpose of this study was to determine whether simultaneous fixation of both distal radius and distal ulnar fractures would improve outcomes. Materials and Methods: Patients treated for distal radial fractures over a 4-year period at our trauma center were identified, and their medical records were analyzed. Twenty-three patients met the inclusion criteria for this study. All radius fractures were fixed using a volar locking plate. Fourteen ulnar fractures were treated with surgical fixation, and nine were treated conservatively. Data were collected on patient demographics, mechanism of injury, whether it was a closed or open fracture, Gustilo classification, AO/OTA classification, immobilization period, follow-up period, and type of treatment. Physical findings comprising the active range of motion and grip strength and radiological findings, including the ulnar variance compared to the healthy side and bone union, were evaluated. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores. Results: There was no significant difference between the groups in the quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores, but the arc of dorsi-palmar flexion was more restricted in the operative group than in the conservative group. Other results were not significantly different between the two groups. Discussion: Fixation of distal metaphyseal ulnar fractures can be challenging, and several studies have shown the validity of conservative treatments. This supports the view that if the distal radius fracture is anatomically and rigidly fixed, distal metaphyseal ulnar fractures can be successfully managed conservatively. Conclusion: Our results did not show any merit in the simultaneous fixation of both distal radius and distal ulnar fractures. Thus, needless surgery should be avoided.

Open reduction and internal fixation with locking plates can be considered as gold-standard technique but has a high rate of post-operative complications. Min-imally invasive calcaneoplasty combined with minimally invasive screw osteosynthesis is largely drawn from the management of depressed lumbar or tibial plateau fractures. The hypothesis of this study is that calcaneoplasty associated with minimally invasive percutaneous screw osteosynthesis presents biome-chanical characteristics comparable with conventional osteosynthesis. Materials and methods: Eight hind feet were collected. A SANDERS 2B fracture was reproduced on each specimen, while four calcanei were reduced by a balloon calcaneoplasty method and fixed with a lateral screw, four others were manually reduced and fixed with conventional osteosynthesis. Each calcaneus was then segmented for 3D finite element modeling. A vertical load was applied to the joint surface in order to measure the displacement fields and the stress distribution according to the type of osteosyn-thesis. Results: Analyses of the intra-articular displacement fields showed lower overall displacements in cal-caneal joints treated with calcaneoplasty and lateral screw fixation. Better stress distribution was found in the calcaneoplasty group with lower equivalent joint stresses. These results could be explained by the role of the PMMA cement as a strut, enabling better load transfer. Conclusion: Balloon Calcaneoplasty combined with lateral screw osteosynthesis has biomechanical char-acteristics at least comparable to locking plate fixation in the treatment of SANDERS 2B calcaneal joint fractures in terms of displacement fields and stress distribution under the premise of anatomical reduc-tion.

Recently, the femoral neck system (FNS) was introduced, and was promoted on the basis of less invasiveness, shorter operating time, and less fluoroscopy time compared to previous systems. The aim of this study was to compare two systems for the internal fixation of femoral neck fractures (FNF), namely the dynamic hip screw (DHS) with an anti-rotation screw (ARS) and an FNS. The outcome measures included operating room time (ORT), dose-area product (DAP), length of stay (LOS), perioperative changes in haemoglobin concentrations, and transfusion rate. Materials and Methods: A retrospective single-centre study was conducted. Patients treated for FNF between 1 January 2020 and 30 September 2021 were included, provided that they had undergone closed reduction and internal fixation. We measured the centrum-collum-diaphyseal (CCD) and the Pauwels angle preoperatively and one week postoperatively. Results: In total, 31 patients (16 females), with a mean age of 62.81 +/- 15.05 years, were included. Fracture complexity assessed by the Pauwels and Garden classification did not differ between groups preoperatively. Nonetheless, the ORT (54 +/- 26.1 min vs. 91.68 +/- 23.96 min, p < 0.01) and DAP (721 +/- 270.6 cGycm(2) vs. 1604 +/- 1178 cGycm(2), p = 0.03) were significantly lower in the FNS group. The pre- and postoperative CCD and Pauwels angles did not differ statistically between groups. Perioperative haemoglobin concentration changes (-1.77 +/- 1.19 g/dl vs. -1.74 +/- 1.37 g/dl) and LOS (8 +/- 5.27 days vs. 7.35 +/- 3.43 days) were not statistically different. Conclusions: In this cohort, the ORT and DAP were almost halved in the patient group treated with FNS. This may confer a reduction in secondary risks related to surgery.

Models of atrophic nonunions are usually achieved by providing a highly stable biomechanical environment. For this purpose, external fixators have been investigated, but plate osteosynthesis, despite its high clinical relevance, has not yet been considered in mice. We hereby proposed and investigated the use of an internal osteosynthesis for stabilizing large bone defects. To this aim, a 3.5-mm-long segmental bone defect was induced in the mid-shaft of the femur using a Gigli saw and a jig. Bone fixation was performed using a titanium microlocking plate with four locking screws. The bone defect was either left empty or filled with a syngenic bone graft or filled with a coralline scaffold. Healing was monitored using radiographs. The healing process was further assessed using microcomputed tomography and histology 10 weeks after surgery. With the exception of one mouse that died during the surgical procedure, no complications were observed. A stable and reproducible bone fixation as well as a reproducible fixation of the implanted materials with full weight bearing was obtained in all animals tested. Nonunion was consistently observed in the group in which the defects were left empty. Bone union was obtained with the syngenic bone grafts, providing evidence that, although such defects were of critical size, bone healing was possible when the gold-standard material was used to fill the defect. Although new bone formation was greater in the coralline scaffold group than in the left-empty animal group, it remained limited and localized close to the bony edges, a consequence of the critical size of such bone defect. Our study established a reproducible, clinically relevant, femoral, atrophic nonunion, critical-sized defect, low morbidity mouse model. The present study was successful in designing and testing in a small animal model, a novel surgical method for the assessment of bone repair; this model has the potential to facilitate investigations of the molecular and cellular events involved in bone regeneration in load-bearing, segmental-bone defects.

Extensively coated revision stems in proximally deficient femur: Early results in 15 patients	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Cementless fixation; extensively coated; proximally deficient femur	TOTAL HIP-ARTHROPLASTY; FOLLOW-UP; FEMORAL COMPONENT; CEMENTING TECHNIQUES; SURVIVORSHIP; REPLACEMENT	Background: Hip replacement following failed internal fixation (dynamic hip screw for intertrochanteric fractures) or previous hip arthroplasty presents a major surgical challenge. Proximal fitting revision stems do not achieve adequate fixation. Distal fixation with long-stemmed extensively coated cementless implants (like the Solution[TM] system) affords a suitable solution. We present our early results of 15 patients treated with extensively coated cementless revision stems. Materials and Methods: Fifteen patients with severely compromised proximal femora following either failed hip arthroplasty or failed internal fixation (dynamic hip screw fixation for intertrochanteric fractures) were operated by the senior author over a two-year period. Eight patients had aseptic loosening of their femoral stems following cemented hip replacements, with severe thinning of their proximal cortices and impending stress fractures. Seven had secondary hip arthritis following failure of long implants for comminuted intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric femoral fractures. All patients were treated by removal of implant (cemented stems/DHS implants) and insertion of long-stemmed extensively coated cementless revision ( Solution[TM]; DePuy, Warsaw (IN), US ) stems along with press-fit acetabular component (Duraloc Cup, DePuy, Warsaw (IN), US). All eight hip revisions needed extended trochanteric osteotomies. Results: All patients were primarily kept in bed on physiotherapy for six weeks and then gradually progressed to weight-bearing walking over the next six to eight weeks. The Harris Hip Scores and patient satisfaction were used for final evaluation. We achieved good results in the short term studied. In our first three patients (all following failed cemented total hip replacements), we resorted to cerclage wiring to hold osteotomised segments (done to facilitate stem removal). The subsequent 12 proceeded without the need for cerclage wiring. One patient had a intraoperative severe comminuted fracture extending into the supracondylar region while hammering in the stem. Post cerclage wiring, she was put on a long knee brace and her mobilization was delayed to 12 weeks. Conclusions: The extensively coated cementless ( Solution[TM] ) femoral stem provides a reasonable solution to the deficient femur in hip revision. The proximal femoral deficiences can be relatively easily bypassed and distal fixation can be achieved with this stem. Extreme care needs to be taken to avoid fractures and penetration of the femoral shaft, which can, however, be managed by cerclage wiring. Principles of a successful outcome include preservation of the functional continuity of the abduction apparatus, care to recognize and prevent distal extension of fracture while inserting the stem (preemptive cerclage wiring) and supervised rehabilitation.

Technical difficulties in hardware removal in titanium compression plates with locking screws	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Locking compression plate; LCP; Internal fixation devices; Hardware removal; Traumatology		With the advent of locking screws fixation devices, came new problems when removing internal fixation hardware. The objective of this study was to evaluate these problems and their possible solutions. The first problem was screws jamming on the plate, secondary to either initial poor screwing technique (with inadequate placement of the targeting device) or use of excessive force (when screwing in the screws without using the torque-controlling screwdriver). Treatment consists of destroying the screw heads using tungsten drills. The screw bodies can then be extracted using a trephine drill. The second problem involves destruction of the recess of the screw head. It can be secondary to overly forceful screw insertion or risky screw extraction. This can be treated using a specific conical left-turn screwdriver, assuming that the screw/plate thread is still intact. Finally, the screw recess can be filled. The plate itself may be a source of problems when being extracted because the screw holes left free also have been filled. Lever arm maneuvers to raise the fibrous bridges and substantial traction along the axis can be useful. These problems are more frequent with minimally invasive surgery. The consequences of this fixation type's hardware removal surgery are multiple: lengthened operative time, risk of secondary maximally invasive surgery, presence of metallic shavings residues in cases of screw head destruction, and the risk of iterative fracture secondary to trephine drill use. Prevention is thus essential. It is based on rigorous technique in placing the targeting device, drilling, and inserting screws, the systematic use of the torque-controlling screwdriver, and the verification of proper screw position. The locking compression plate (LCP) material is highly effective but its removal should not become challenging. Level of evidence: Level V. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Internal fixation by stiff bone-plate is one of the standard methods to achieve these objectives. Recently, there is considerable interest in the usage of compliant plates to enhance bone healing with reduced stress shielding. Herein, first an analytical solution is developed to determine screw forces in the bone-plate assembly that conforms the plate and the bone under bending load. Based on the analytical calculations, an optimal fixator plate selection criterion for necessary and sufficient stress shielding is proposed. Second, effectiveness of employing a non-homogeneous stiffness graded (SG) plate rather than a homogeneous stainless steel (SS) plate for stress shielding is investigated using a finite element method. It is found that stress shielding on bone by SG plate is less compared to SS plate.

J	Bo, XF; Wang, WD; Chen, Z; Liu, ZC				Bo, Xuefeng; Wang, Weida; Chen, Zan; Liu, Zhicheng			RESEARCH ON THE STRATEGY OF REDUCTION OPERATION OF BASILAR INVAGINATION COMBINED WITH ATLANTOAXIAL DISLOCATION	JOURNAL OF MECHANICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Basilar invagination; atlantoaxial dislocation; compression distraction reduction technique; surgical optimization	CERVICAL-SPINE	Background: The complicated basilar invagination and atlantoaxial dislocation (BI-AAD) can cause a variety of neurological symptoms. Active treatment should be given. The main method of surgical treatment is to relieve the compression of the ventral bone of the brain stem and to fix the unstable spinal segments for fusion. At present, more surgical methods choose modified posterior cervical reduction and internal fixation fusion. Objective: The clinician has preliminarily designed an internal occipital fixation system capable of restoring both horizontal and vertical AADs, and proposed a new compression and distraction reduction (CDR) technique. The feasibility and effectiveness of posterior AAD reduction surgery using CDR techniques for different types of patients were studied in this paper. Methods: First, according to the CT scan sequence images of the congenital BI-AAD patient's cervical vertebra, the software Materialize Mimics 13.1 was imported to reconstruct 3D geometric model of cervical spine (C0-C7). Then the geometric topology model was carried out in Geomagic2012 software, and surrounding soft tissue was established using SpaceClaim 14.0. The 3D finite element model (FEM) of cervical vertebra for congenital BI-AAD patients was obtained by assigning material attributes, setting contacts and mesh in ANSYS 14.0. To simulate the physiological activities of the spine under two conditions of forward flexion and backward extension, preoperative verification was carried out with the maximum displacement parameter. According to the postoperative CT data of the patient, the position and degree of freedom (DOF) of the occipitocervical internal fixation system were determined. The FEM of the occipitocervical internal fixation system was established by dividing unit grid in ANSYS. Using multiple loading step of statics analysis method, the CDR technology of posterior AAD reduction surgery was simulated. When the atlantoaxial horizontal and vertical reductions were satisfactory, the displacement data were obtained and verified using the post-operative data. Results: The cervical spine (C0-C7) FEM of congenital BI-AAD patients was established. For some lateral atlantoaxial articulation abnormal ossification II, we simulated the CDR technique for the AAD reduction surgery and proposed using the vertical traction instead of vertical reduction. Conclusion: This study confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of posterior AAD reduction surgery using CDR techniques and proposes the different reduction optimization scheme for the patients with lateral atlantoaxial articulation abnormal ossification II of congenital BI-AAD. The results of this study provide a biomechanical theoretical basis for improving the reliability of simple posterior reduction surgery and optimizing the surgical treatment of BI-AAD.

The complexity of injury, lack of muscle cover and poor vascularity make these fractures difficult to treat. Surgical treatment of distal tibial fractures includes several options: external fixation, IM nailing, ORIF and minimally-invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO). Management of distal tibial fractures with MIPO enables preservation of soft tissue and remaining blood supply. This is a report of a series of prospectively studied closed distal tibial and pilon fractures treated with MIPO. Materials and methods: A total of 21 patients with closed distal tibial or pilon fractures were enrolled in the study between March 2008 and November 2013 and completed follow-up. Demographic characteristics, mechanism of injury, time required for union, ankle range of motion and complications were recorded. Fractures were classified according to the AO/OTA classification. Nineteen patients were initially managed with an ankle-spanning external fixator. When the status of the soft tissue had improved and swelling had subsided enough, a definitive internal fixation with MIPO was performed. Patients were invited for follow-up examinations at 3 and 6 weeks and then at intervals of 6 to 8 weeks until 12 months. Results: Mean age of the patients was 40.1 years (range 19-67 years). Eighteen cases were the result of high-energy trauma and three were the result of low-energy trauma. According to the AO/OTA classification there were extraarticular and intraarticular fractures, but only simple articular patterns without depression or comminution. The average time for fracture union was 19.7 weeks (range 12-38 weeks). Mean range of motion was 108 of dorsiflexion (range 5-158) and 28.38 of plantar flexion (range 20-358). Three cases were metalwork-related complications. Two patients underwent plate removal at 24 weeks because of plate impingement. There was one case of wound breakdown at 11 weeks. One patient had fracture union with tibial recurvatum of approximately 108, without functional impairment. Two patients had delayed union. Conclusion: MIPO is a reliable method of treatment for distal tibial fractures; it provides a high union rate and good functional outcome with minimal soft tissue complications. Skin impingement remains a common complication with MIPO, but this can be solved by timely plate removal. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This ligament is located in the stifle joint and contributes to its stabilization during excessive forward movement and internal rotation of the tibia. One method for the surgical treatment of cranial ligament rupture is the placement of an extracapsular suture. Different materials and methods of suture fixation have been used in dogs and cats. This study investigated the use of a novel polylactide absorbable bone anchor that was implanted with ultrasound technology for suture fixation and compared this with suture fixation alone and fixation with a nonabsorbable bone anchor using an ex vivo modified limb-press model. For evaluation, distance measurements on radiographs were performed and the angles between defined bony structures were calculated. The acquired measurements accounted for both craniocaudal and mediolateral movements, and the results showed that the absorbable anchor could neutralize excessive movement within the stifle joint in two of three measurements and seems to be a good alternative to well-known surgical methods. Background: This study evaluated joint stability after surgical repair of cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL)-deficient stifle joints in cats using a novel absorbable polylactide bone anchor in an ex vivo model. Methods: Thirty-six hindlimbs from cats with intact (G(i) group) and transected CrCLs were treated with fabellotibial suture alone (G(FW) group), suture combined with an absorbable polylactide bone anchor (G(WD) group), or suture combined with a nonabsorbable bone anchor (G(FT) group), positioned in a limb press with predefined joint angles (stifle joint: 120 +/- 5 degrees; hock joint: 120 +/- 5 degrees) and loaded with 10%, 20%, and 30% of body mass (BM). Predefined points were measured on lateral radiographs and with a coordinate measurement machine. Distances on radiographs (mm) were measured and angles (degrees) were calculated to represent the craniocaudal movement and the internal rotation of the tibia. Results: There were no differences for craniocaudal movement between G(i) and G(FW) or G(FT), but for G(WD) regarding angle measurement at 30% BM. For internal rotation, there was no significant difference between G(i) and G(FW) or G(WD), but for G(FT). Conclusion: The used absorbable polylactide bone-anchor was able to stabilize the stifle joint regarding internal rotation and craniocaudal movement as calculated from distance measurements.

Samples with increasing beta-TCP (0-60% w/w) contents were processed by injection molding. The in vitro study consisted of an evaluation of inflammatory potential by assaying the IL-1 alpha secreted by monocytes, and then cell proliferation (counting) and phenotype expression (PAL and I collagen) in human osteogenous cells. The in vivo study was carried out using cylindrical implants of composite materials composed of composite materials containing 0 or 60% beta-TCP and pure P-TCP, respectively. The implants were inserted in femoral sites in rabbits, using the Kathagen protocol. Each animal received a 60% implant, with either a 0 or a 100% implant in the contralateral femur, so that the materials could be compared with one another. Five animals were examined for each material and implantation period, giving a total of 30 animals. This study showed that adding increasing percentages of beta-TCP to a lactic acid polymer matrix stimulated the proliferation of human osteogenous cells and synthesis of the extracellular bone matrix in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo results indicate that, in comparison with pure PLA, tricalcium phosphate-containing composite materials had faster degradation kinetics, caused less inflammatory reaction, and promoted contact osteogenesis. The composite material containing 60% beta-TCP demonstrated a similar performance to pure tricalcium phosphate bone grafts in terms of osteogenesis, and is apparently compatible with the production of intra-osseous implants for situations representing high levels of mechanical strain.

J	Meng, XZ; Xu, JX				Meng, Xian-zhong; Xu, Jia-xin			The options of C2 fixation for os odontoideum: a radiographic study for the C2 pedicle and lamina anatomy	EUROPEAN SPINE JOURNAL			English	Article						Os odontoideum pedicle screw; Laminar screw; C2 fixation	TRANSARTICULAR SCREW FIXATION; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; ATLANTOAXIAL DISLOCATION; INTERNAL-FIXATION; CLINICAL ARTICLE; VERTEBRAL ARTERY; PLACEMENT; FUSION; SUITABILITY; CONSTRUCTS	Introduction Patients with os odontoideum always present instability in atlantoaxial joint and need atlantoaxial fixation. C2 pedicle or laminar screws fixation has proven to be efficient and reliable for atlantoaxial instability. However, os odontoideum is a congenital or developmental disease, featured with anomalous bony anatomies. The anatomic measurements and guidelines for C2 pedicle screw placement in general population tends to differ with those of os odontoideum patients, for whom C2 pedicle screws are often needed. The option and techniques of C2 fixation are still challenging and yet to be fully explored. Material and methods We recruited 29 adult patients with os odontoideum and measured the dimension of C2 pedicle and lamina for each patient to examine how well do they match with the screws anatomically. In order to access the intra-observer reliability and inter-observer repeatability of the measurements, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was also calculated. Results The results for reliability of the CT measurements showed excellent intraobserver (ICC = 0.95 and 0.96) and interobserver correlation coefficient (ICC = 0.93). The diameter and length of C2 pedicle were found to be 6.06 +/- A 1.37 and 24.05 +/- A 2.54 mm, while the corresponding figures of C2 laminar were 6.95 +/- A 0.82 and 25.60 +/- A 2.18 mm, respectively. In the measurements, all 29 cases had suitable diameter (larger than 5.5 mm) for C2 laminar screw (the laminar diameters ranged from 5.52 to 8.82 mm). In C2 pedicle measurements, the diameters of the 29 cases were from 3.50 to 9.86 mm, while 20 pedicles (34.5%) in 14 cases were less than 5.5 mm in diameter. Six had bilateral small pedicles where the diameter was less than 5.5 mm. Conclusion Anatomically, we found laminar screw is a better match in comparison with pedicle screw for C2 fixation in os odontoideum. The options for C2 fixation should be made based on careful preoperative imaging and thorough consideration. Preoperative reconstructive CT scan can offer great assistance for the choice of fixation in os odontoideum by revealing the anatomy of the C2 pedicles in detail.

Three-dimensional design optimisation of patient-specific femoral plates as a means of bone remodelling reduction	COMPUTER METHODS IN BIOMECHANICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						optimisation; internal plate; femur; strain energy density; bone remodelling	SHAPE OPTIMIZATION; STRESS PROTECTION; INTERNAL-FIXATION; LOADING HISTORY; HIP-PROSTHESIS; STIFFNESS; DENSITY; FRACTURES; STRENGTH; BIOLOGY	Previous investigations into the optimisation of internal plates have mostly focused on the material properties of the implant. In this work, we optimise the shape, size and placement of the plate for successfully minimising bone remodelling around the implant. A design optimisation algorithm based on strain energy density criterion, combined with the finite element analysis, has been used in this study. The main optimisation goal was to reduce this change and keep it close to the conditions of an intact femur. The results suggest that the anterolateral side of the bone would be the optimum location for the plate, as for the geometry, the optimum moves towards having a thick, wide and short plate. These important results could be directly applicable to orthopaedic surgeons treating a femur fracture with internal plates. Since the optimisation algorithm remains the same for any patient, this advancement provides the surgeon with a tool to minimise the post surgery remodelling by trying to maintain the natural structure of the bone.

Those issue are mainly related to knee and hip arthroplasty, and they could be responsible for implant failure. To reduce mismatching-related adverse events between bone and prosthesis mechanical properties, modifying the implant's internal geometry varying the bulk stiffness and density could be the right approach. Therefore, this feasibility study aims to assess which in-body gap geometry improves, by reducing, the bulk stiffness. Methods: Using five finite element models, a uniaxial compression test in five cubes with a 20 mm thickness was simulated and analyzed. The displacements, strain and Young Modulus were calculated in four cubes, each containing internal prismatic gaps with different transversal sections (squared, hexagonal, octagonal, and circular). Those were compared with a fifth full-volume cube used as control. Results: The most significant difference have been achieved in displacement values, in cubes containing internal gaps with hexagonal and circular transversal sections (82 mu m and 82.5 mu m, respectively), when compared to the full-volume cube (69.3 mu m). Conclusions: This study suggests that hexagonal and circular shape of the gaps allows obtaining the lower rigidity in a size range of 4 mm, offering a starting approach to achieve a "close-to-bone" material, with a potential use in prosthetic devices with limited thickness.

Furthermore the role of a modified screw placement with addressing the infra-acetabular corridor and the use of locking screws were evaluated. Materials and methods: Custom made anterior column fractures in artificial SYNBONE pelves were fixed with different acetabular plates (group I: MPS, group II: LPPS none locking and group III: LPPS locking). Each pelvis was tested twice, with the additionally placed infra-acetabular lag screw [+] first, followed by a repeated measurement without the infra-acetabular screw [-]. Six pelves per group were tested under static loading with six cycles up to 800 N, each. The fracture displacement was measured in the weight bearing dome using an ultrasound based Zebris-3D-Motion Analyzer. Results: The MPS-plate had a less fixation strength compared to the LPPS-plate (mean +/- SD of maximum fracture displacement [mm] in group I vs. group II = 0.63 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.37 +/- 0.02, p < 0.05). The locking feature did not increase the fracture fixation strength (mean +/- SD of maximum fracture displacement [mm] in group II vs. group III: 0.37 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.37 +/- 0.03; ns). The infra-acetabular screw significantly reduces the maximum fracture displacement in all groups, independent of the plate systems ([Delta%] in group I = 50; group II = 63 and group III = 40; p < 0.05 each). Conclusion: The LPPS-plate performed superior fixation strength for anterior column fractures compared to the MPS-plate. The locking plate modality did not reduce the maximum fracture displacement, whereas the additional infra-acetabular screw placement actually doubles the fracture fixation strength independent of the used plate system.

Objective: To study the results of direct repair of type 2 hangman fracture using Iso-C3D navigation. Summary of Background: Direct fixation of axis pedicle fracture gives biomechanically stronger stability and early mobilization. These fixations are technically demanding. Very few cases of direct fixation using Iso-C3D navigation are reported. We report the largest series of directly fixed hangman fractures so far. Materials and Methods: Twenty type 2 hangman fractures (18 men and 2 women), in age group of 17 63 years (average, 38 y), were treated by posterior direct repair using Judet screws under Iso-C3D navigation. Twelve had road traffic accident, 7 had fallen from height, and 1 had direct injury to head. Nine had limb or pelvic fractures. Eighteen patients had normal, 2 had ASIA D, and 1 had ASIA B neurology. Results: With no intraoperative complications, 18 patients underwent bilateral pedicle fixation and 2 underwent unilateral fixation, with an average blood loss of 220 mL. Average follow-up was 29 months. Postoperative images showed good reduction with union in an average of 8 weeks. Average anterior translation of 3.2 mm preoperatively was reduced to 1.0 mm postoperatively. Computed tomography axial cuts distance with an average of 3.57 mm on right side and 3.66 mm on left side were reduced to 0.40 and 0.46 mm postoperatively. Two cases presenting with pseudoarthrosis showed consolidation after 25 weeks of surgery. Visual analog score of 7 preoperatively reduced to 1 by 8 weeks, 0 by 20 weeks postoperatively, except in 2 patients. In one patient, screws were removed after 8 months postoperatively and in other patient pain subsided gradually by 7 months. According to Myung-Sang Moon Assessment Criteria, 14 had excellent, 3 had good, 2 had fair, and 1 had poor results. P value was significant for visual analog score and postoperative reduction distance. Conclusions: Use of Iso-C navigation allows safe direct fixation of hangman fractures.

Objective: To assess the effect of bilateral C1 laminar hooks combined with C2 pedicle screw fixation for the treatment of C1-C2 instability. Summary of Background Data: Various posterior atlantoaxial fixations for C1-C2 instability have been developed. However, due to anatomic anomalies of the vertebral artery, the smallness of the pedicle, trajectories of broken screws, or a lack of surgical experience, a simple atlantoaxial fixation technique with good safety and effectiveness is urgently needed. Materials and Methods: From January 2007 to September 2012, 18 patients with C1-C2 instability who underwent posterior bilateral C1 laminar hooks combined with C2 pedicle screw fixation were evaluated. Six patients had acute odontoid fractures (Anderson IIc type), 8 patients had odontoid pseudarthrosis, 3 had os odontoideum, and 1 had a traumatic rupture of the transverse ligament. The mean age at the time of surgery was 34.1 years. The clinical and radiographic analyses were performed before and after the operation and at follow-up. Results: The follow-up period was 12-78 months (with an average follow-up period of 25.6 mo). All patients were relieved of pain and their neurological symptoms were substantially improved. The postoperative JOA score improved significantly (t = -7.234, P< 0.001). No neurological or vascular complications occurred in these cases. The device was placed well and had not loosened or broken and plain radiographs revealed bony fusion in 17 patients. One patient had C1 posterior arch fracture 3 weeks postoperatively and she was followed up for 18 months without revision surgery. Conclusions: When appropriate patients were selected, bilateral C1 laminar hooks combined with C2 pedicle screw fixation can be an alternative method to treat C1-C2 instability effectively with a relatively simple procedure. Preoperative planning and evaluation were crucial for the solid atlantoaxial fusion.

The aim of study was compare the stability of two different plate fixation of a tibia pilon AO-43C1 type fractures. Material and methods: In this study, three-dimensional finite element stress analysis was applied using isotropic materials and static linear analysis. Loading of 400 N force was applied to the model of a patient fixed in a standing position. In the model, first the fibula was treated by plating and then in one group the pilon fracture was treated by medial plating, and in the other by anterolateral plating. The displacement and stress values of the fragments of the fracture line were compared of the same points in each model. Results: The magnitude of the displacement of fragments in the total displacement magnitudes of X, Y, Z axis were measured in the medial plate and anterolateral plate. The anterolateral plate results were similar to those of the medial plate and the displacement values in the Y axis were determined to be lower than in the medial plate. Conclusion: In AO 43 Cl distal tibia fractures, medial or anterolateral plates can be used, and the results of this study showed similar biomechanical stiffness in the two plates.

Most fixation agents such as aldehydes, as well as embedding resins, do not allow subsequent use of fluorescent staining and make material too soft to make good-quality hand-sections. Moreover, cutting thin roots can be very difficult and time consuming. A new, fast and effective method to provide good-quality sections and fluorescent staining of fresh or fixed root samples, including those of very thin roots (such as Arabidopsis or Noccaea), is described here. To overcome the above-mentioned difficulties the following procedure is proposed: fixation in methanol (when fresh material cannot be used) followed by en bloc staining with toluidine blue, embedding in 6 agarose, preparation of free-hand sections of embedded material, staining with fluorescent dye, and observation in a microscope under UV light. Despite eventual slight deformation of primary cell walls (depending on the species and root developmental stage), this method allows effective observation of different structures such as ontogenetic changes of cells along the root axis, e.g. development of xylem elements, deposition of Casparian bands and suberin lamellae in endodermis or exodermis or peri-endodermal thickenings in Noccaea roots. This method provides good-quality sections and allows relatively rapid detection of cell-wall modifications. Also important is the possibility of using this method for free-hand cutting of extremely thin roots such as those of Arabidopsis.

Materials and Methods: Between 2004 and 2006, 43 patients who sustained closed fractures of the distal tibia metaphysis were managed with either a stainless steel nonlocking plate (Group 1, n = 21) or a titanium locking plate (Group 2, n = 22). Clinical and radiographic data were retrospectively reviewed. Function was assessed with use of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot instrument. The average followup period was 25 months. Results: The average AOFAS foot and ankle scores in Group 1 and Group 2 at final followup were 85 and 81, respectively. Fracture reduction was anatomical or nearly anatomical without angular displacement in all cases except one patient in Group 2. (p > 0.05) The average time to full, unprotected weightbearing in Group 1 and Group 2 were 15 weeks and 18 weeks, respectively (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Minimally invasive medial plating with titanium locking plates resulted in prolonged secondary healing both in comminuted and simple fracture patterns compared to conventional stainless steel nonlocking plates. We believe that in biological fixation of distal tibial fractures, similarly good results may be obtained with both materials as the locking technology had a greater effect on stability.

In this study, we used finite element analysis to simulate peak von Mises stress (PVMS) and deformation of bone plates and screws with the following four materials-Ti, Mg alloy, PLLA, and HA-PLLA-at a unilateral mandibular fracture. A three-dimensional virtual mandibular model was constructed, and the fracture surface was designed to run from the left mandibular angle. Masticatory loading was applied on the right first molars. Stress was concentrated at the upper part and the neck of the screw. The largest PVMS was observed for Ti; that was followed by Mg alloy, HA-PLLA, and PLLA. The largest deformation was observed for PLLA; next was HA-PLLA, then Mg alloy, and finally Ti. We could rank relative superiority in terms of mechanical properties. The HA-PLLA screw and mini-plate deformed less than 0.15 mm until 300 N. Thus, we can expect good bone healing with usual masticatory loading six weeks postoperatively. HA-PLLA is more frequently indicated clinically than PLLA owing to less deformation. If the quality of HA-PLLA fixation is improved, it could be widely utilized in facial bone trauma or craniofacial surgery.

However, the bone plates have high elastic modulus and do not match the biomechanics of human bone, which adversely affects callus formation and fracture healing. Moreover, the complex microenvironment in the human body can induce corrosion of metallic materials and release toxic ions, which reduces the biocompatibility of the bone plate, and may necessitate surgical removal of the implant. In this study, tantalum (Ta) was deposited on porous silicon carbide (SiC) scaffolds by chemical vapor deposition technology to prepare a novel porous tantalum (pTa) trabecular bone metal plate. The function of the novel bone plate was evaluated by implantation in an animal fracture model. The results showed that the novel bone plate was effective in fracture fixation, without breakage. Both X-ray and microcomputed tomography analysis showed indirect healing by both pTa trabecular bone metal plates and titanium (Ti) plates; however, elastic fixation and obvious callus formation were observed after fixation with pTa trabecular bone metal plates, indicating better bone repair. Histology showed that pTa promoted the formation of new bone and integrated well with the host bone. Therefore, this novel pTa trabecular bone metal plate has good prospects for application in treating fractures.

Objectives: The authors report a continuous and prospective series of type C periprosthetic femoral fractures to assess the mechanical stability of the femoral implant and the clinical outcome at the medium term. Material and methods: Between April 2004 and November 2006, we treated 17 patients (15 females, two males) presenting a prosthetic hip fracture (12 cases), between the hip prosthesis and the knee (one case), and with a knee prosthesis (four cases). All the implants had no sign of loosening at the time of fracture. The patients' mean age was 76.7 years (range, 39-93 years). Internal fixation was obtained with a locking compression plate (LCP) Synthes (TM) bridging the implant in place to prevent a weak zone. The rehabilitation protocol consisted in full weightbearing as much as possible. Results: The mean follow-up of the series was 31.5 months (range, 4-51 months). Four deaths were recorded during the follow-up. Minimally invasive surgery was performed in 15 patients. Total loading was possible immediately in 10 patients, partial loading at 20 kg in three patients, and no loading was possible until 6 weeks in four patients. Two infections and a bending-type mechanical complication of the plate secondary to a fall were observed. Consolidation was obtained in all cases with the appearance of callus formation beginning in the 6th week. Discussion: The technique used allies the principle of closed internal fixation (with preservation of the fracture hematoma) with mechanical stability. The screws locking to the plate warrant an internal fixator with increased stability that is sufficient for early loading with no risk of losing the secondary axis. Despite this increased rigidity, we did not observe any particular stress on the femoral implants. We recommend bridging the implant and spaced locking for better distribution of the stresses during loading. This hardware, with, if possible, insertion using a reduced approach, seems adapted to periprosthetic femoral fractures, particularly in the elderly. Level of evidence: Level IV, prospective therapeutic study. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Material/Methods: From August 2000 to October 2011, a total of 48 patients with complex acetabular fracture were enrolled in this study. Average operative time, intraoperative blood loss volume, blood transfusion volume, satisfactory reduction, and postoperative functional recovery rate were recorded and compared between the 2 groups. Results: A significant difference was observed between the 2 groups in operative time (P=0.003). For intraoperative blood loss and blood transfusion, ORIF combined with temporary balloon occlusion of abdominal aorta techniques appeared to be superior to normal ORIF (blood loss: P=0.007; and blood transfusion: P=0.019, respectively). However, no differences were observed in postoperative blood loss or transfusion (P>0.05). Patients in group A showed better hip function than those in group B (group A: a good-to-excellent rate of 77.8%; group B: a good-to-excellent rate of 78.3%; P>0.05). With regard to the incidence of postoperative complications, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups (group A: 9/18; group B: 11/23; P=0.890). Conclusions: In the treatment of complex acetabular fracture, temporary balloon occlusion of the abdominal aorta is a reliable technique to assist ORIF surgery to staunch the flow of blood.

Primary nonunion of intertrochanteric fractures of femur: An analysis of results of valgization and bone grafting	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Bone grafting; intertrochanteric fractures; valgization	DYNAMIC HIP SCREW; TROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; VALGUS OSTEOTOMY; PROXIMAL FEMUR; SALVAGE	Background: Nonunion of intertrochanteric fractures is uncommon because there is excellent blood supply and good cancellous bone in the intertrochanteric region of the femur. A diagnosis of primary intertrochanteric nonunion is made when at least 15 weeks after the fracture there is radiological evidence of a fracture line, with either no callus (atrophic) or with callus that does not bridge the fracture site (hypertrophic). There is only one published series that exclusively describes seven primary nonunions of intertrochanteric fractures. The aim of the present study was to analyze the results of internal fixation, valgization with 135 degrees dynamic hip screw (DHS), and bone grafting in patients with primary nonunion of intertrochanteric fractures. Materials and Methods: Eighteen patients with primary intertrochanteric nonunion were included in the study; 16 were male and 2 were female. The age range was 30-70 years (mean: 46.9 years). The mean duration since index injury was 8.5 months (range: 4-18 months). As per the AO classification, the fractures were 31A 1.1 (n=1), 1.2 (n=1), 2.2 (n=3), 2.3 (n=9), and 3.3 (n=4). Three patients had hypermobile nonunion and 15 had stiff nonunion. The surgical principle was excision of pseudarthrosis, if present (n=3); freshening of the bone ends; stable fixation with 135 degrees DHS, with good proximal purchase; bone grafting; and valgization. Results: Union was achieved in all patients at an average of 5.62 months (range: 4-7 months). The Harris hip score improved from 38 points preoperatively to 86 postoperatively at healing. The average limb shortening improved by 2 cm (range: 1.5 cm-3 cm). There was no infection and pain at the hip at final follow-up in any of the cases. All patients were subjectively satisfied with the outcome. All were capable of full weight bearing on their affected limb. Conclusion: Union in primary nonunion of intertrochanteric fractures in physiologically young patients with a well-preserved femoral head and good bone stock can be achieved with internal fixation, valgization, and grafting procedures.

The new shank construct of lag screw improves the maximum compression force for internal fixations: preliminary results	EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Internal fixation; Lag screw; Shank construct	PULLOUT STRENGTH; INTERFRAGMENTARY COMPRESSION; FRACTURE FIXATION; BONE-CEMENT; TORQUE; MODEL; AUGMENTATION; PRINCIPLES; EVOLUTION; ANKLE	OBJECTIVE: The treatment of osteoporotic intra-articular fractures with AO lag screws remained challenging due to insufficient compression. Several strategies to improve the compressive ability of lag screws have been evaluated. However, the effect of the shank construct on the compressive ability of lag screw has never been explored. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of a shank construction the compressive ability of lag screw for different bone mineral densities (BMDs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three synthetic cancellous bone blocks were used for this study, including 0.12 g/cc, 0.16 g/cc, and 0.20 g/cc. 24 pilot holes with 3.2 mm diameters were drilled equably in each block. An AO lag screw and a combined lag screw with the newly designed compound shank construct were inserted through the custom-designed measuring device into a pilot hole by hand until failure, and the maximum compressive force (C-MAX) was determined. RESULTS: Among three densities specimens C-MAX of the combined lag screw was significantly higher than that of the AO lag screw (p < 0.001), and the mean C-MAX difference value of the two screws in a specimen increased as the BMD increased. The C-MAX of two screws increased as the BMD increased (p < 0.001), and the amplification of the C-MAX generated by the combined lag screw was higher than that generated by the AO lag screw when the BMD increased. CONCLUSIONS: The newly designed compound shank construct improves the compressive ability of lag screws independent of the BMD.

In order to control cellular structure in the fixation stage, we established an universal method by introducing water as an in-situ internal cooling agent during the foaming process of PP. Particularly, hydrophilic fillers were added into the high melt flow index polypropylene (HMI-PP) with poor foaming ability to study the effect of adsorbed water on the foaming process of PP/filler composites during sc-CO2 batch foaming process. Compared to pure HMI-PP, HMI-PP/hydrophilic filler composites showed increased adsorption amount for water and melt viscosity. The water within the composites played a key role in the foaming process, which not only served as a physical foaming agent to increase the volume expansion ratio of PP composite foam, but also showed the function of rapid cooling foam proved by thermal imaging technology. As a result, the presence of some hydrophilic fillers within HMI-PP matrix significantly improved the foaming properties of HMI-PP, including preventing internal bubble collapse and significantly increasing the volume expansion ratio of the foam. The applicability of this method was validated using other PP materials besides HMI-PP, including high molecular weight PP (HMW-PP), high melt strength PP (HMS-PP).

In this paper, in vivo degradation of n-HAP/PLLA and g-HAP/PLLA composite implants was investigated. The mechanical properties, molecular weight, thermal properties as well as crystallinity of the implants were measured. The bending strength of the n- and g-HAP/PLLA composites showed a marked reduction from an initial value of 102 and 114 MPa to 33 and 24 MPa at 36 weeks, respectively. While the bending strength of PLLA was maintained at 80 MPa at 36 weeks compared with initial value of 107 MPa. The impact strength increased over time especially for the composites. Significant differences in the molecular weight were seen among all the materials and g-HAP/PLLA appeared the fastest rate of decrease than others. Environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) results demonstrated that an apparently porous morphology full of pores and hollows were formed in the composites. The results indicated that the in vivo degradation of PLLA could be accelerated by the g-HAP nanoparticles. It implied that g-HAP/PLLA composites might be a candidate for human non-load bearing bone fracture fixation which needs high initial strength and fast degradation rate.

Screw Placement in Subtalar Arthrodesis: A Biomechanical Study	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Subtalar; Screw; Arthrodesis; Fusion; Talus	ANKLE ARTHRODESIS; JOINT; COMPRESSION; BONE; KINEMATICS; MOBILITY; COMPLEX	Background: Clinical outcomes of subtalar arthrodesis using screw fixation have been reported but biomechanical support for selection of screw trajectories and patterns has been lacking. This investigation was designed to assess the compressive and stabilizing abilities of different common screw insertion patterns for subtalar arthrodesis. Materials and Methods: Forty-two cadaveric subtalar joints underwent arthrodesis with a single talar neck screw, a single talar dome screw, double parallel screws, or double diverging screws. Single talar dome screw fixation was subdivided by screw tip placement in the anteromedial, posteromedial, anterolateral, or posterolateral dome. Joint compression, construct torsional stiffness, and joint angulation tinder torsional load were quantified. Results: Higher compressive force, torsional stiffness, and joint rotation resistance were achieved by double screw fixation compared to single screws (p < 0.001). Torsional stiffness with double diverging screws exceeded that of double parallel screws in internal rotation (p < 0.05). There was greater internal rotation with a single talar neck screw (p < 0.001) and greater external rotation with an anterolateral talar dome screw (p < 0.01) compared to the other single-screw orientations. Greater rotation in both directions was noted with the single screw tip located in the posterolateral talar dome (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Under the described testing conditions, double diverging screws confer the highest compression, the greatest torsional stiffness, and the least joint rotation. When a single screw is used, placement of the screw tip in the talar neck or lateral talar dome should be avoided. Clinical Relevance: The results provide an objective basis for selection of optimal screw placement by the surgeon.

A prospective, Phase IV, multicenter, randomized study. Objective. The aim of this study was to compare vertebral fusion success rates following posterolateral fusion [(PLF)/posterolateral intertransverse fusion (PITF)] surgery. The surgical procedure combined posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) and PLF with internal fixation over one or two levels using silicated calcium phosphate (SiCaP) or bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 as graft material in patients with a degenerative disorder of the lumbar spine. Summary of Background Data. Few controlled trials have evaluated the bone graft materials available to surgeons treating patients with spinal disorders, including degenerative disc disease, spondylolisthesis, and disc herniation. Methods. Following randomization, the surgical procedure consisting of PLIF and PLF with internal fixation over one or two levels was performed using SiCaP or BMP-2. No other osteoconductive/osteoinductive graft materials were permitted. Spinal fusion was assessed radiographically at <= 24 months. Clinical outcomes (pain on visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, SF-36) and adverse events (AEs) were monitored. Results. One hundred three patients were enrolled. At 12 months, fusion was achieved in 25 of 35 (71.4%) of the SiCaP and 20 of 27 (74.1%) of the BMP-2 group, respectively (P = 1.000). At 24 months, the fusion rate was 78.6% and 84.8% for SiCaP and BMP-2, respectively (P = 0.5613). Clinical outcomes improved similarly in both groups over time. AEs were consistent with this surgical population. Conclusion. SiCaP was safe and well tolerated in patients with degenerative spinal disorders requiring PLF and provided fusion rates similar to BMP-2.

In this study, a finite element analysis of the strength and superiority of modular rigid plate and rod systems, which are used in the lower lumbar region, in comparison with each other was used. MATERIAL and METHODS: A Ti6AI4V (Grade 5) titanium biocompatible alloy anterior plate was used for the lumbar spine fixation device, and a finite element analysis was conducted on the human lumbar spine model. In this study, an intact spine, a rigid system fixed with a rod, and modular plate systems were evaluated at flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation. RESULTS: They did not show statistically significant superiority over one another in terms of limitations in movement during the range of motion exercises and rigidity. CONCLUSION: The posterior rigid stabilization system and novel stabilization system do not have a significant superiority over one another. Equivalent results in the limitation of movement and rigidity allow for the use of these systems for short-segment posterior spinal instrumentation with the same indications.

Material/Method: From January 2017 to January 2022, a total of 20 cases were collected, including 6 male and 14 female patients with closed fresh distal radius fractures. All patients received volar medium approach T-shaped locking plate treatment, as well as radial auxiliary plate open reduction and internal fixation. We recorded the incidence of median nerve injury, incidence of radial artery and vein or their branches injury, postoperative X-ray measurement of radial styloid process height, ulnar declination, palmar inclination, and Gartland-Werley score. Results: All surgical procedures were successful, and all patients were monitored for 3 to 12 months after the procedure. In the postoperative follow-up, there was no obvious loss of reduction. At the last follow-up, all patients' articular surface flatness was less than 2 mm, and the mean values for palmar inclination and ulnar declination were (14.36 degrees +/- 3.55 degrees) and (19.79 degrees +/- 2.57 degrees), respectively. The average height of a radial styloid was 117 +/- 2.42 mm; functional evaluation: excellent in 12 (60%), good in 6 (30%), and fair in 2 cases (10%) cases. Five patients showed slight nerve injury, but all recovered quickly within 6 months. Conclusions: The volar median approach, which combines a T-locking plate with a radial auxiliary plate for open reduction and internal fixation, is an effective treatment for unstable distal radius fractures.

Materials and Methods: This was a prospective cohort study composed of patients treated for mandibular fractures. The primary study variable was the change between the postinjury/pretreatment IAN neurosensory examination score and the score after fracture reduction. Risk factors were categorized as demographic, anatomic, and treatment. Appropriate descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate statistics were computed. Results: The cohort was composed of 61 patients with 97 fractured sides. Forty-seven fractures (49%) were located between the lingula and mental foramen, and 50 fractures (51%) were located distal to the mental foramen. Thirty-nine fractures (41%) were displaced by 5 nun or more. Abnormal preoperative UN neurosensory examinations were documented in 81% of the fractured sides. Fifty-three fractures (54%) were treated by closed reduction and 44 (46%) by open reduction and internal fixation. In 82 fractures (85%), the IAN neurosensory score was unchanged or improved after treatment. In a multivariate model, preoperative neurosensory score, displacement, and treatment were associated with a statistically significant risk (P less than or equal to .05) for postoperative deterioration of IAN sensation. Conclusion: Open reduction and internal fixation, fracture displacement of 5 mm or more, and a normal preoperative IAN neurosensory examination were associated with an increased risk for deterioration of the UN neurosensory score after treatment of mandibular fractures. Additional studies are indicated to determine long-term IAN neurosensory function after mandibular fracture treatment and the factors that affect prognosis.

We observed an unusually high number of patients with complications referred to our institution. It was the purpose of this study to report these complications, as well as their treatment and outcome. Materials and methods: From 2003 to 2010, all patients treated for complications after ORIF with locking plates for proximal humeral fractures were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Patients were followed up clinically and radiographically. Results: In total, 121 patients (67 women and 54 men; mean age, 59 years) were referred after primary locking plate ORIF; 80% had a 3- or 4-part fracture. A mean of 3 complications occurred per patient, including malreduction, primary screw cutout, malunion, nonunion, avascular necrosis, and infection. Secondary screw cutout was found in 57% of patients, causing glenoid destruction in 33% of patients. A mean of 1.5 revision surgeries were needed. Hemiarthroplasty, total shoulder arthroplasty, and reverse shoulder arthroplasty improved the mean Constant score (24 to 55 points, P < .05; 29 to 54 points, P = .3; and 25 to 48 points, P < .05, respectively) after a mean of 24 months. In 6 patients, glenoid implantation was no longer possible because of the destruction by perforated head screws. Conclusion: In this negatively selected series, complications resulted in secondary arthroplasties in over 50% of the patients. Shoulder function, though improved, remained substantially restricted even after revision surgery. Glenoid destruction by locking screws was the most devastating and previously almost unseen complication, which limited the options of treatment.

The samples are fixed with two kinds of fixatives, glutaraldehyde and osmium-tetra oxide acid. After the fixation and replacement procedure with t-buthyl alcohol, the samples followed by a freeze drying, well retain their structures. Surface structures, cilia and microfibrillar systems including infraciliary lattice structures, are clearly depicted by SEM observation. On the other hand, XRM images give quite different information, namely, in the case of osmium oxide fixation, the structures of internal organelles like the macronucleus placed in the central part of cell body and trichocysts located under the cell membrane of a whole body are visible. In the case of glutaraldehyde fixation, the surface structures and internal structures are both visible but their image contrast is fairly weak. In order to examine toxicological effect, Paramecium caudatum samples treated in the environmental condition containing nano-particles of Ag (17 nm across) and Co-ferrite (300 nm across) are observed with results of certain morphological differences, namely, inner vacuoles increase in number and in volume in Co-ferrite treated cells as compared with Ag treated ones. But then, cilia-less areas increase on the surface of the body of Ag treated cells. In the case of Co-ferrite treated cells, cilia-less areas are not clearly detected. Whether these morphological differences observed in Ag and Co-ferrite treated cells are caused by the differences of materials or particle sizes remain to be examined in future.

Material/Methods: Of the 197 femoral neck fracture cases treated via closed reduction and cancellous screws fixation from January 2006 to February 2010, 110 were followed up. Patient age, gender, operative time, implantation method, reduction quality, fracture type, bone mineral density, loading time, length of hospital stay, and Harris hip score 12 months after operation were recorded. The patients were divided into two groups (shortening and non-shortening) based on their X-ray performance during follow-up. The healing rates and Harris hip scores of the two groups were compared, and the influencing factors of femoral neck shortening were analyzed. Results: Of the 110 cases followed up, 94.5% (104/110) were healed and neck shortening occurred in 41.8% (46/110) within 12.5 months (mean) after treatment. The Harris hip score of the shortening group was lower than that of the non-shortening group (78 +/- 17 vs. 86 +/- 23, p=0.048). The fracture healing rates of the two groups were not significantly different (p=0.068). The factors influencing neck shortening were significantly correlated with bone mineral density, patient age, gender, and type of fracture. Conclusions: The incidence of neck shortening in elderly patients treated for femoral neck fracture using cancellous screws was high. Bone mineral density, patient age, gender, and type of fracture were the influencing factors of neck shortening.

Material and methods: The transparotid approach was used in 38 patients with unilateral condylar fracture. In four cases a single 2.0 plate was used, in the latter 3D plates were used. All the patients were subjected to control clinical examination including: occlusion, facial nerve function, mandibular movements, pain presence, subjective assessment of the scar aesthetics and the presence of salivary fistula or salivary cyst on the first day following surgery and after 1, 3 and 6 months. Control radiography of the mandible in at least two projections was made on the first day after surgery and after 3 months. Results: In 3 patients a partial paresis of the facial nerve was noticed followed by a spontaneous recovery 3 months postoperatively. In 2 patients acoustic effects, without pain in the temporomandibular joint of the fractured side were still present 6 months postoperatively. Plate fractures were found in two out of four patients operated on with single-plate technique. Loosening and displacement of a fixation screw occurred in 4 patients; in 3 cases it referred to a single 2.0 plate and in one, a Delta plate. Post-operation scar was accepted by all the patients. Conclusion: The transparotid approach allows for direct visualisation of the fracture providing proper reduction and osteosynthesis, with a low risk of facial nerve paresis. Precise wound closure in layers, especially of the parotid capsule allows avoiding a salivary fistula. (C) 2015 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Does external fixator pin site distance from definitive implant affect infection rate in pilon fractures?	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Pilon fracture; Distal tibia fracture; External fixation; Staged care; Infection; Infection risk; Deep infection; Complication	TIBIAL PLAFOND; RISK-FACTORS; MANAGEMENT	Introduction: Tibial pilon fractures are often treated with initial external fixation followed by delayed definitive fixation. It has been postulated that the external fixator pin site may correlate with infection risk. The purpose of this study was to determine whether external fixator pin-site distance from definitive implants impacts the risk of deep infection in pilon fractures. Materials and methods: A retrospective cohort study was completed at a single level 1 trauma center. All patients ages 15-65 who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of a distal tibial fracture (AO/OTA Classification 43) from 2007 to 2013 were included. The final study population was 133 patients. The impact of external fixation pin location (relative to the definitive implant location) on postoperative infection was measured. Results: As a continuous variable, the distance between the closest pin site and plate was 62.1 +/- 44.1 mm in the infected cohort and 62.2 +/- 49.7 mm in the non-infected cohort (p = 0.991). Further analysis was performed by grouping the distances into less than 0 mm (i.e. overlapping), >0.0 - 25.0 mm, >25.0 50.0 mm, >50.0 - 75.0 mm, >75.0 - 100.0 mm, and >100.0 mm of separation. No significant differences were noted with regards to the risk for infection. Conclusions: Staged care has been shown to be an effective treatment strategy for AO/OTA type 43 fractures. There are many variables to consider when placing an external fixator construct. In this cohort, pin site distance from definitive implant location was not associated with an increase in deep infections. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Transoral Fixation of Bicortical Screws Is Safe and Feasible for Lower Jaw Osteotomies	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							SAGITTAL RAMUS OSTEOTOMY; MANDIBULAR ADVANCEMENT; INTERNAL-FIXATION; SPLIT OSTEOTOMY; COMPLICATIONS; SURGERY	Purpose: Transoral placement of bicortical screws is a rigid fixation method in orthognathic surgery that is used less often than transbuccal placement. The aim of this study was to examine the postoperative outcome of transoral bicortical screw insertion during orthognathic surgery and to compare it with the more common transbuccal fixation technique. Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Clinical files of orthognathic surgery patients operated on from January 2010 through December 2012 were reviewed. Screw insertion approach (transoral vs transbuccal) was examined as a predictive variable for postoperative complications (hardware removal and infection). Type of surgery, fibrin sealant, preoperative third molar removal, and patient age and gender were analyzed as potential risk factors. Descriptive and bivariate statistics and regression analyses were performed. Results: Of the 606 patients whose cases were reviewed, 509 patients (185 men; mean age, 26.3 +/- 11.1 yr) met the inclusion criteria. Most presented with a Class II malocclusion (84.5%). A transbuccal approach was used in 27.5% of cases, leading to a screw-related infection of 6.3%. Patients treated with a transoral technique (72.5%) had fewer infections (3.5%), but this was not statistically relevant. Screw removal was indicated in 3.3% of patients. Screw placement using the transoral and transbuccal approaches was performed in 3.0 and 4.2% of patients, respectively. Infection and screw removal rates did not differ significantly between fixation techniques (P = .16 and P = .49, respectively). Conclusion: The present findings showed an overall low rate of screw removal and infection secondary to bicortical screw insertion during orthognathic surgery. The postoperative outcome was similar for the transoral and transbuccal approaches.

We planned to compare time of healing, need for revision and incidence of complications between the two groups. Results Union occurred in 53 patients (88.33 %) in both groups, 25 cases (83.3 %) in group A and 28 cases (93.3 %) in group B, including three cases (5 %) with avascular necrosis (AVN): two in group A (6.7 %) and one case in group B (3.3 %). Revision surgery was done for six cases (20 %) in group A and for two cases (6.7 %) in group B. In both groups, all united cases had good to excellent clinical outcome as regards Harris hip score (HHS) at the end of the follow up. Conclusion Despite advances in surgical techniques and medical care, the risk of nonunion and avascular necrosis (AVN) after treatment of femoral neck fractures have not been changed appreciably in the last 50 years. Results of this study generally showed that both the median clinical and radiographic healing time were lower in group B compared to group A.

We hypothesized that the stability of composite plates and screws forged from unsintered hydroxyapatite particles and poly-L-lactide (u-HA/PLLA) is comparable to that of standard titanium fixation systems for the reduction of fractures of load-bearing regions of the mandibular body. Materials and methods: 40 patients underwent open reduction and internal fixation of the fractured mandibular body with either a titanium or u-HA/PLLA bone plate. Cone-beam CT images were obtained immediately postoperatively and at 6-month follow-up, and were analyzed for positional changes of the affected mandible. Results: There were no significant differences in the postoperative positional changes of reference points between the titanium and u-HA/PLLA miniplates, except for that for the coronoid process (pvalue = 0.03). Multivariate regression analysis revealed no significant differences in spatial changes between the immediate postoperative and 6-month follow-up images, after adjusting for age and sex. Conclusion: The stability of bioresorbable u-HA/PLLA miniplates and screws was comparable to that of titanium miniplates and screws immediately postoperatively and at 6-month follow-up, following surgical reduction of fractures of load-bearing regions of the mandibular body. Bioresorbable osteosynthesis can be considered a viable alternative to titanium osteosynthesis. 2019 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

How well can step-off and gap distances be reduced when treating intra-articular distal radius fractures with fragment specific fixation when using fluoroscopy	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Distal radius fracture; Intra-articular; Fluoroscopy; Fragment specific fixation; Gap distance; Step-off distance	INTERNAL-FIXATION; EXTERNAL FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; INJURIES; END	Introduction: Although fragment specific fixation has proved to be an effective treatment regime, it has not been established how successfully this treatment could be performed using fluoroscopy and what the added value of arthroscopy could be. Establish gap and step-off distances after in intra-articular distal radius fractures that have been treated with fragment specific fixation while using fluoroscopy. Material: Forty-four patients with an intra-articular distal radius fracture were treated with fragment specific fixation while using fluoroscopy. Methods: After the treatment of the intra-articular distal radius fracture with fragment specific fixation and the use of fluoroscopy, but before the completion of the surgical intervention, all gap, and step-off distances were determined by using arthroscopy. In addition, the joint was checked for any other wrist pathologies. Results: Arthroscopy after the surgical intervention showed that in 37 patients no gap distances could be detected, while in six patients a gap distance of <= 2 mm was found and in one patient, a gap distance of 3 mm. Similarly, arthroscopy revealed no step-off distances in 33 patients, while in 11 patients a step-off distance of <= 2 mm was found. Although additional wrist pathologies were found in 48% of our population, only one patient needed surgical intervention. Three months after the surgical intervention wrist flexion was 41 +/- 10 degrees, wrist extension 51 +/- 17 degrees, ulnar deviation 19 +/- 10 degrees, radial deviation 32 +/- 12 degrees while patients could pronate and supinate their wrist to 85 +/- 5 degrees and 74 +/- 20 degrees, respectively. Conclusion: Intra-articular distal radius fractures can be treated successfully with fragment specific fixation and the use of fluoroscopy. As almost all gap and step-off distances could be reduced to an acceptable level, the scope for arthroscopy to further improve this treatment regime is limited. The functional outcome scores that were found 3 months after the surgical intervention were similar to what has been reported in other studies using different treatment option. These findings suggest that fragment specific fixation is a good alternative for treating intra-articular distal radius fractures. As in most cases, only fluoroscopy is needed for fragment specific fixation, this treatment technique is a good treatment option for resource-limited hospitals, setting who do not have access to arthroscopy.

Osteopenia and thin cortices complicate orthopedic treatment in this group. This study evaluates the clinical results of a bone splint technique for the treatment of lower limb deformities in children with type I OI. The technique consists of internal plating combined with cortical strut allograft fixation. Materials and Methods: We prospectively followed nine children (five boys, four girls) with lower limb deformities due to type I OI, who had been treated with the bone splint technique (11 femurs, four tibias) between 2003 and 2006. The fracture healing time, deformity improvement, ambulation ability and complications were recorded to evaluate treatment effects. Results: At the time of surgery the average age in our study was 7.7 years (range 5-12 years). The average length of followup was 69 months (range 60-84 months). All patients had good fracture healing with an average healing time of 14 weeks (range 12-16 weeks) and none experienced further fractures, deformity, or nonunion. The fixation remained stable throughout the procedure in all cases, with no evidence of loosening or breakage of screws and the deformity and mobility significantly improved after surgery. Of the two children confined to bed before surgery, one was able to walk on crutches and the other needed a wheelchair. The other seven patients could walk without walking aids or support like crutches. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the bone splint technique provides good mechanical support and increases the bone mass. It is an effective treatment for children with OI and lower limb deformities.

Compared with younger patients, elderly patients with rib fracture have a higher incidence of complications and mortality. A retrospective study was conducted to investigate the effect of internal fixation compared with conservative treatment on the outcome of rib fracture in elderly patients.Material and methodsWe used a 1:1 propensity score matching method to perform a retrospective analysis of 703 elderly patients with rib fractures treated in the Thoracic Surgery Department of Beijing Jishuitan Hospital between 2013 and 2020. After matching, the length of hospital stay, death, symptom relief and rib fracture healing were compared between the surgery and the control group.ResultsThe study included 121 patients receiving SSRF in the surgery group and 121 patients receiving conservative treatment in the control group. The length of hospital stay in the surgery group was significantly longer than that in the conservative group (11.39d vs. 9.48d, p = 0.000). After 9 months of follow-up, the fracture healing rate in the surgery group was significantly higher than that in the control group (96.67% vs. 88.89%, p = 0.020). The fracture healing time (p = 0.000), improvement in pain score (p = 0.000) and duration of pain medication use (p = 0.000) were also significantly better in the surgery group than in the control group.ConclusionCompared with conservative treatment, surgical treatment can prolong hospital stay to some extent. However, it has the advantages of more rapid healing and lessened pain. For rib fractures in elderly individuals, surgical treatment is a safe and effective option under strict surgical indications and is recommended.

Materials and Methods: The records of 295 consecutive patients with facial fractures treated by open reduction and internal fixation, performed by the author from 2001 through 2004, were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were selected to receive biodegradable fixation on the basis of mechanism of injury, the degree of bony displacement demonstrated on clinical and radiographic examination, patient age, and fracture pattern or location. Outcome measures such as infection, non-union, and mal-union were identified and subjectively assessed. Descriptive statistics were recorded and analyzed. Results: Two hundred eighty-one patients met the criteria for inclusion in the study with follow-up of 3 weeks to 3 years. Fifty-nine (21%) patients were identified as having received biodegradable plates and screws. All patients eventually went on to satisfactory healing with favorable restoration of form and function. Complications occurred in 16 patients overall (6%). Of these, 2 patients were treated with resorbable plates and screws; I patient with a zygomatico-maxillary complex fracture developed a sterile abscess that presented 1 year postoperatively and responded to local measures. Another patient with a Le Fort I fracture developed an anterior open bite necessitating Le Fort I osteotomy for correction. Conclusions: Favorable healing can be observed through the use of biodegradable PL plates and screws to stabilize selected midface fractures in patients of all ages, as well as mandible fractures in early childhood.

In situations where a bone fracture occurs, our intention is to surgically position in an appropriate morpho-anatomical position. For osteosynthesis we used vipla wire and micro plates with corresponding screws.The aim of our research was to evaluate the optimal time for the removal of the osteosynthetic material, fracture site biomechanical stability, and measurement of the callus thickness.For this research ten 4 months old rabbits with right leg femur fracture were used. Osteosynthesis was done with titanium micro plates, corresponding screws and vipla wire. Experimental animals were observed through the post-operative period at the first and seventh postoperative day and there on at 2, 4, 6, 9, 12 weeks. Further additional fixation was needed in one of the rabbits in the second week.The postoperative period provided us information about the optimal moment for the removal of titanium micro plates. It showed that over a period of six weeks, the bone had almost all normal biomechanical properties. Significantly greater strength and rigidity of the recovered femur were obtained after 12 weeks. Micro plates that were removed after 4, 6 or 9 weeks, did not need furhter fixation and therefore fixation was not applied, compared to those placed during the 12 weeks. X Ray evaluation provided us with follow up results of fracture healing.The results suggest that it is acceptable to remove titanium micro plates after a period of healing, that is, after the formation of the callus and bridging of the fracture gap and diastasis with newly formed bone.

The dorsal ulnar corner (DUC) can be difficult to stabilize as the fragment is small and not exposed when using the volar approach. The purpose of this study was to study fracture fragment migration after VLPF of AO type C DRF, using a volume registration technique of paired CT scans with special focus on the DUC fragment.Materials and Methods This pilot study included ten patients with AO type C DRF, all operated with VLPF. The primary outcome was radiographic outcome. Postoperative and 1-year scans were compared and analyzed. Fragment migration was assessed with CT-based micromotion analysis (CTMA), a software technique used for volume registration of paired CT scans.Results All plates were stable over time. Two patients showed signs of screw movement (0.2-0.35 mm and 0.35- > 1 mm respectively). Postoperative reduction was maintained, and there was no fragment migration at the 1-year follow-up except for one case with increased dorsal tilt. The DUC fragment was found in 8/10 cases, fixated in 7/8 cases, and not dislocated in any case at the 1-year follow-up.Conclusion The CTMA results indicate that variable-angle VLPF after AO type C DRF can yield and maintain a highly stable reduction of the fracture fragments. The DUC fragment remained stable regardless of the number of screws through the fragment. CT volume registration can be a valuable tool in the detailed assessment of fracture fragment migration following volar plate fixation of DRFs.

We introduce a surgical robot system from China based on 3-dimensional fluoroscopy imaging and compare it with the commonly used O-arm navigation system. We study the differences in accuracy, safety, and clinical effect in auxiliary pedicle screw fixation. Material/Methods: Patients who underwent thoracolumbar internal fixation in our hospital from 2017 to 2019 were divided into a robot and navigation group according to whether surgery was assisted by the Tinavi orthopedic robot or O-arm navigation system. Imaging data of patients were searched from the image system and accuracy of screw implantation was measured by Rampersaud A to D grade classification. Deviation sagittal, deviation transversal, and facet joint violation were also measured and calculated. Results: In total, 306 patients were included: 136 patients in the robot group with 760 screws implanted; 166 patients in the navigation group with 908 screws implanted. The accuracy of "perfect" and "clinically acceptable" pedicle screw implantation was 96.2% and 99.6%, respectively, in the robot group and 90.5% and 96.7%, respectively, in the navigation group, with a significant difference between the 2 groups (P<0.05). The sagittal and transversal deviations in the robot group were significantly less than those in the navigation group (P<0.05). Conclusions: The Tinavi orthopedic robot can significantly improve surgical accuracy and safety of pedicle screw fixation, as compared with that of O-arm navigation technology, without increasing complications. It shows great potential in clinical application.

J	Ahmed, AR; Sweed, T; Wanas, A				Ahmed, Adel Refaat; Sweed, Tamer; Wanas, Adel			The role of cancellous screw with tension band fixation in the treatment of displaced olecranon fractures, a comparative study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND TRAUMATOLOGY			English	Article						Olecranon fractures; Cancellous screw with tension band	INTERNAL-FIXATION; MANAGEMENT; ADULTS; ELBOW	Introduction Fractures of the olecranon are among the most common injuries involving the upper extremity and require operative intervention if displaced. The most commonly used method of fixation for this type of fracture is the AO tension band wiring, although the results of this technique have been generally good, still problems have occurred, including loss of fixation, nonunion, and high re-operation rate for hardware removal. Aim of the study To compare the results of treatment of displaced fractures of the olecranon using AO tension band wiring versus intramedullary screw with tension band. Materials and methods In a prospective study, 30 patients with transverse or oblique olecranon fractures, were randomly divided into two equal groups, one group treated using AO tension band wiring the other group using an intramedullary cancellous screw plus tension band. Results In the screw plus tension band group, 11 (73.3%) patients had excellent results, four (26.7%) had good results and none had fair or poor results, only one(6.6%) patient required second operation for removal of prominent hardware. In the AO tension band group, six (40%) patients had excellent results, five (33.3%) had good, three (20%) had fair and one (6.7%) patient had poor result, and eight patients (53.3%) required second operation for removal of prominent hardware. Conclusion Using an intramedullary screw combined with tension band in treatment of displaced transverse and oblique olecranon fractures gives better clinical results and has much less re-operation rate for removal of hardware when compared to AO tension band wire fixation, avoiding costs, work time loss and possible complications from hardware removal.

Nevertheless, surgical treatment is justified in certain cases. Palmar dislocation of >30degrees and shortening of >5 mm will significantly affect extension and flexion of the hand. Consequently, surgical treatment is indicated. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical results of intramedullary Kirschner-wire fixation of metacarpal fractures. Material and methods: In a retrospective study we analyzed the clinical results of 35 patients with metacarpal fractures that had been treated by closed reduction and elastic fixation with at least two intramedullary k-wires. Results: Most of the patients were young, with good bone quality and low anesthetic risk, and they had suffered the fractures as a result of a direct trauma. Predominantly uncomplicated, the fractures were metaphyseal, subcapital and of the fifth metacarpal bone (750.3-B1 fractures). Surgical treatment was indicated for a palmar axis dislocation of >20degrees or if a rotatory deficiency was present. Metacarpal joint function and correction of rotatory displacement could be assessed on median after a period of 1.1 year. In 34 patients flexion and extension was normal on both sides. In one patient we found an extension deficiency of 15degrees and a rotatory deficiency of 10degrees. In 34 out 35 patients with metacarpal fractures, minimally invasive intramedullary k-wire osteosynthesis resulted in complete restoration. Conclusions: Intramedullary k-wire fixation is a minimally invasive method for stabilizing metacarpal fractures. The excellent long-term clinical results are due to the fact that the gliding tissue around the fracture will not be affected at all by the surgical procedure.

Due to being in a period of continuous growth and development, the spine of children at different ages shows different characteristics from adults in terms of anatomy, physiological function, and biomechanics. Furthermore, because the pedicle of children is small, has large anatomic variation, and has complex adjacent relationships, the surgical risk is extremely high. How to improve the screwing accuracy is the key to the success of children's pedicle internal fixation. Therefore, applying the concept of digitized and individualized screwing will be of great significance to children's pedicle screwing. Aim: To investigate the morphologies, development patterns, and aging characteristics of the lumbar vertebral pedicle (LVP) in children aged 6-11 years, and to provide a theoretical basis for screw implantation and related biomechanical studies. Material and methods: A total of 60 children aged 6-11 years were selected for the intergroup measurement and statistical analysis of their lumbar diameter, pedicle diameter, screw canal length (SCL), etc. Results: Generally, the vertebral foramen diameter (ID), sagittal diameter (SD), pedicle width (PW), and SCL as well as the pedicle height (PH) exhibited an increasing trend with age and increasing vertebral sequence among children aged 6-11 years. Conclusions: By observing the LVP in children using 3D digital reconstruction technology, the morphology of the spinal canal and pedicles at different lumbar segments showed obvious development patterns, and the best treatment protocol should be selected according to the LVP characteristics in clinical applications.

Materials and methods: Fifty polyurethane hemimandibles with sagittal split ramus osteotomy and containing an advancement of 10 mm fixed and distributed as follows: Customized 3D Plate Group: 1 customized 3D miniplate; 4-Hole Plate Group: 2 miniplates with 4 holes; 6-Hole Plate Group: 2 miniplates with 6 holes; Hybrid Group: 1 flat miniplate with 4 holes and 1 bicortical screw; and Bicortical Screw Group: 3 bicortical screws. We conducted a mechanical test using vertical linear loading with a displacement velocity of 1 mm/min on a universal testing machine and assessed the screw insertion torque using a digital torque wrench. Results: The means of strength for the 1-, 3- and 5-mm displacements were determined by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the post hoc Tukey test. Statistically significant differences were observed only for the 5-mm displacement (F = 3.36; p = 0.01). There was a difference between the 4-H2P and HG groups (p = 0.04). Conclusion: The customized miniplate, the fixation methods with three bicortical screws, or with two straight miniplates with either 4 or 6 holes, all offer a similar mechanical resistance suitable for fixation.

Charcot arthropathy may lead to a loss of osteoligamentous foot architecture and consequently loss of the plantigrade alignment. In this series of patients a technique of internal corrective arthrodesis with maximum fixation strength was provided in order to lower complication rates. Materials/Methods. 21 feet with severe nonplantigrade diabetic Charcot deformity Eichenholtz stages II/III (Sanders/Frykberg II/III/IV) and reconstructive arthrodesis with medial and additional lateral column support were retrospectively enrolled. Follow-up averaged 4.0 years and included a clinical (AOFAS score/PSS), radiological, and complication analysis. Results. A mean of 2.4 complications/foot occurred, of which 1.5/foot had to be solved surgically. 76% of feet suffered from soft tissue complications; 43% suffered hardware-associated complications. Feet with only 2 out of 5 high risk criteria according to Pinzur showed significantly lower complication counts. Radiographs revealed a correct restoration of all foot axes postoperatively with superior fixation strength medially. Conclusion. Late corrective arthrodesis with medial and lateral column stabilization in the nonplantigrade stages of neuroosteoarthropathy can provide reasonable reconstruction of the foot alignment. Nonetheless, overall complication/reoperation rates were high. With separation into low/high risk criteria a helpful guide in treatment choice is provided.

There are yet few articles investigating the efficacy of bicolumnar dorsal plating technique, which is designed to minimize tissue dissection while providing sufficiently secure fixation. A clinical study was performed to evaluate the feasibility of the minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) technique using a modified dorsal approach for the treatment of distal radius fractures. Materials and Methods: Thirty patients with unilateral distal radius fracture who underwent bicolumnar plate fixation with a minimally invasive dorsal approach between September 2008 and December 2010 were included in this retrospective study. Twenty four patients (8 men and 16 women) with a mean age of 53 years (range 18-85 years) were available for followup of at least 1 year or more were included in final study. Herein, we report the functional radiological outcomes of the study. There were three cases of AO Type A fracture, five cases of AO Type B fracture, and 16 cases of AO Type C fracture. Results: The union was achieved in all the patients. The functional results at one-year followup, assessed using the modified Gartland and Werley scoring system, were excellent in 14 patients, good in seven patients, and fair in three patients. The average correction of deformity was 4.1 mm for radial height, 7.6 degrees for radial inclination, and 20.7 degrees for volar tilt. Conclusions: MIPO with a dorsal approach is a feasible option for the management of displaced distal radius fractures and can result in favorable surgical outcomes.

Fixation of Extra-Articular Distal Humerus Fractures Using One Locking Plate Versus Two Reconstruction Plates: A Laboratory Study	JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE			English	Article						Distal humerus fracture; Osteosynthesis; Locking plate; Plating	INVASIVE STABILIZATION SYSTEM; BIOMECHANICAL EVALUATION; INTERNAL-FIXATION; SHAFT FRACTURES; DIAPHYSEAL FRACTURES; SURGICAL EXPERIENCE; FEMUR FRACTURES; TIBIA FRACTURES	Objective: To compare the strength and stiffness of standard double-plate fixation with that of a single-locking plate for comminuted extra-articular distal humeral fractures. Materials: Eight matched pairs of humeri were used: One of each pair was fixed with two 3.5-mm standard reconstruction plates applied dorsally; the other was fixed with one precontoured locking plate applied to the posterior aspect of the lateral column. A 1-cm gap was created to simulate a distal fracture model with 100% metaphyseal comminution with no bony apposition. Stiffness testing of these constructs was performed in axial compression, anterior, posterior and lateral bending, and torsion. They were then cyclically loaded for 40110 cycles with 60 N in posterior bending and the stiffnesses re-tested. Finally, each construct was posteriorly loaded to failure to determine its ultimate strength. Results: The double-plate construct was significantly stiffer than the one locking plate construct in anterior bending (39%; p = 0.02), posterior bending (23%; p = 0.04), and lateral bending (60%; p = 0.01). No significant stiffness differences were seen in axial compression and torsion (p = 0.64 and 0.25, respectively). After cyclic loading, all construct stiffnesses were relatively unchanged. Both construct types had similar failure strengths (p = 0.76) of approximately 400 N. Conclusions: Double-plating provides a more rigid fixation than a single-locked plate for fixation of extra-articular comminuted distal humeral fractures. This could be clinically relevant in situations with 100% comminution as seen in gun shot injuries.

Materials and Methods: The following screws were tested: AO partially threaded 4-mm cancellous screw, AO 3.5- and 2.7-mm cortical screws (Synthes - USA), self-tapping cannulated 3-mm VisAntares (FOS - France), 3- and 2.3-mm Omnitech (Biotech - France), 3-mm Barouk (DePuy - France), and 3-mm Bold screws (Newdeal - France). The compression forces of screws in bone were tested using a load cell between pieces of longitudinally-split sheep tibias as a cortical and cancellous bone model. Results: The AO 3.5-mm, 2.7-mm cortical anti 4.0-mm partially threaded cancellous headed screws provided significantly (p <= 0.05) better compression forces than all the tested headless screws, both in cortical and cancellous bone. A loss of compression was noted when the headless screws were totally countersunk. Conclusion: The cortical and cancellous screws with heads provided superior compression than headless screws. Clinical Relevance: Headed screws may be preferable to headless differential pitch screws in situations where compression is important ie, arthrodeses or fracture fixation. Care should be taken not to countersink the headless screws during insertion into cortical bone.

Biomechanical evaluation of parallel versus orthogonal plate fixation of intra-articular distal humerus fractures	JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY			English	Article						Distal humerus; fracture; intra-articular; fixation; plate; parallel; orthogonal; biomechanical	INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; ELBOW JOINT; STABILITY; SYSTEMS; ADULT	Background: Orthogonal and parallel plate constructs are used for fixation of intra-articular distal humerus fractures but optimal plate configuration remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to compare the biomechanical properties of orthogonal versus parallel plate constructs in a cadaver distal humerus fracture model. Material and methods: An intra-articular distal humerus fracture with a metaphyseal defect was created in 14 matched pairs of cadaver elbows. Paired specimens were fixed with either orthogonal or parallel plates from a single elbow plating system using nonlocking screws. Using a novel testing protocol, loading was applied to the forearm and was transmitted to the distal humerus through intact collateral ligaments, olecranon, and radial head. Seven matched pairs were tested under varus loading and seven under axial/sagittal loading. Each specimen underwent cyclic loading first, followed by loading to failure. Results: Parallel plate constructs had significantly higher stiffness than orthogonal ones during cyclic varus loading (P = .002). Screw loosening occurred in all posterior plates of orthogonal constructs but in no plates of parallel constructs (P = .001). Parallel constructs had significantly higher ultimate torque in varus loading to failure (20.7 vs 15.9 Nm, P = .008), and higher ultimate load in axial/sagittal loading to failure (1287.8 vs 800.0 N, P = .03). Discussion: Parallel plating of intra-articular distal humerus fractures with a metaphyseal defect demonstrates superior biomechanical properties compared to orthogonal plating, and may be preferable for fixation of these fractures.

Several studies cite screw positioning variables such as the number and spacing of screws as responsible for occurrences of locking plate breakage, screw loosening, and peri-prosthetic re-fracture. It is also widely accepted that inappropriate device stiffness can inhibit or delay healing. Careful preoperative planning is therefore critical if these failures are to be prevented. This study examines several variables which need to be considered when optimising a locking plate fixation device for fracture treatment including: material selection; screw placement; the effect of the fracture pattern; and the bone-plate offset. We demonstrate that device selection is not straight-forward as many of the variables influence one-another and an identically configured device can perform very differently depending upon the fracture pattern. Finally, we summarise the influence of some of the key parameters and the influence this can have on the fracture healing environment and the stresses within the plate in a flowchart.

Material and Methods: The finite element model that imitates three-dimensional sagittal split advancement osteot-omy was fixed in 10 different miniplate fixation methods: one miniplate fixed with four monocortical screws in a horizontal and oblique pattern; four-hole two miniplates with eight monocortical screws; five-hole miniplate fixed with four monocortical and one bicortical screws; six-hole straight and curved miniplates fixed with six monocor-tical screws in different geometric designs. Unilateral masticatory muscle loads that have previously determined in the literature were applied to the model at the anatomical muscle attachment regions and the data obtained from finite element analysis and static linear analysis methods were recorded as Von mises, maximum principle and minimum principle stress values.Results: It was observed from the results that maximum stress occurred in Group 1, which consisted of double backward T-shaped miniplate with 6-holes and, minimum stress occured in group 10, which mimiced hybrid sys-tem with one miniplate and four monocortical and one bicortical screws.Conclusions: Based on our results, the stress on the miniplates changes according to the geometric designs and the stress on the miniplate decreases as the numbers of miniplates and bars increase. The hybrid miniplate may be preferred by the surgeon as it will be exposed to less stress in excessive mandibular advancements by using the advantages of both the miniplate and the bicortical screw.

Biomechanical aspects of the posteromedial split in bicondylar tibial plateau fractures-a finite-element investigation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND EMERGENCY SURGERY			English	Article						Biomechanics; Bicondylar tibial plateau fracture; Finite-element method; Posteromedial split; Fixation	INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; CLASSIFICATION; STABILIZATION; DESIGN; KNEE	Purpose To gain principal insight into fixation techniques of a posteromedial split fragment in bicondylar tibial plateau fractures. Methods A computer simulation was performed, applying the finite-element method (FEM) to compare four methods of fixation of the posteromedial split fragment: lateral plate (model 1), lateral plate and kickstand screw (model 2), lateral plate and two antero-posterior lag screws (model 3), and lateral and posteromedial plate (model 4). The displacement of the fragment and material stresses in implants and bone under 2500 N axial load were analyzed. Results Maximal displacement of the posteromedial split fragment of 2.8 mm was found with a sole lateral plate. An added kickstand screw decreased the displacement to 1.46 mm. Added lag screws improved stability by a factor 4, with a maximal displacement of 0.76 mm. The double-plate configuration revealed 0.27 mm, a decrease of the displacement by a factor 10 compared to model 1. An additional analysis of posteromedial fragment displacements with osteoporotic bone, simulated by dividing the elastic modulus of the bone by a factor 2, turned out to be of relevant impact. For model 1, the calculations did not converge. The influence of bone quality was found to be 70% in model 2, 60% in model 3, and 40% in model 4. Conclusions The results indicate that the additional fixation of a posteromedial split fracture by plate osteosynthesis might be advantageous in bicondylar tibial plateau fractures treated with lateral plating. This might be even more important in patients with low bone quality.

Early definitive management reduces risk of immediate complications Lis well as chronic pain and gait dysfunction. Conventional operative therapy carries substantial risk of extensive blood loss and iatrogenic neurological and vascular injury. Minimally invasive image-guided intervention may further reduce immediate risk and improve long-term outcome. Objective: To describe CT-guided closed reduction and internal fixation (CRIF) and review outcomes of unstable fracture-dislocation of the sacroiliac (SI) joint in children. Materials and methods: Between 2000 and 2003, three children (two girls, one boy) age 8-14 years were referred to interventional radiology for treatment of unstable SI joint fracture-dislocation not adequately treated with anterior external fixation alone. Results: The three affected SI joints (two left, one right) were treated in a combined approach by pediatric interventional radiologists and orthopedic surgeons, using a percutaneous approach under CT guidance. Over a threaded guiding pin, 7.3 mm cannulated screws were used to achieve stable reduction of the affected SI joints. One screw was removed after slight (2 mm) migration. No neurovascular or other complications occurred. All patients had satisfactory healing with near-anatomic reduction, although recovery of the youngest was delayed by associated spinal injury. Conclusions: Compared to open surgical alternatives, CRIF under CT guidance reduces operating time, decreases blood loss, and allows early definitive fixation and immediate non-weight-bearing mobilization with a low rate of complication for unstable posterior pelvic ring fractures. In addition, CT-guided placement of the guide pin may allow safer screw positioning and may minimize the total number of screws needed to achieve pelvic stability.

Neuronavigation in Endonasal Pituitary and Skull Base Surgery Using an Autoregistration Mask without Head Fixation: An Assessment of Accuracy and Practicality	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SURGERY PART A-CENTRAL EUROPEAN NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						endonasal transsphenoidal surgery; navigation; endoscopic surgery; patient positioning; pituitary adenoma; skull base tumor	ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY; NAVIGATION ACCURACY	Background Intraoperative navigation is an important tool used during endonasal surgery, which typically requires rigid head fixation. Herein we describe a navigational technique using an autoregistration mask without head fixation. Material and Methods Prospective evaluation of a surface autoregistration mask used without rigid head fixation in 12 consecutive endonasal endoscopic skull base procedures was performed with patients positioned in a horseshoe head holder. We assessed the accuracy by recording the surface registration error (SRE) and target registration error (TRE). We also noted the time required for installation and the occurrence of system failure. The system's accuracy was validated using a deep target simultaneously viewed with endoscopic. Results In 12 consecutive endonasal cases performed by a neurosurgeon and ENT team, pathologies included pituitary macroadenomas (9), chordoma (1), craniopharyngioma (1), and sinonasal melanoma (1). Median time required for the registration and accuracy verification was 84 seconds (interval 64 to 129 seconds). The mask stayed on the patient throughout the procedure. The mean SRE was 0.8 mm (interval 0.6 to 0.9 mm). The mean TRE was 0.9 +/- 0.7 mmand 1.0 +/- 0.8 mm measured respectively at the beginning and end of the case. In every case, the system was judged accurate by the surgical team using the sphenoid keel or an intrasphenoidal bony septation as a deep target for internal validation. No system failure occurred during these 12 cases. Conclusion A facial surface autoregistration mask maintained in place throughout surgery without rigid head fixation allows excellent operational accuracy in endonasal pituitary and skull base surgery. This navigation system is practical, reliable, and noninvasive.

Allograft versus autograft for pediatric posterior cervical and occipito-cervical fusion: a systematic review of factors affecting fusion rates	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS			English	Article						cervical; occipital; fusion; allograft; bone morphogenetic protein; pediatric; spine	RIGID INTERNAL-FIXATION; PEDICLE SCREW FIXATION; TRAUMATIC ATLANTOOCCIPITAL DISLOCATION; ATLANTOAXIAL INSTRUMENTED FUSIONS; BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN-2; MALFORMATION TYPE-I; C-1 LATERAL MASS; CRANIOVERTEBRAL JUNCTION; SPINAL-FUSION; BASILAR INVAGINATION	OBJECTIVE Fusion rates are high for children undergoing posterior cervical fusion (PCF) and occipito-cervical fusion (OCF). Autologous bone has been widely used as the graft material of choice, despite the risk of donor-site morbidity associated with harvesting the bone, possibly because very low fusion rates were reported with posterior allograft cervical fusions in children several decades ago. Higher overall fusion rates using allograft in adults, associated with improvements in internal fixation techniques and the availability of osteoinductive substances such as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), have led to heightened enthusiasm for the use of bank bone during pediatric PCF. A systematic review was performed to study factors associated with successful bone fusion, including the type of bone graft used. METHODS The authors performed a comprehensive PubMed search of English-language articles pertaining to PCF and OCF in patients less than 18 years old. Of the 561 abstracts selected, 148 articles were reviewed, resulting in 60 articles that had sufficient detail to be included in the analysis. A meta-regression analysis was performed to determine if and how age, fusion technique, levels fused, fusion substrate, BMP use, postoperative bracing, and radiographic fusion criteria were related to the pooled prevalence estimates. A systematic review of the literature was performed according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. RESULTS A total of 604 patients met the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. The overall fusion rate was 93%, with a mean age of 9.3 years and mean follow-up of 38.7 months. A total of 539 patients had fusion with autograft (94% fusion rate) and 65 patients with allograft (80% fusion rate). Multivariate meta-regression analysis showed that higher fusion rates were associated with OCF compared with fusions that excluded the occiput (p < 0.001), with the use of auto graft instead of allograft (p < 0.001), and with the use of CT to define fusion instead of plain radiography alone. The type of internal fixation, the use of BMP, patient age, and the duration of follow-up were not found to be associated with fusion rates in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS Fusion rates for PCF are high, with higher rates of fusion seen when autograft is used as the bone substrate and when the occiput is included in the fusion construct. Further study of the use of allograft as a viable alternative to autograft bone fusion is warranted because limited data are available regarding the use of allograft in combination with more rigid internal fixation techniques and osteoinductive substances, both of which may enhance fusion rates with allograft.

Materials and Methods: A 3-dimensional BSSO model (10-mm advancement and setback) was constructed with Mimics. Bicortical screw fixation using Ti, IN, and Mg screws was performed with 4 different geometries of fixation. With an occlusal load of 132 N on the lower first molar, the von Mises stress (VMS) distribution was calculated using ANSYS. Results: The VMS distribution of Mg was more similar to that of Ti than to that of IN. In all cases, the highest VMS was concentrated on the screw at the most posterior and superior area. Stress was distributed mainly around the screw holes (cancellous bone) and the retromolar area (cortical bone). In the advancement surgery, fixation with 5 Mg screws (5A-Mg, 99.810 MPa at cortical bone) showed biomechanical stability, whereas fixation with the same number of IN screws did not (5A-IN, 109.021 MPa at cortical bone). In the setback surgery, although the maximum VMSs at cortical bone for Mg, IN, and Ti were lower than 108 MPa (yield strength of cortical bone), Mg screws showed more favorable results than IN screws because the maximum VMSs of Mg at cancellous bone were lower than those of IN. Conclusion: The Mg-based resorbable screw system is a promising alternative to the IN-based system.

Dedicated screws for compression osteosynthesis have been developed. However, due to the very limited size of the fractured bones and the considerable technical difficulties accompanying the execution of the fixation, there is little room for correction of the positioning and reinsertion of the screws. Therefore, knowing the optimal position of the fixation material is crucial for therapeutic success. The aim of this study is the evaluation of fixation screw position on the mandibular ramus height obtained in the treatment of the condylar head fracture. A total of 57 patients were included in this study. The loss of mandibular ramus height on computed tomography twelve months after mandibular head osteosynthesis was evaluated in relation to the initial distance of the screws from the fracture line, the angle of insertion of the screw into the bone, and the size of the protrusion to the inner side of the condyle. The relationship of the proximity of the screw to the fracture line, angulation, and the size of the protrusion with the loss of ramus height was confirmed. Conclusions: the optimal location for the superior screw is approx. 4 mm below the fracture line (with any angulation), inferior screw is approx. 8 mm (with any angulation), and anterior screw position is approx. 4-5 mm distant from fracture line with the best angulation of 130 degrees to the lateral mandible ramus surface in the coronal plane.

Mandibular fractures in these people range from 10.1% to 56%. Fragment reduction and fracture consolidation are difficult due to bone atrophy, decreased capacity for bone regeneration, and lack of anatomical landmarks to guide the alignment of the fragments. This study reports 2 patients with different conducts regarding the treatment of bilateral fractures in atrophic mandible. The first patient refers to the removal of plates of the 2.4 mm system with low profile, which failed during the mandibular function, being replaced by the 2.4 mm system with high profile. The 2nd clinical reports the use of the 2.0 mm system only to simplify the mandibular fracture, and then reconstructing that with a 2.4-mm system with high profile, using the load bearing principles. Regarding mandibular fractures, an important goal is to neutralize the muscle action aiming the bone stability. There are several methods to treat that the indication should consider the load bearing and load sharing concepts. The incorrect fixation choice in these patients can result in complications as bad union, material failure, infection, and consequent treatment failure.

We tried to evaluate the percutaneous hook reduction method and the transfacial Kirschner wire (K-wire) fixation method in these fractures' treatment. This study also analyses epidemiological data of 4 million inhabitants (Nord-Pas-de-Calais region) in this trauma type. Materials and Methods: All the ZMC fractures treated in our department from September 2000 to November 2006 were reviewed retrospectively. The patients were evaluated by clinical and radiologic assessment. Therapeutic data and results were analyzed. Results: We reviewed 216 consecutively isolated ZMC fractures managed in our unit: 39 women and 177 men were included (sex ratio, 1:4.5). Mean age is 33.1 years. Assault is the main etiology before motor vehicle crashes. The average treatment delay is 3.5 days, and the mean delay before surgery is 10.3 clays. All of the patients who had surgery underwent percutaneous hook reduction, and 77.3% of reduced fractures needed a contention realized at least by interosseous K-wire fixation in 94.6% of the cases. Reduction results were not satisfying in 5.6% of the patients who had surgery. Discussion: This Study aimed to evaluate a method of ZMC fractures treatment and to eventually modify some aspects. We proposed a guideline allowing a main importance to clinical examination and to interosseous transfacial K-wire fixation associated with an open reduction with frontozygomatic and/or infraorbital rim osteosynthesis if mandatory.

Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of multiple strains of the diazotrophic cyanobacterium, <i>Crocosphaera watsonii</i>, isolated from the open ocean	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							NORTH PACIFIC-OCEAN; PROCHLOROCOCCUS ECOTYPES; N-2 FIXATION; MARINE; GENOME; SYNECHOCOCCUS; TRICHODESMIUM; SEQUENCES; NITROGEN; ADAPTATION	Diazotrophic cyanobacteria have long been recognized as important sources of reduced nitrogen (N) and therefore are important ecosystem components. Until recently, species of the filamentous cyanobacterium Trichodesmium were thought to be the primary sources of fixed N to the open ocean euphotic zone. It is now recognized that unicellular cyanobacteria are also important contributors, with members of the oligotrophic genus Crocosphaera being the only cultured examples. Herein we genetically and phenotypically characterize 10 strains isolated from the tropical Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans, and show that although all of the strains are highly similar at the genetic level, with the internal transcribed sequence (ITS) region sequence varying by similar to 2 bp on average, there are many unexpected phenotypic differences between the isolates (e.g. cell size, temperature optima and range, extracellular material excretion and variability in rates of nitrogen fixation). However based on the observed sequence similarity, we propose that all of these isolates are members of the genus Crocosphaera (type strain Crocosphaera watsonii WH8501), and that the phenotypic diversity we see may reflect ecologically important variation relevant for modelling N-2 fixation in the oligotrophic ocean.

The conventional aqueous dyeing generates large quantities of wastewater containing high concentrations of salts and dyes and has very low dye-fixation. Substituted dyeing technologies not only failed to completely solve problems of aqueous dyeing but also generated new problems such as high cost for modifications of dyeing facilities and new environmental pollution. Using cottonseed oil as external dyeing phase notably increases the dye concentration in the internal solvent phase via raising the chemical potential of dyes at outer phase without the use of salts. The dye fixation based on the total dye added to the dyebath for CWDS increases by up to 30% compared to aqueous dyeing. Besides, the external phase in CWDS is recyclable and biodegradable. Furthermore, using CWDS, fabrics are dyed in current jet-dyeing facilities on a pilot scale and have the same levelness and colorfastness as those from aqueous dyeing. Dye fixation using pilot-scale jet dyeing machines in CWDS achieves 90%+. The materials and energy costs of CWDS are lower than those of aqueous dyeings. [GRAPHICS] .

Part two: Finite element analysis	JOURNAL OF CRANIO-MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article						Finite element analysis; Mandible; Sagittal split ramus osteotomy; Computer-aided design	RIGID INTERNAL-FIXATION; BIOMECHANICAL EVALUATION; MANDIBULAR ADVANCEMENT; SKELETAL STABILITY; SURGERY; STABILIZATION; SETBACK	Purpose: To evaluate three rigid, stable fixation methods for sagittal split ramus osteotomy (SSRO), using finite element analysis. The hypothesis is that a customized miniplate presents better stress concentration and distribution. Materials and methods: A 3D model of a hemimandible was created, and a 10-mm-advancement SSRO was simulated and fixed as follows: 3-DCP group - one custom miniplate fixed by eight screws; 4-H2P group - two miniplates of four holes each, fixed by eight screws; and 6-H2P group - two miniplates of six holes each fixed by 12 screws. After a vertical loading of 100 N, the values for von Mises stress, modified von Mises stress, and maximum and minimum principal stresses were measured. Results: The area of maximum principal stress was similar for the three groups - located in the upper miniplate, in the screw near the proximal segment osteotomy. The maximum von Mises stresses were 1580.4 MPa, 1005 MPa, and 977.56 MPa for the 3DCP, 4-H2P, and 6-H2P groups, respectively, showing an allowable displacement of 2.57 mm, 1.62 mm, and 1.52 mm for the 3DCP, 4-H2P, and 6-H2P groups, respectively. Conclusion: The customized miniplate did not present better stress distribution than two commonly used types of fixation. Fixation with two straight miniplates, either with four or six holes, offers adequate resistance for 10 mm linear advancements. (C) 2019 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.

Materials and Methods: Three-dimensional finite element models simulating Class III atrophic mandibular fractures were constructed. The models were divided into 4 groups according to plate thickness (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 mm). Fractures were simulated in left mandibular bodies, and 3 locking screws were used on each side of each fracture for fixation. Bite forces of approximately 63 N were simulated in the incisor and molar regions of the mandibles in finite element models. Results: The level of compressive strain on the bone around the screw was within the physiological limit. No significant difference was observed in the displacement of bone segments in the fracture region. Von Mises stress was higher during simulated bites in the molar region for plates with thicknesses of 1.0 mm. Plate tension values were below the level required for permanent deformation or fracture in all models. The 2.5-mm-thick plate presented better biomechanical performance than all other plates. The 2.0-mm-thick plate also showed satisfactory results and adequate safety limits. Conclusion: Large-profile (2.0-mm-thick) locking plates showed better biomechanical performance than did 1.0- and 1.5-mm-thick plates and can be considered an alternative reconstruction plate for the treatment of Class III atrophic mandibular fractures.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart analysis was performed, and data were limited to 1 operator. Treatment variables were methods of fixation, postoperative intermaxillary fixation (IMF), and retention versus extraction of teeth in the line of fracture. Outcomes were rates of postoperative infection, fracture healing, and overall patient comfort. Analysis was performed using the Fisher exact test, Wald test, and chi(2) test, with a P value less than .05 considered significant. Results: One hundred three patients were included in this study. The mean age was 30.4 years, most patients were men, and most injuries occurred during physical altercations and on the left side of the face. The most common concomitant fracture was of the contralateral parasymphysis. A statistically meaningful relation was noted between methods of fixation and healing and overall patient comfort, with the Champy technique and reconstruction plate being associated with the highest rates of bony union and patient comfort. No statistically relevant correlation was found between methods of fixation and rates of infection. There was no statistically relevant link for extraction versus retention of healthy teeth in the line of fracture or use of IMF with patient comfort, postoperative infection, or fracture healing. Conclusion: Although the Champy technique and reconstruction plates were associated with better postoperative outcomes, such as patient comfort and fracture healing, these should not be used interchangeably. IMF and extraction versus retention of teeth in the line of fracture did not influence any of the outcomes.

The purpose of this study is to comment on these topics. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis was done for patients with distal humeral coronal plane fractures. They were classified according to Dubberley and functionally evaluated by Mayo Elbow Performance Index (MEPI). The long-term complications were evaluated. Results: There were 15 patients, with type 1 fractures in 2, type 2 in 6, and type 3 in 7. All patients were treated by open reduction and internal fixation either by lateral or posterior approach. The average MEPI score was 83.3 (range, 60-100) points with 7 excellent, 2 good, and 6 fair results. The MEPI scores of type 3 fractures were significantly lower than those of types 1 and 2 fractures (P = .037 and P = .002, respectively). The complications were avascular necrosis in 4 (27%) patients, degenerative arthritis in 6 (40%), joint step-off in 6 (40%), heterotopic ossification in 7 (47%), nonunion in 1 (7%), and implant failure in 1 (7%). The presence of avascular necrosis and joint step-off were significantly associated with degenerative arthritis (P = .004 and P = .005, respectively). Heterotopic ossification was significantly associated with presence of lateral epicondyle fracture (P = .004). Conclusion: Type 1A and 2A coronal plane fractures typically had an excellent outcome. However, type 3 and subtype B fractures are prone to developing complications which are primarily avascular necrosis, degenerative arthritis and heterotopic ossification.

Orthopedic spinal and hip prostheses: Effects of magnetic susceptibility artifacts during MR arteriography and venography of abdomen and pelvis	RADIOLOGY			English	Article								Purpose: To retrospectively determine if susceptibility artifacts from internal metallic spinal fixation devices and hip prostheses limit the depiction of vascular anatomy and pathologic abnormalities during magnetic resonance (MR) arteriography and venography. Materials and Methods: This study was approved by the Committee on Human Research of the Institutional Review Board, which waived the requirement for informed consent and deemed the study to be HIPAA compliant. Forty-two contrast material-enhanced MR angiographic examinations were performed by using a 1.5-T imager in 41 patients (16 men, 25 women; mean age, 57 years; range, 36-79 years); 33 of these examinations included both MR arteriographic and MR venographic components. On the basis of resolution, images for which more than 3 mm of vessels were affected by susceptibility artifacts were considered uninterpretable. The odds of obtaining an uninterpretable image due to metallic artifacts were calculated, and a chi(2) analysis was employed to determine significance. Results: Total hip prostheses and spinal hardware that terminated above the L5 level did not generate any appreciable artifacts at MR arteriography (P < .001) or MR venography (P = .002). In patients with hardware that extended to the sacrum, 88% of MR arteriograms were of diagnostic quality (P = .001), but only 21% of MR venograms were interpretable (P = .004). Artifacts limited the evaluation of the inferior vena cava and common iliac veins near the confluence. Conclusion: Diagnostic-quality MR arteriograms and MR venograms can be obtained in patients with artificial hip prostheses and spinal hardware terminating above the L5 level, but there is 79% likelihood of obtaining a nondiagnostic MR venogram in patients with internal spinal fixation devices that extend to the sacrum.

However, the rate of femoral head necrosis remains high after FNF treatment. The study aimed to compare the biomechanical features of different internal fixation materials for the treatment of Pauwel type III FNF to explore new strategies for clinical management.MethodsA new material was prepared by applying casting, freeze drying and sintering process. The independently developed calcium magnesium silicate ceramic powder and hydrogel solution were evenly mixed to obtain a high-viscosity bio-ink, and a bioceramic nail (BN) with high mechanical strength and high fracture toughness was successfully prepared. Four internal fixations were developed to establish the Pauwel type III FNF and healed fracture finite element models: A, three CSs; B, three BNs; C, two BNs and one CS; D, one BN and two CSs. Von Mises stress and displacement of the implants and femur were observed.ResultsThe measured Mg content in ceramic powder was 2.08 wt%. The spectral data confirmed that the ceramic powder has high crystallinity, which coincides with the wollastonite-2 M (PDF# 27-0088). The maximum von Mises stresses for the four models were concentrated in the lower part of the fracture surface, at 318.42 Mpa, 103.52 MPa, 121.16 MPa, and 144.06 MPa in models A, B, C, and D, respectively. Moreover, the maximum Von-mises stresses of the implants of the four models were concentrated near the fracture end at 243.65 MPa (A) and 58.02 MPa (B), 102.18 MPa (C), and 144.06 MPa (D). The maximum displacements of the four models were 5.36 mm (A), 3.41 mm (B), 3.60 mm (C), and 3.71 mm (D). The displacements of the three models with BNs were similar and smaller than that of the triple CS fracture model. In the fracture healing models with and without three CSs, the greatest stress concentration was scattered among the lowest screw tail, femoral calcar region, and lateral femur shaft. The displacement and stress distributions in both models are generally consistent. The stress distribution and displacement of the three healed femoral models with BNs were essentially identical to the healing models with three CSs. The maximum von Mises stresses were 65.94 MPa (B), 64.61 MPa (C), and 66.99 MPa (D) while the maximum displacements of the three healed femoral models were 2.49 mm (B), 2.56 mm (C), and 2.49 mm (D), respectively.ConclusionsBioceramic nails offer greater advantages than conventional canulated screws after femoral neck fractures. However, the combination of bioceramic nails and CSs is more clinically realistic; replacing all internal fixations with bioceramic nails after the healing of femoral neck fractures can solve the problem of sclerosis formation around CSs and improve bone reconstruction by their bioactivity.

With rapid development of three-dimensional (3D) printing technology, new advances were made in these two aspects. In this study, digital image correlation method (DICM) data of the patient's ankle via computed tomography (CT) examination were obtained and imported into a series of software. The engineer cooperated with the surgeon to design the customized implants. Ti-6Al-4V spherical metal powder was chosen as raw material and fused together by selective electron beam melting (SEBM), a type of 3D printing technology, to prepare the implant. The implants were sterilized with ethylene oxide. The customized 3D-printed implants were successfully utilized in tibiotalocalcaneal (TTC) arthrodesis to maintain the bony structures at the functional position. In another case, the 3D-printed fusion cage was applied in subtalar arthrodesis to treat bone defects. In these clinical cases, 3D-printed customized titanium implants helped improve the surgical operation flow, and no obvious tissue reaction was observed. The successful implementation suggested that the application of 3D printing technology to prepare customized titanium implants would play an important role in future foot and ankle surgery.

Comparison of plating and intramedullary nailing	ACTA ORTHOPAEDICA BELGICA			English	Article						humerus shaft; bone nails; bone plates; intramedullary fracture fixation; open reduction internal fixation	DYNAMIC COMPRESSION PLATE; MANAGEMENT; ANTEGRADE	Plate and screw fixation (PSF) has always been the more common surgical treatment of humeral shaft fractures. However, intramedullary nailing (IMN) of the humerus has gained in popularity over the last two decades. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of plate fixation versus intramedullary nailing of midshaft humeral fractures. The study included 91 patients treated at the department of Trauma Surgery of the University hospital of Leuven; 42 fractures had been treated by plate fixation and 49 by IM nailing. Union, functional outcome, possible complications and the need for additional surgery were compared between the IMN and PSF group. No significant difference in terms of fracture union and functional recovery was noted between the two groups. There were four cases of postoperative radial nerve palsy in the PSF group, versus two in the IMN group (non significant difference). A significantly larger number of patients with restrictive pain and/or functional hindrance in the shoulder or elbow was noted in the IMN group (p = 0.0053). Problems with osteosynthesis material occurred as often in the PSF group as in the IMN group. One patient developed wound infection at the shoulder after antegrade nailing. A significantly larger number of complications was seen in the IMN group than in the PSF group (p = 0.05). A reoperation was necessary in 14.3% of the PSF patients and 163% of the IMN patients (non significant difference). In this retrospective study, IMN did not achieve better results than PSF of humeral midshaft fractures and was associated with more postoperative complications. Based on these findings, we suggest that plating of humeral shaft fractures should be considered as the primary treatment for all surgical indications, except for some open fractures requiring temporary external fixation, pathological fractures, humeral shaft fractures in morbidly obese and osteopenic patients, and large segmental fractures of the humerus.

Materials and Methods: Ten pairs or fibulas were osteotomied, plated (titanium plate with one lag screws. absorbable 2/8 plate-screws crossing vs. 0/8 plate-screws crossing the osteotomy gap). and tested in torsion and bending to obtain stiffness and neutral-zone (NZ) data. Tests were performed using 5 load cycles. No load to failure was performed. Biodegradation was simulated by 6 week immersion in phosphate-buffered saline after which the testing protocol was repeated. The specimens were then loaded with 100 N in bending. Results: Post-implantation, there were no significant differences, in torsion and bending, regarding the NZ or the stiffness, between the 2/8 biodegradable plate and the titanium plate. The 0/8 pattern performed significantly less well in terms or stiffness and NZ in the initial torsion test, and significantly less well in terms of stiffness in the initial bending test. After 6 week immersion, all biodegradable constructs showed a significantly larger NZ and significantly reduced bending and torsional stiffness. When loaded with 100 N, four of the six 0/8 osteosyntheses railed. There were no significant differences between the 2/8 pattern and the titanium plates. Conclusion: In a model of a Weber-B fracture, the use of a 2/8 biodegradable plate construct initially did not differ statistically to that obtained with a one-third tubular titanium plate. After immersion the 2/8 construct withstood some physiological load.

Microspheres as building blocks for hydroxyapatite/polylactide biodegradable composites	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Workshop on Interfaces	JUN 26-30, 2005	Univ Santiago, Santiago de Compostela, SPAIN		Univ Santiago		MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; BONE; FRACTURES; CARRIERS	A new generation of organic/inorganic composites is offering a promising approach for creating biocompatible and biodegradable materials with mechanical properties that match that of human bone better than traditional metallic implants. Here, we report a novel technique whereby hydroxyapatite powder is encapsulated in polylactide-based microspheres, processed by an emulsion-solvent evaporation method, and then used as the building blocks to produce dense, microstructurally-uniform composites through a hot pressing route. The mechanical properties of these composites--both ab initio and after in vitro degradation in a simulated environment- were subsequently characterized. Although despite in vitro degradation remains an issue, the Young's modulus, bending strength and fracture resistance were higher than the corresponding minimum values for human cortical bone. These results suggest that the hot-pressing of hydroxyapatite/polylactide microspheres can be a viable route for the synthesis of load-bearing bone-replacement materials.

Methods First, pelvic CT images were generated from a healthy volunteer, and multislice sagittal views were produced to determine the axis for the first sacral vertebra geometric osseous fixation pathway (GOFP). Subsequently, according to the geometric size and mechanical parameters of the iliosacral screw, the screw models with the same diameter of 7.3 mm and different lengths of 80 mm, 90 mm, 100 mm, 110 mm, 120 mm, 130 mm and 140 mm were built. Then the seven screws were assembled with the pelvic model. The maximum von Mises stress and the shape variables were evaluated for the pelvis and the screws. Results Results are shown for the pelvic and GOFP screw, respectively. The simulation results show that the maximum von Mises stress in the cortex of the pelvic ring of the pelvis with the 130-mm length screw is the lowest among the pelvic models with different screws. Moreover, the peak displacement of the pelvis with the 130-mm length screw is the smallest. These results indicate that under the standing condition, a 130-mm length screw can decrease the stress concentration and result in a more effective transfer of stress within the reconstructed pelvis. In addition, the displacement of the screw with a 130-mm length is the smallest among all the considered screws. The peak von Mises stresses in the 130-mm length screw and the cortex are still within a low and elastic range below the yielding strengths of the materials. Conclusion Through the finite element analysis, the GOFP can be used as a safe and effective way for iliosacral screw fixation. The optimal length of the screw may be 130 mm length.

The as-prepared binary or ternary composites were degraded in vitro in PBS solution with a pH value of 7.4 at 37.5 degrees C. The variations in mass, pH value, surface morphology, crystallization performance, melting behavior, and mechanical properties of the samples during the degradation course were systemically considered. The results revealed that the g-MgOs accelerated the early degradation of the composite, while the g-CHNs played a regulatory role in the later degradation of the composite. Simultaneously adding g-MgOs and g-CHNs can maintain the mechanical properties of the composite at an early stage but promote the degradation of the composite at a later stage, which suggests that the degradation behavior of the PLLA matrix could be regulated to some extent. This tunable degradation behavior of the g-MgOs/g-CHNs/PLLA composite is conducive to its application as a bone internal fixation implant.

Materials and methods: Four aluminum hemimandibles with linear sectioning simulating a mandibular body fracture were used as the substrates and were fixed using the two techniques and two different brands of fixation plate. These were divided into four groups: groups I and II were fixed with one four-hole plate, with four 6 mm screws in the tension zone and one four-hole plate, with four 10 mm screws in the compression zone; and groups III and IV were fixed with one four-hole plate with four 6 mm screws in the neutral zone. Fixation plates manufactured by Toride were used for groups I and III, and by Traumec for groups II and IV. The hemimandibles were submitted to vertical, linear load testing in an Instron 4411 servohydraulic mechanical testing unit, and the load/displacement (3 mm, 5 mm and 7 mm) and the peak loads were measured. Means and standard deviations were evaluated applying variance analysis with a significance level of 5%. Results: The only significant difference between the brands was seen at displacements of 7 mm. Comparing the techniques, groups I and II showed higher mechanical strength than groups III and IV, as expected. Conclusion: For the treatment of mandibular linear body fracture, two locking plates, one in the tension zone and another in the compression zone, have a greater mechanical strength than a single locking plate in the neutral zone.

Ten plates were developed in Y shape, containing eight holes, and 30 synthetic polyurethane mandible replicas were developed for the study. Material and methods: The load test was performed on an Instron Model 4411 universal testing machine, applying load in the mediolateral and anterior-posterior positions on the head of the condyle. Two-way ANOVA with Tukey testing with a 5% significance level was used. Results: It was observed that when the load was applied in the medial-lateral plate of greater thickness (1.5 mm), it gave the highest strength, while in the anteroposterior direction, the plate with the highest resistance was of the lesser thickness (0.6 mm). A plate with a thickness of 1.5 mm was the one with the highest average value for all displacements. In the anteroposterior direction, the highest values of resistance were seen in the displacement of 15 mm. Conclusion: After comparing the values of the biomechanical testing found in the scientific literature, it is suggested that the use of Y plates are suitable for use in subcondylar fractures within the limitations of the study.

Although cut-outs are common to both intra- and extramedullary fixation, especially in unstable pertrochanteric hip fractures, FNE medial migration in sliding hip screws continues to remain sparse despite increased awareness of the phenomenon. This study aims to investigate whether intramedullary nailing is biomechanically predisposed to FNE medial migration compared to extramedullary fixation with sliding hip screws to account for the discrepancy in reported FNE medial migration rates. Materials and methods: Twelve fourth-generation synthetic femurs (Sawbones) with unstable intertrochanteric fractures were divided into 2 groups (n=6 per group). Fracture fixation was performed using the Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA, Synthes) (n= 6) in the first group, and the Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS, Synthes) (n=6) in the second group. Both groups were subjected to bidirectional cyclic loading (600N compression loading, 120N tensile loading) at 2 Hz for 5000 cycles. The medial migration distance (MMD) was recorded at the end of the testing cycles. Results: The mean MMD in the PFNA group was 4.56mm (SD 0.69mm) with consistent reproduction of medial migration across all constructs tested. This was significantly more compared to the MMD of 1.17mm (SD 0.69mm) in the DHS group (p<0.001). Conclusion: Intramedullary nailing of unstable intertrochanteric hip fractures is inherently predisposed to FNE medial migration making it more susceptible to consequent cut-out compared to fixation with the DHS.

The advantages of titanium include decreased implant stiffness, increased biocompatibility, and diminished stress shielding. However, titanium has been implicated in tendon irritation and adhesions when used in the hand and wrist. We evaluated the relationship between extensor tendon morphology and dorsal plating of the distal radius in a canine model using distal radius pi plates made of stainless steel, titanium, and titanium alloy with a modified ramped edge design. We found marked histologic changes in the tendons and surrounding soft tissues including tendon deformation and degeneration (fibrillation, cartilage metaplasia, hypocellularity and hyalinization of blood vessels), peritendonous adhesions and neovascularity in the parenchyma. Only a minimal inflammatory cell infiltrate was identified and was limited to the tenosynovium and/or paratenon. No differences were identified between titanium and stainless steel implants and those with a ramped design. Although all animals lost wrist motion with time, no differences were observed between groups. Our results suggest that pi plate placement on the dorsal surface of the distal radius may lead to extensor tendon irritation and dysfunction. There is no evidence to suggest that this is specifically related to titanium or plate edge design.

Incidence of Pulmonary Embolism Following Surgical Treatment of Metatarsal Fractures	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Metatarsal Fracture; Pulmonary Embolism; Thromboembolic Disease	ANKLE SURGERY; FOOT; THROMBOPROPHYLAXIS	Background: The purpose of this study was to identify the rates of readmission to the hospital for pulmonary embolism following open reduction and internal fixation of metatarsal fractures using observational, population-based data from all inpatient admissions in California over an 11-year period. Materials and Methods: We identified patients undergoing open reduction and internal fixation of a metatarsal fracture in the years 1995 to 2005 as inpatients using California's discharge database. The outcomes analyzed included readmission within 90 days of surgery for pulmonary embolism. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the impact of patient factors such as age, race/ethnicity and gender in predicting the rates of thromboembolic disease. Results: A total of 1,477 metatarsal ORIF procedures were performed as inpatients during the study period. We identified four patients (0.27%) readmitted with pulmonary embolism within 90 days of their initial ORIF procedure. There were three (0.20%) cases of mortality, none of which occurred in the four patients readmitted with pulmonary embolism. Given the low incidence, we did not identify age, gender, or race/ethnicity as statistically significant predictors of a higher risk of thromboembolic disease. Conclusion: The rate of readmission for pulmonary embolism was low. This suggests that the routine use of thromboprophylaxis may not be necessary for isolated metatarsal fractures to prevent pulmonary embolism.

There has been an increasing use of locked volar plate fixations which report satisfactory results. However, some authors advocate the use of nail fixation. Hypothesis: The aim of this study is to compare dorsal nail plate versus locked volar plate fixation in the treatment of distal radius fractures with dorsal tilt. Materials and methods: The mean age of the patients was over 50 years. The study included extra-articular distal radius fractures with posterior tilt. We conducted a prospective randomized study between December 2007 and February 2009 including a group of 16 patients treated with a dorsal nail fixation (group 1) and a group of 15 patients managed with a locked volar plate fixation (group II). We analyzed both the clinical results (complications, Range of motion [ROM], tightening strength, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand [DASH] and Mayo Clinic scores) and the radiographic results from A/P and lateral radiographs in the early postoperative period and at 6-month follow-up. Results: ROM toward extension was better in the volar plating subgroup (group I, 42.5 degrees, group II, 57.5 degrees; P < 0.05). Pronation mobility was better in the dorsal nail subgroup (group I, 85 degrees; group II, 80 degrees; P < 0.05). The locked volar plate fixation subgroup demonstrated a better recovery of the tightening strength as compared with the uninjured side (group I, 78%, group II, 90%, P = 0.03). The DASH score was similar in both groups (group I, 22.09 +/- 22.9; group II, 20.62 +/- 20.3, P > 0.05). The Mayo Clinic score was better in the locked volar plate fixation subgroup (group I, 65 +/- 13.4; group II, 85.6 +/- 19.2; P = 0.002). Radiographic results were good in both groups, however anatomical reduction of the volar tilt was significantly better in group II (plate) when compared with the uninjured side. Moreover, we report on two cases of tendinous damages to the long extensor muscle of the thumb in the dorsal nail fixation subgroup despite the use of a minimally invasive implant. Conclusion: The management of distal radius fractures with locked volar plate fixation in active elderly patients has proved successful and leads to better results than nail fixation regarding both reduction quality and objective functional scores.

Fixation of distal femoral fractures in osteoporotic bone with short segment remains a challenge, especially after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Internal fixation of these fractures using locking plates has become popular. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a consecutive series of periprosthetic supracondylar femoral fractures treated with locked periarticular plate fixation with regard to surgical procedure, complications and clinical outcome. Materials and methods: From two academic trauma centres, 55 consecutive periprosthetic distal femoral fractures (Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen/Orthopaedic Trauma Association, AO/OTA 33) were retrospectively identified as having been treated with locked plate fixation. Of these, 36 fractures in 35 patients (86.1% female) met the inclusion criteria. Patients had an average age of 73.2 years (range 54-95 years). Fixation constructs for plate length and working length were delineated. Nonunion, infection and implant failure were used as complication variables. Demographics were assessed. Outcome was addressed radiographically and clinically according to Kristensen et al.(1) by range of motion and pain. Results: Twenty-five of 36 fractures (69.4%) healed after the index procedure. Eight of 36 fractures (22.2%) developed a nonunion with three fractures (8.3%) leading to hardware failure. Nine of the 36 patients (25%) were radiographically diagnosed with notching of the anterior femoral cortex. Regarding technical aspects, distance from the anterior flange of the femoral component to fracture was significantly shorter in patients with compared to without anterior notching (t = 3.68, p = 0.02). Patients who underwent submuscular plate insertion compared to an extensive lateral approach had a reduced nonunion risk (chi(2) = 0.05). No difference in infection rate was found for submuscular procedures compared with open procedures (chi(2) = 0.85). Range of motion was reduced in most of the patients and 13.5% had a persistent loss of extension of 5 degrees. More than 77% of the patients reported no or only mild pain during the last office visit. Range of motion loss did not influence pain. Successful treatment according to Cain et al.(2) was achieved in 83%. Using Kristensen's(1) criteria, 56% of the knees had acceptable flexion. Conclusion: Operative fixation of periprosthetic distal femoral fractures after TKA continues to be challenging. Notching of the anterior femoral cortex should be avoided. Loss of reduction and high failure rates still occur with locked plating and may be related to underlying factors. Indirect reduction and submuscular plate insertion technique reduce nonunion risk.

J	Kong, LP; Wang, Y; Lu, QS; Han, Y; Wang, F				Kong, Lingpeng; Wang, Yan; Lu, Qingsen; Han, Yong; Wang, Fu			Biomechanical properties of a novel fixation system for intra-articular distal humerus fractures: a finite element analysis	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND RESEARCH			English	Article						Distal humeral fracture; Capitellum; Trochlea; Biomechanics; Finite element analysis; Internal fixation	INTERCONDYLAR FRACTURES; PLATE FIXATION; OPERATIVE TREATMENT; MANAGEMENT; CAPITELLAR	Background The traditional strategy for fixing intra-articular distal humerus fractures is double plating placed in an orthogonal configuration, based on posterior approach. With a combined medial and lateral approach, a novel configuration of plating (combined anteromedial and anterolateral plating) has been used. In this study, we investigated the biomechanical properties of the novel plating by comparing it with some traditional strategies. Methods Based on the 3D morphology of a healthy subject's humerus, models of three types of intra-articular distal humeral fractures were established using a variety of different internal fixation methods: (a) treatment of a simple intra-articular fracture of the distal humerus with the novel double plate and a traditional orthogonal plate; (b) treatment of a comminuted fracture of the lower distal humerus with the novel double plate, a traditional orthogonal plate and a traditional orthogonal plate combined with distally extended tension screws; (c) treatment of a coronal shear fracture of the distal humerus with the novel double plate, a traditional orthogonal plate and the intra-articular placement of three screws. The material properties of all plates and screws were isotropic and linearly elastic. The Poisson ratio of the implant and bone was 0.3, and the elastic modulus of the implant was 114,000 MPa. The axial loading is 200 N, the bending loading is 30 N and varus rotation is 7.5 Nm in the longitudinal direction. Results A simple model of intra-articular fracture of the distal humerus (AO C1 type) was established. Under all experimental conditions, the novel double plate showed greater stiffness than the orthogonal double plate. The axial straightening, bending compression and varus torsion increased by 18.00%, 16.00% and 44.00%, respectively. In the model of comminuted fracture of the lower distal humerus, the novel double plate showed the best stiffness under three experimental conditions (163.93 N/mm, 37.97 N/mm, 2697.84 N mm/degrees), and the stiffness of the traditional orthogonal plate combined with the distally extended tension screws was similar to that of the traditional orthogonal plate (121.21 N/mm, 32.61 N/mm, 1968.50 N mm/degrees). In the model of coronal shear fracture of the distal humerus, the novel double plate showed the best stiffness under all test conditions (194.17 N/mm, 38.46 N/mm, 2929.69 N mm/degrees), followed by the traditional plate (153.85 N/mm, 33.33 N/mm, 2650.18 N mm/degrees), while the stiffness of the three screws was the smallest (115.61 N/mm, 28.30 N/mm, 2180.23 N mm/degrees). Conclusions In terms of biomechanics, compared with other internal fixation methods, the novel combined anteromedial and anterolateral anatomical locking double-plate showed less stress, less displacement and greater stiffness. The novel double-plate method can be used to treat not only simple intra-articular fractures of the humerus but also complex comminuted fractures of the lower distal humerus and coronal shear fractures of the distal humerus, with a better effect than current traditional internal fixation methods.

Materials and methods: This study included 22 patients who were undergone proximal IM nailing with lesser trochanter wiring between January 2014 to June 2015. All patients were treated with minimally invasive technique of candy-package wiring for lesser trochanter fragments. The mean age was 75.8 years (range, 53-88) and average follow-up period was 15.1 months (range, 12-24). Each patient was followed up for a minimum of 12 months and their clinical and radiological results were analyzed. Results: The mean period required for fracture union was 16.6 weeks. (range, 8-25) and union was successfully completed in all cases. The WOMAC scores at the last F/U visit ( average; 45.4, range; 21- 75) were not significantly different to pre-trauma status (average; 36.5, range; 19-59) (p = 0.087). In comparison of ambulatory capacity prior to trauma, ambulatory aggravation was noted in four cases (18.2%), and eighteen cases (81.8%) was sustained walking ability of prior of trauma. Wiring breakage was found in two cases and heterotrophic ossification in one case. There were no functional deficeit related to the radiologic finding in these patients. With regard to postoperative complications, were no cut-outs, breakage, or pullout of screws. Conclusion: When surgically repairing unstable intertrochanteric fractures with lesser trochanter comminution using proximal IM nailing method, the modified Candy-packaging wiring technique increases the fixation force at the fracture site. Thus, through this technique, both firm fixation of the lesser trochanter and more stable bony union were obtained. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Only few trials have studied results following angular stable plate fixation. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical, radiological, functional and quality of life results following tibial plateau fractures using angular stable plate fixation. Materials and Methods: 101 patients were retrospectively studied using functional (ROM; KSS; VAS), radiographic (osteoarthritis score, loss of reduction) and quality of life (WOMAC; Lysholm) scores. There were 46 males and 55 females. The average of patients was 51 years (range 22-77 years). Study groups were assigned according to the AO fracture classification. Results: Mean followup was 57 +/- 30 months. Fracture type distribution revealed a significantly (P < 0.001) increased number of type B- (62.4%) compared to C-fractures. Functional assessment showed a significantly better total KSS (84.1 +/- 15.6 vs. 74.7 +/- 18.0; P = 0.01) as well as ROM (active: 124 degrees +/- 17 degrees vs. 116 degrees +/- 15 degrees, P = 0.014; passive: 126 degrees +/- 18 degrees vs. 118 +/- 14 degrees, P = 0.017) in the B-fracture group. VAS was found to be markedly higher (P = 0.0039) following type C-fractures. Rating osteoarthritis secondary to a tibial plateau fracture as a function of injury severity (r = 0.485; P < 0.001) and relating the loss of reduction to the grade of evolving osteoarthritis (r = 0.643; P < 0.001) a positive correlation was found. Quality of life showed significantly improved results for Lysholm score (P = 0.004) following B-fractures with low overall values for the WOMAC score. Conclusion: Presented data provide sufficient evidence that anatomic restoration of tibial plateau fractures with angular stable plate fixation result in decreased loss of reduction and declined incidence of posttraumatic osteoarthritis, thereby providing acceptable mid to long term outcome.

Clinical outcome of conventional versus biological fixation of subtrochanteric fractures by proximal femoral locked plate	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Subtrochanteric fractures; Proximal femoral plate; PF-LCP; Patient compliance	LOCKING COMPRESSION PLATE; HIP SCREW; INTERTROCHANTERIC FRACTURES; FEMUR FRACTURES; BLADE-PLATE; FAILURE; REDUCTION	Introduction: Surgical fixation is the standard management of the subtrochanteric fractures. Proximal femoral locked plating (PF-LCP) provides a strong construct for fixation with a high success rate. However, some studies reported implant failure due to loss of the postero-medial bone support and recommended an anatomical reduction. Other studies reported excellent to good results with indirect (biological) fixation without anatomical reduction. In this study, we reviewed the short-term clinical results of PF-LCP fixation for subtrochanteric fractures using both conventional and biological fixation. Materials and methods: Forty six patients (34 males and 12 females) with comminuted subtrochanteric fractures were included aged between 18 and 74 (mean 44.3 years). They were treated in a single-blind random manner by either conventional (open, direct) or biological (indirect) reduction method and internal fixation with PF-LCP. Intra-operative variables including; duration of surgery, blood loss, fluoroscopy time and any complications were recorded. Post-operative differences including; duration of healing, implant failure, complications and the final clinical outcome by Harris Hip Score (HHS) were documented. Results: 44 cases continued to the final follow-up (23 of the open fixation group and 21 of the biological fixation group). Patients of open group demonstrated greater blood loss (756 +/- 151 vs. 260 +/- 39 ml; P < 0.0001), longer operative times (129 +/- 16.9 vs. 91 +/- 8 min; P < 0.0001) and incisions (s) length (20.4 +/- 3 vs. 13.4 +/- 1 cm; P < 0.0001). More patients needed blood transfusion in open group (11 patients vs. six in closed group; P < 0.0001). Patients of biological group demonstrated longer fluoroscopy time (80.9 +/- 7.3 vs. 47.2 +/- 5.8 sec.; P < 0.0001). For each group, one case of implant failure was recorded. Low patient compliance was a detrimental factor for the implant failure in both cases. No much difference was demonstrated for the healing rate (open group; 18.3 +/- 3.7 vs. biological group 16.5 +/- 4 weeks; P < 0.058) and for the functional outcome (open group; excellent/good: 54%/37%, biological group; excellent/good: 57%/33%; P = 0.766). Conclusion: PF-LCP provided a strong construct for fixation of the comminuted subtrochanteric fractures either by open or biological techniques. Low patient compliance is an influential factor for implant failure in both types. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Su, YX; Nan, GX				Su, Yuxi; Nan, Guoxin			Treatment of medial humeral epicondyle fractures in children using absorbable self-reinforced polylactide pins	MEDICINE			English	Article						absorbable self-reinforced polylactide pin; fracture; medial epicondyle humerus; pediatric	INTERNAL-FIXATION; SCREW FIXATION; SEPARATION; PLATE	The best treatment for medial humeral epicondyle fractures in children has been debated. In case of incarceration of the epicondylar fragment, particularly after elbow dislocation, several materials are used for fixation, including Kirschner wires (K-wires), metallic compression screws, tension band wire, and suture anchors. Herein, we introduce a new fixation material: the absorbable self-reinforced polylactide (SR-PLA) pin. The aim of the study was to prove the feasibility of a new fixation material (absorbable SR-PLA pins) for the treatment of medial epicondyle fracture in children. Thirty-two patients who underwent surgery in our hospital from August 2007 to January 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into group A (K-wires) and group B (absorbable SR-PLA pin). Group A comprised 11 males and 4 females, aged 8 to 14 years (average, 12.6 years), with 12 patients with elbow dislocation. Group B comprised 13 males and 4 females, aged 7 to 15 years (average, 11.8 years), with 13 patients with elbow dislocation. The same approach was used for all patients by the same team of surgeons, and all the patients were followed up for over 12 months. In all patients, rehabilitation training was started after 3 weeks. The Broberg and Morrey elbow scale was used to evaluate elbow function at follow-up. Four patients from group A developed pin-track infections that gradually resolved after removal of the K-wires, whereas no infections occurred in group B. One patient refractured her humerus after K-wire removal. Using the Broberg and Morrey elbow scale, outcomes in group A were classified as excellent in 5 patients (33.33%), good in 7 patients (46.67%), fair in 2 patients (13.33%), and poor in 1 (0.07%). Group B outcomes were scored as excellent in 12 patients (70.58%), good in 4 (23.53%), and fair in 1 (0.06%) and no patient (0.00%) had a poor outcome. The average Broberg and Morrey score for group A was significantly lower than that for group B (83.27 +/- 7.02 vs 95.21 +/- 5.04;P = .0238). Absorbable SR-PLA pins can be safely used for medial epicondyle fractures in children. Our results indicate that SR-PLA pins are associated with better short-term functional outcome than K-wires.

The Femoral Neck System (FNS) was recently introduced for the fixation of femur neck fractures. Although neck shortening was reduced with the FNS, the complication rates were not reduced. Thus, improvements to enhance fixation stability should be made for the FNS. We hypothesized that (1) the pre-sliding technique and (2) the use of longer anti-rotation screw would increase fracture stability. This study aimed to determine the change in fracture stability using the pre-sliding technique and long anti-rotation screw in the FNS for fixation of Pauwels type III femoral neck fractures.MethodsFinite element models of Pauwels type III femoral neck fracture fixed with pre-sliding FNS and 5-mm longer anti-rotation screw were established. The models were subjected to normal walking load. The material properties of the elements belonging to the bone were mapped by assigning the formulation with the computed tomography Hounsfield unit.ResultsPauwels type III femoral neck fractures fixed with pre-slided FNS showed better fracture stability, decreasing fracture gap and sliding by 14% and 12%, respectively, under normal walking load. No element of cortical bone in any of the models had an absolute value of principal strain that exceeded 1%. The peak von Mises stress (VMS) of the implants ranged from 260 to 289 MPa, and the highest peak VMS value was 50% lower than the yield strength of the titanium alloy (800 MPa). The longer anti-rotation screw did not affect fracture stability.ConclusionsThe pre-sliding technique using the FNS showed higher fracture stability than the standard fixation technique for a Pauwels type III femoral neck fracture. The longer anti-rotation screw did not contribute significantly to fixation stability. As this finite element analysis considered the inhomogeneous mechanical property of the bone, it offered equivalent mechanical conditions to investigate the components of interest.

Multiple Reaction Monitoring Assay for Pre-eclampsia Related Calcyclin Peptides in Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded Placenta	JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH			English	Article						calcyclin; multireaction monitoring; formalin-fiiced paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue; placenta	OXIDATIVE STRESS; PROTEOMIC ANALYSIS; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; S100A6 EXPRESSION; PROTEINS	Although the cause of pre-eclampsia during pregnancy has not been elucidated yet, it is evident that placental and maternal endothelial dysfunction is involved. We previously demonstrated that in early onset pre-eclampsia placental calcyclin (S100A6) expression is significantly higher compared to controls (De Groot, C.J.; et al. Clin. Proteomics 2007, 1, 325). In the current study, the results were confirmed and relatively quantified by using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) on two peptide fragments of calcyclin. Cells were obtained from control (n = 5) and pre-eclamptic placental (n = 5) tissue collected by laser capture microdissection from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) material treated with a solution to reverse formalin fixation. Two calcyclin peptides with an extra glycine inserted in the middle of the amino acid sequence were synthesized and used as an internal reference. Data presented show that MRM on laser microdissected material from FFPE tissue material is possible. The developed MRM assay to study quantitative levels of proteins in FFPE laser microdissected cells using nonisotopic-labeled chemical analogs of mass tagged internal references showed that in pre-eclamptic patients elevated levels of calcyclin is observed in placental trophoblast cells compared to normal trophoblast cells. By immunohistochemistry, we were able to confirm this observation in a qualitative manner.

Materials and Methods: Twenty-eight zygomatic bones of edentulous maxillae from cadavers were used. The mean age of cadaver specimens was 79.6 years. The specimens were analyzed using micro-computed tomography. Results: The internal structure of edentulous maxillae had thicker trabeculae in the region at the tip of the zygomaticus fixture than in other regions. Conclusions: The present findings suggest that the presence of wider and thicker trabeculae at the end of the fixture promotes initial fixation. Also, when the trabeculae are able to support occlusal force after successful osseointegration, this thickening greatly aids the support of the fixture at the tip of the fixture, where stress is thought to be concentrated. In addition, the occlusal force was applied to the entire zygomatic bone. This preliminary study suggests that better understanding of the internal structure of the zygomatic bone will provide further information about the direction of installation of the zygomatic fixture, the ideal position of the zygomatic fixture, and the prognosis of implant therapy.

This study aims to investigate the modification effect of titanium compounds on polypropylene materials and compare the performance of two kinds of meshes both in vivo and in vitro.Methods: Human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HMrSV5), human epidermal fibroblasts (HSF), and human monocytic cells (THP-1) were cultured in vitro to simulate the abdominal external hernia environment. Titanized polypropylene meshes (Ti) and polypropylene mesh (Non-Ti) were co-cultured with the cells respectively. The effects of titanium compounds on cell growth were determined by cell activity and apoptosis, and the growth of cells on the mesh surface was assessed using a scanning electron microscope and a confocal microscope. In vivo experiments, different sizes titanized polypropylene meshes and polypropylene meshes were placed between the external oblique abdominal muscle and the internal oblique abdominal muscle, the parietal peritoneum, the serous layer of the descending colon, and the underside of the femoral nerve in rabbits. The effects of titanium compounds were evaluated by observing the anti-adhesion, anti-contraction, anti-fibrotic properties, and effects on nerves of the mesh.Results: Titanium compounds effectively reduced the effects of polypropylene material on cell growth, and improved the fixation and adhesion of HMrSV5, HSF and THP-1 (M0) on the surface of titanized polypropylene meshes. Furthermore, titanium compounds improved the adhesion, contraction and fibrosis of polypropylene material, as well as reduced nerve damage. This improvement demonstrated a regular trend with the type of titanized polypropylene meshes.Conclusion: The titanium compounds improved the biocompatibility of the polypropylene material, which was conducive to the fixation and adhesion of cells on the surface of the meshes, and alleviated the adhesion and contraction of the meshes, and the degree of tissue fibrosis, as well as the influence on nerves.

This study was set up to identify the role of open reduction and internal fixation of acetabular fractures in persons of old age. We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts and radiological data of all patients older than 65 years, who suffered an isolated acetabular fracture and were admitted in our Department between 2010 and 2014 (5-year period). Complications, outcome and mortality were recorded. Of all surviving patients, quality of life (QoL), mobility and independence were graded with European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 3 Level (EQ-5D-3L), European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-5D-VAS), Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Elderly Mobility Scale (EMS) and Tinetti Mobility Test (TMT). Results Seventy patients could be identified. There were 52 men (74%) and 18 women (26%) with a median age of 79.0 years (range: 65-104 years). Forty-six patients (66%) had been treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), 24 (34%) conservatively. There were negative predictive factors-subchondral impaction, damage to the femoral head and multiple fragments-in 54% of the operative group. With ORIF, an anatomical reduction could be achieved in 27 patients (59%), an acceptable in 18 (39%) and a poor in one (2%). At follow-up, 18 patients (26%) had died and 23 (33%) were not able to participate. The follow-up rate of the surviving operatively treated patients was 77%. Eleven of 46 operated patients (24%) needed a conversion to a total hip arthroplasty (THA). All patients undergoing conversion had imperfect reduction after surgery. No patient in the non-operative group underwent conversion to THA during follow-up. The median follow-up time of operatively treated patients without conversion (n = 17) was 30 months (range, 16-73 months), of patients with THA (n = 9) 30 months after conversion (range, 17-55 months). Quality of reduction correlated to QoL, mobility and independence in all recorded parameters. Patients with secondary THA had similar good outcomes as patients after ORIF without later conversion. Men had better outcome than women. Conclusion ORIF of acetabular fractures in patients of old age results in excellent outcomes at short-term follow-up when anatomical reduction can be achieved. In case of negative predictive factors, ORIF cannot be regarded as a definitive solution, rather as the construction of a stable socket for secondary THA. The decision of therapy should be made dependent on pre-operative radiographic parameters.

J	Babhulkar, S; Babhulkar, S				Babhulkar, Sudhir; Babhulkar, Sushrut			Controversies in the management of intra-articular fractures of distal humerus in adults	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Distal humerus; intra-articular fracture; olecranon osteotomy; plate fixation; tension band wire	BIOMECHANICAL EVALUATION; SUPRACONDYLAR FRACTURES; OLECRANON OSTEOTOMY; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; INTERNAL-FIXATION; NON-UNION; ELBOW; END	Background: The surgical approach, type of olecranon osteotomy, method of stabilization of osteotomy, type of fracture stabilization, orthogonal vs parallel plate fixation, need for transposition of ulnar nerve, place for primary total elbow replacement, and type of rehabilitation schedule after surgical fracture treatment are the controversial issues in the treatment of complex intra-articular distal humerus fractures (C2 and C3) in adults. Severe comminution, bone loss, and osteoporosis at the site of distal articular fractures of humerus often lead to unsatisfactory results due to inadequate fixation. We hereby report the outcome of a series of intracondylar fractures of the humerus treated by open reduction and internal fixation and discuss the controversies in light of published literature. Materials and Methods: One hundred and eighty-four patients of intra-articular fractures of distal humerus (C2 and C3) were operated by posterior transolecranon approach between January 1980 and December 2008. Initially, in the first part Chevron intra-articular osteotomy (n=108) was performed out of which 94 have been published in another publication. In later second part (1993 onward), extra-articular olecranon osteotomy (n=76) was routinely performed. Both columns were stably fixed by orthogonal methods; (n=174) however, during the last 2 years, in 10 patients with severe comminution with bone loss, stabilization was achieved by parallel plating. The osteotomy was routinely stabilized by tension band wiring with two parallel K-wires introduced up to the anterior ulnar cortex. The results were evaluated by the staging system of Caja et al. at a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Results: In the first part of the study (n=94), there was delayed union in 4% (n=4), with the fracture taking more than 20 weeks for union. There was delayed union of ulnar osteotomy (n=3) and failure of one tension band wiring, requiring revision. Some loss of motion was seen in 20% of cases and these patients did not achieve full flexion and extension. However, all these patients had useful range of function, with 20 degrees-110 degrees of flexion and full pronation-supination. As per the staging system of Caja et al., the results were in the range of excellent to good in 72% cases (n=67), fair in 19% (n=18), and poor in 9% patients (n=9). In the second part of study (n=90) dual plate fixation of both columns by orthogonal methods (n=80) and parallel plate fixation in 10 patients was performed. The results were excellent to good in 78 patients (86%). Conclusions: The high rate of union can be achieved in complex intra-articular fractures of distal humerus if the proper principles of stable fracture fixation are followed, i.e., a posterior transolecranon approach and dual fixation of both columns and restoration of the continuity of articular surface. The stability achieved by this technique permits institution of early intensive physiotherapy to restore elbow function.

However, short-comings such as insufficient mechanical strength, inappropriate degradation time, lack of radiolucency, and foreign body reactions during bone remodeling remain. Material and methods: In this study, calcium phosphate ceramic (CPC, including tricalcium phosphate [TCP] and tetracalcium phosphate/dicalcium phosphate [TTCP/DCP]) and poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) were used to fabricate biodegradable orthopedic fixation devices. Results: Different weight ratios of CPC were added to PCL, and the results showed that the PCL/CPC composites had good radiopacity, mechanical properties, and biocompatibility. CPC was transformed into hydroxyapatite when the composites were immersed in simulated body fluid. The PCL/TTCP/DCP composite had a higher compressive strength relative to PCL/TCP after setting, and this self-reinforcing property contributed to the hydration of TTCP/DCP and formation of apatite crystals. Thus, PCL/TTCP/DCP screws were prepared for animal studies. No postoperative mortality or complications were noted 6 months postsurgery. Biodegradation of the PCIITTCP/DCP screws and newly formed bony tissue around the degraded composites were shown on both micro computed tomography and histology. No peri-implant bone resorption was noted. Conclusion: The self-reinforcing PCL/TTCP/DCP composite can be used to fabricate biodegradable fixators for fracture management in craniomaxillofacial fracture fixation.

J	Maheshwari, J; Pandey, VK				Maheshwari, J.; Pandey, Vinay K.			Pseudarthrosis of the surgical neck of humerus treated by buttressing with a medial cortico-cancellous graft	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Pseudarthrosis; surgical neck humerus; medial buttressing; bone graft	INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; NONUNIONS; FRACTURES	Background: Pseudarthrosis of surgical neck of humerus is uncommon condition. Different methods of improving the stability of fixation have been described, including impaling the shaft into the head, placing a tension suture through the rotator cuff, or using an intramedullary cortical graft. We report our results of cortico-cancellous strut graft medially to counter the varus force, in conjunction with a fixed-angle implant on the lateral side. Materials and Methods: We used this technique in seven cases of pseudarthrosis of surgical neck of the humerus. There were four women and three men, ranging in age from 22 to 65 years. All were treated with a tricortical medial buttress bone graft and fixed-angle fixation device on the lateral side. A locking proximal humerus plate (Synthes) was used in six cases, and a bent reconstruction plate (Synthes) was applied in one case. The one in which reconstruction plate was applied was operated before the advent of locking plates. The limb was immobilized in 30 degrees of abduction over a cushion for 6 weeks, followed by a sling for another 6 weeks. Results: The followup varied from 18 to 96 months.

In developing countries, various factors such as illiteracy, low socioeconomic status, ignorance are responsible for the delay in surgery. Neglected fracture neck femur always poses a formidable challenge. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of triple muscle pedicle bone grafting using sartorius, tensor fasciae latae and part of gluteus medius in neglected femoral neck fracture. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study with medical record of 50 patients, who were operated by open reduction, internal fixation along with muscle pedicle bone grafting by the anterior approach. After open reduction, two to three cancellous screws (6.5 mm) were used for internal fixation in all cases. A bony chunk of the whole anterior superior iliac spine of 1 cm thickness, 1 cm width and 4.5 cm length, taken from the iliac crest comprised of muscle pedicle of sartorius, tensor fascia latae and part of gluteus medius. Then the graft with all three muscles mobilized and put in the trough made over the anterior or anterosuperior aspect of the femoral head. The graft was fixed with one or two 4.5 mm self-tapping cortical screw in anterior to posterior direction. Results: 14 patients were lost to followup. The results were based on 36 patients. We observed that in our series, there was union in 34, out of 36 (94.4%) patients. All patients were within the age group of 15-51 years (average 38 years) with displaced neglected femoral neck fracture of >= 30 days. Mean time taken for full clinicoradiological union was 14 weeks (range-10-24 weeks). Conclusion: Triple muscle pedicle bone grafting gives satisfactory results for neglected femoral neck fracture in physiologically active patients.

New techniques such as cryo-conservation allow rapid fixation and long-time storage but come along with increased costs and enlarged storage complexity. However, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue is available in a large quantity, making it the ideal material for retrospective studies. The following study was designed to investigate the influence of formalin-fixation on the quality of mRNA and applicability of FFPE-derived mRNA for gene expression analysis. Three potential reference genes for pulmonary tumors with neuroendocrine differentiation were included and tested for their robust expression. Materials and methods: Eighty specimens collected from 2005 to 2012 at the Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology at the University Hospital Essen were analyzed for their gene expression by using TaqMan (R) gene expression assays on demand (AoD). Three distinct potential reference genes (ACTB, GAPDH, HPRT1) were evaluated for their expression, and a proteasome subunit (PSMA1) was included in the analysis as tumor marker and functioned as an internal technical control. Conclusion: For GAPDH and ACTB, a highly significant correlation and consistent expression between the investigated entities was found, making them reliable reference genes for further research. Additionally, the feasibility for a FFPE tissue-based gene expression analysis was verified by showing that the mRNA quality is sufficient. When standardized FFPE preparation is performed carefully, sufficient mRNA can be isolated for reliable and successful gene expression analysis. That provides the basis the door for large, retrospective studies that correlate molecular and clinical follow-up data. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The existing models developed on small animal species prevent using osteosynthesis materials designed to be implanted in human bones. The goal of this study was to develop a nonunion process in a noncritical segmental tibial defect in sheep, a species analogous in size to humans. Materials and methods: The animals were divided into two groups of four animals each. In Group 1 (experimental), the defect was created by surgically stripping the periosteum from the edges of a distal tibial osteotomy, keeping the edges 5 mm apart, and placing an incomplete O-shaped silicone ring in the gap. Group 2 (control) was intervened with a simple fracture at the distal end of the tibia. In both groups an interlocking nail was used as a fixation system. Over 8 wk after surgery, radiographs and histologic and histomorphometric analyses were performed. Results: The control group showed a typical bone repair process. In contrast, the experimental group showed a fracture line with rounded edges and a scarce callus formation. The bone callus showed reduced amount of bone formation and large content of fibrous tissue (P = 0.001). Conclusions: These results indicate that our model developed an atrophic nonunion in sheep, a species having multiple similarities to humans, such as weight, size, bone structure, and bone remodeling process.

The goal was to reduce the overgrowth of bioreactor internals and sensors while better rheological properties in the fermentation broth, such as oxygen transfer and mixing time, can be achieved. Because this could not be accomplished with continuous culture and fed-batch fermentation, repeated-batch fermentation was implemented with the help of additional bioreactor internals ("sporulation supports"). This should capture some biomass during fermentation. After harvesting the suspended biomass, intermediate cleaning was performed using a cleaning device. The biomass retained on the sporulation support went through the sporulation phase. The spores were subsequently used as inocula for the next batch. The reason for this approach was that the retained pellets could otherwise cause problems (e.g., overgrowth on sensors) in subsequent batches because the fungus would then show undesirable hyphal growth. Various sporulation supports were tested for sufficient biomass fixation to start the next batch. A reproducible spore concentration within the range of the requirements could be achieved by adjusting the sporulation support (design and construction material), and an intermediate cleaning adapted to this.

This multicenter study aimed to investigate the incidence of FRI and clarify the risk factors associated with FRI in patients receiving open reduction and internal fixation for proximal humerus fracture. Material and methods: Among 684 patients diagnosed as having proximal humerus fracture and who were treated by surgical therapy in 13 institutions (named TRON group) from 2015 through 2020, 496 patients (men, n = 134, women, n = 362; mean [SD] age, 68.5 [14.5] years; mean [SD] body mass index [BMI], 23.0 [4.4] kg/m(2)) were included as subjects. Excluded were 188 patients due to less than 12 month's follow-up, patients who underwent osteosynthesis using neither plate nor nail and those with open fracture. We extracted the following as risk factors of FRI: sex, BMI, smoking status, diabetes, glenohumeral fracture dislocation, fracture classification, approach, implant, waiting period, type of anesthesia, operative time and blood loss during surgery. We conducted logistic regression analysis to investigate the risk factors of FRI using these extracted items as explanatory variables and the presence or absence of FRI as the response variable. Result: FRI occurred after surgery for proximal humerus fracture in 9 of the 496 patients (1.8%). The causative organism was methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus in 4 patients, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in one patient and Enterococcus faecalis in one patient. In the other 3 patients, causative organisms were not detected. The univariate analysis showed significant differences for present of glenohumeral fracture dislocation (p = 0.004). Logistic regression analysis showed glenohumeral fracture dislocation to be the significant explanatory factor for FRI (odds ratio 12.3, p = 0.0375). Conclusion: This study revealed an infection rate following open reduction and internal fixation of proximal humerus fracture of 1.8% (9 patients) and that Staphylococcus was the most frequent causative organism. Glenohumeral fracture dislocation is a significant risk for postoperative FRI. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Percutaneous Ablation, Osteoplasty, Reinforcement, and Internal Fixation for Pain and Ambulatory Function in Periacetabular Osteolytic Malignancies	RADIOLOGY			English	Article							IMAGE-GUIDED ABLATION; CT HOUNSFIELD UNITS; GIANT-CELL TUMOR; PELVIC BONE; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; RECONSTRUCTION; CEMENTOPLASTY; CEMENT; METASTASES; LESIONS	Background: Osteolytic neoplasms to periacetabular bone frequently cause pain and fractures. Immediate recovery is integral to lifesaving ambulatory oncologic care and maintaining quality of life. Yet, open acetabular reconstructive surgeries are associated with numerous complications that delay cancer treatments. Purpose: To determine the effectiveness for short- and long-term pain and ambulatory function following percutaneous ablation, osteoplasty, reinforcement, and internal fixation (AORIF) for periacetabular osteolytic neoplasm. Materials and Methods: This retrospective observational study evaluated clinical data from 50 patients (mean age, 65 years +/- 14 [SD]; 25 men, 25 women) with osteolytic periacetabular metastases or myeloma. The primary outcome of combined pain and ambulatory function index score (range, 1 [bedbound] through 10 [normal ambulation]) was assessed before and after AORIF at 2 weeks and then every 3 months up to 40 months (overall median follow-up, 11 months [IQR, 4-14 months]). Secondary outcomes included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, infection, transfusion, 30-day readmission, mortality, and conversion hip arthroplasty. Serial radiographs and CT images were obtained to assess the hip joint integrity. The paired t test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to analyze data. Results: Mean combined pain and ambulatory function index scores improved from 4.5 +/- 2.4 to 7.8 +/- 2.1 (P <.001) and median ECOG scores from 3 (IQR, 2-4) to 1 (IQR, 1-2) (P <.001) at the first 2 weeks after AORIF. Of 22 nonambulatory patients, 19 became ambulatory on their first post-AORIF visit. Pain and functional improvement were retained beyond 1 year, up to 40 months after AORIF in surviving patients. No hardware failures, surgical site infections, readmissions, or delays in care were identified following AORIF. Of 12 patients with protrusio acetabuli, one patient required a conversion hemiarthroplasty at 24 months. Conclusion: The ablation, osteoplasty, reinforcement, and internal fixation, or AORIF, technique was effective for short- and long-term improvement of pain and ambulatory function in patients with periacetabular osteolytic neoplasm.

However, common plates were poorly matched to femur, which was because they were designed based on anatomical parameters of the Western populations. Therefore, the aim was to design an end-structure of the anatomical proximal femoral locking plate that closely matched the anatomy of the Chinese population. Materials and methods: From January 2010 to December 2021, consecutive patients aged 18 years and older who underwent a full-length computed tomography scan of the femur were included. The end-structure (male and female model) of the anatomical proximal femoral locking plate was designed based on anatomical parameters of femurs that were measured in three-dimensional space using computer-assisted virtual technology. The match degree between the end-structure and femur were evaluated. Inter-observer and intra-observer agreement for the evaluation of match degree was assessed. The matching evaluation based on a three-dimensional printing model was regarded as the gold standard to assess the reliability. Results: A total of 1672 patients were included, with 701 men and 971 women. Significant differences were seen between male and female for all parameters of the proximal femur (all P< 0.001). All match degree of end-structure was over 90%. Inter-observer and intra-observer agreement was almost perfect (all kappa value, > 0.81). The sensitivity, specificity, and percentage of correct interpretation of matching evaluation in the computer-assisted virtual model was all greater than 95%. From femur reconstruction to completion of internal fixation matching, the process takes about 3 min. Moreover, reconstruction, measurement, and matching were all completed in one system. Conclusions: The results showed that based on the larger sample of femoral anatomical parameters, a highly matching end-structure of anatomical proximal femoral locking plate for Chinese population could be designed with use of computer-assisted imaging technology.

This study investigates a novel strategy for minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis of distal tibia fractures called bionic lightweight design plating. Following the structure of the animal trabecular bone, we utilized topological mathematical methods to redesign the material layout of the internal fixation device to fulfill the desired lightweight design within given boundary conditions. The results showed that this method can maintain the same stability of the construct as the original plate after a reduction in the original volume by 30%, and the differences in strain energy of plates and maximum node displacement of constructs between the constructs [RP construct vs. LP construct] were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). In the safety assessment of the constructs, the peak stress of plates between constructs was found to not be statistically significantly different under a doubled physiological load (p > 0.05). The average stress of the plates' elements exceeding the allowable stress was analyzed, and no statistically significant differences were found between the two constructs under axial compression stress conditions (p > 0.05). The average stress of the plates' elements in the redesigned plating construct under torsional stress conditions was 3.08% less than that of the locked plating construct (p < 0.05). Under the double physiological load condition, 89% of the elements of the plate in the redesigned plating construct and 85% of the elements of the plate in the locked plating construct were lower than the maximum safe stress of the plate, which was 410 MPa (secondary allowable stresses). That reminds us the topology optimization offer a possible way to improve the capacity of soft tissue protection while ensuring the safety of the RP construct by reducing the volume of the implants.

Treatment of Periprosthetic Femoral Fractures Vancouver Type B2: Revision Arthroplasty Versus Open Reduction and Internal Fixation With Locking Compression Plate	GERIATRIC ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY & REHABILITATION			English	Article						total hip arthroplasty (THA); periprosthetic fractures; Vancouver B2; locking compression plate (LCP); femoral stem loosening	TOTAL HIP; CLASSIFICATION-SYSTEM; FEMUR FRACTURES; FAILURE; RELIABILITY; MORTALITY; VALIDITY; MOBILITY; B1	Introduction: The Vancouver algorithm recommends revision arthroplasty (RA) for Vancouver type B2 (VTB2) fractures. However, open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using locking compression plates (LCP) may be a valid and less invasive alternative treatment. Materials and Methods: Between January 2007 and March 2017, we retrospectively recruited all patients treated with either ORIF with LCP or RA for VTB2 fractures in our clinic. All of the following were reviewed: the length of hospital stay, the operating time, the need for blood transfusions during and/or after surgery, implant-related and patient-related complications, need for revision surgery, and the radiological outcome. Additionally, the functional outcome was investigated. Results: Fifty-nine patients were recruited. Thirty-five (59.3%) patients underwent RA, while 24 (40.7%) patients received ORIF with LCP. The median surgical time was 137.50 minutes in the LCP group compared to 160.00 minutes in the RA group (P = .051). Three (12.5%) patients in the LCP group and 10 (28.6%) patients in the RA group experienced an implant-associated complication (P = .131). Patient-related complications occurred in 3 (12.5%) patients in the LCP group versus 6 (17.1%) patients in the RA group (P = .628). The mean preoperative Parker mobility score was 9 points in both groups and decreased in both groups to a mean of 5 points in the LCP and 7 points in the RA group. Discussion: Open reduction and internal fixation with LCP seems to be a less invasive procedure for VTB2 fractures in comparison to RA. It is a bone-sparing procedure that can be advantageous for further revision operations. Moreover, some fractures can only be anatomically reduced by ORIF with LCP, whereas for proximal fractures with a radiologically unambiguously loosened stem RA might be advantageous. Conclusion: In line with previously published studies, our data suggest that ORIF using LCP is a valid treatment option for VTB2 fractures.

It often leads to loosening of wires, dislocation of fracture, hardware problem and failure of osteosynthesis, resulting in knee stiffness and post-traumatic osteoarthritis. The aim of the study is to evaluate clinical outcome in patients with acute patella fractures (< 3 week) treated with unidirectional angle fixed low-profile titanium patella locking plate. Materials and methods Twenty patients who presented with displaced patella fractures, aged between 18-70 years were included in the study. All fractures were reduced and fixed with unidirectional angle fixed stable low-profile titanium patella locking plate. Knee Range of motion and Knee Outcome Survey Activities of Daily Living Scale (KOS-ADL) was used to evaluate the outcome. Results We were able to achieve union in 19 out of 20 patients. One patient with comminuted patella fracture had failure of fixation, which was revised. Mean flexion at final follow-up was 124 degrees (110 degrees-130 degrees) and none of the patients had extensor lag. The final radiograph revealed complete union in all patients. Conclusion This technique offers an option of fixation in comminuted patella fracture and in osteoporotic individuals. It provides mechanical stability for fracture fixation resulting in anatomical reduction, good functional outcome, lower incidence of symptomatic implant or failure of osteosynthesis.

Surgical fixation is an effective method for sternal fracture. Methods: The clinical data of patients with sternal fractures who presented to our hospital between August 2016 and July 2019 were collected. The 42 patients were divided into three groups, with 15 patients treated by internal fixation with NI-TI memory alloy embracing fixator, 10 patients receiving steel wire fixation, and 17 who received non-surgical treatment and who was designated as a control (conservative) group. Differences in clinical indices included the duration of surgery, blood loss, hospitalization, wound healing, hospitalization expenses, VAS scores, and patient satisfaction scores between the three groups was compared. The analysis of variance and t-test were used for quantitative variables, which were approximately normally distributed. Dichotomous data were compared used Pearson ?2 or Fisher?s exact test, and a P value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: All patients were cured, and there were no significant differences in general clinical features between the three groups (P 0.05). Thoracic deformity in the surgical groups was corrected anatomically and received better pain scores, while patients in the NI-TI memory alloy embracing fixator group showed advantages of bleeding and patient satisfaction (P<0.05). Conclusions: Operative treatment for a sternal fracture is safe, effective and can quickly restore the stability of the thorax. Memory alloy embracing fixator is markedly superior to other fixator materials.

We present a simple alternative to the metallic operating table by placing the patient on a spinal board that will allow for a better radiological assessment of these fractures. Material and methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive, and retrospective study was carried out in the period between 2015 and 2020. The study population was all patients with pelvic o spine fractures, managed surgically using a spinal board in the Spanish Role 2 or in the Spanish Role 4. Results: Seven patients underwent surgery in total using a spinal board, pelvic fracture being the the main diagnosis (n= 6; 85.71%). The distribution of surgical procedures was as follows: percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (one case), external fixation of the pelvis (two cases), percutaneous screw fixation of the pelvis (two cases), and open reduction and internal fixation of the pelvis (two cases). The mean duration of surgical interventions was 52 minutes, and a successful reduction and synthesis of the fracture was obtained in all the patients, with no complications reported. Conclusion: A spinal board can be a useful, simple, and effective device for the orthopedic surgeon in the deployed setting. The described technique is simple, fast, and efficient in getting a complete radiological assessment of complex regions such as the pelvis and the spine, facilitating the surgical management of these injuries	[Crego Vita, Diana M.; Garcia Canas, Rafael; Rodriguez Moro, Carlos; Prieto Vazquez, Maria; Areta Jimenez, Javier] Def Cent Hosp Gomez Ulla, Orthoped Surg & Traumatol Unit, Madrid 28047, Spain		Vita, DMC (corresponding author), Def Cent Hosp Gomez Ulla, Orthoped Surg & Traumatol Unit, Madrid 28047, Spain.		; GARCIA-CANAS, RAFAEL/AAP-1943-2020	Crego Vita, Diana/0000-0002-4751-8363; Rodriguez Moro, Carlos/0000-0002-9211-8828; GARCIA-CANAS, RAFAEL/0000-0001-9427-4114					16	0	0	0	1	OXFORD UNIV PRESS	OXFORD	GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND	0026-4075	1930-613X		MIL MED	Milit.

Nevertheless, it requires careful handling to avoid unexpected failure. The aim of this study was to examine five clinically broken zirconia implant abutments using fractography principles. Materials and Methods: Five clinically fractured zirconia abutments were retrieved for fractographic analysis. The specimens were cleaned, sterilized, and reassembled to allow reconstruction of the broken abutments. Each fragment was gold sputter-coated and individually examined using scanning electron microscopy. The location of the crack origin was identified and the stress at failure was estimated using fracture marks observed on the broken surfaces. Results: For three abutments, the critical crack was located at the internal ring where the abutments met the internal metallic component. The estimated stress at failure ranged between 978 and 1,228 MPa. Friction landmarks were observed on the surface of the fixation screw, which could be responsible for the generation of high internal stresses. Two abutments broke due to overpreparation and thinning of the lateral walls. Conclusion: A confirmatory radiograph is recommended before the final zirconia abutments are screwed into place to prevent improper seating and the generation of damaging internal stresses.

The objective of the current study is to evaluate the outcome of hip arthroplasty after hardware retrieval as a one-stage replacement, to analyze possible differences related to the type of removed implant, and to assess the impact of unexpected intraoperative cultures during implant retrieval. Materials and methods We present a retrospective study including all those cases undergoing hip arthroplasty with concomitant hardware removal (cannulated screws, intramedullary nail, or dynamic hip screw) from 2005 to 2018. We evaluated demographics, intraoperative cultures, early infection rate, and other complications. Results A total of 55 cases were included in the study. The median time between the implant surgery and the hip arthroplasty was 113 days. The removed devices included 6 cannulated screws, 34 intramedullary nails, and 15 dynamic hip screws. Up to 74.5% of the failed osteosynthesis belonged to intertrochanteric femoral fractures. Dislocation rate was 9.1% (1.8% requiring revision surgery), 25.5% of the cases needed further new surgeries after the hip arthroplasty, and 49.1% died during the follow-up period. Any-cause revision surgery and mortality rates were significantly increased after intramedullary nail removal. Intraoperative cultures were performed in 46 cases, and in 9 (16.4%), there was bacterial contamination: 6 cases (10.9%) presented one single positive culture and 3 (5.5%) presented >= 2 positive cultures for the same microorganism. A total of five cases (9.1%) presented early prosthetic joint infection that required debridement. None of these five cases had presented positive cultures at the implant removal. Conclusion According to our results, hip arthroplasty with concomitant hardware removal is related to a high 5-year mortality rate, mainly when intramedullary nail is retrieved. Whereas a high risk of early prosthetic joint infection is associated, it seems not to be related to the elevated presence of unexpected positive cultures.

Ankle fractures in the elderly: Treatment and results in 477 patients	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Ankle fractures; Recovery of function; Elderly; Risk factors; Surgery	BONE-MINERAL DENSITY; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OSTEOPOROTIC FRACTURES; OPERATIVE TREATMENT; OPEN REDUCTION; HIP; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; DATABASE; WOMEN	Introdution: In the elderly, ankle fractures are likely to cause specific complications and have a major impact on their autonomy. The goal of this multicentre study was to assess these outcomes in a geriatric population treated operatively. Material and methods: This retrospective study included 477 patients with ankle fractures treated surgically between 2008 and 2014. The minimum age was 60 years for women and 70 for men. Patients with a tibial pilon fracture or less than 3 months' follow-up were excluded. Functional (autonomy and comorbidities) and radiological assessments were performed before surgery and at the review. Results: The cohort was 81% female (384 women, 93 men) and had median age of 74 years. The preoperative autonomy was 7.8 points on average using the Parker score. Most of the fractures were either Weber type B (n=336) or type C (n=114). At the follow-up, the mean autonomy score was 7.3 points. The fibula was fixed with a plate and screws in 69% of cases (n=325), with additional internal malleolar fixation was carried out in some cases. A satisfactory result, defined as 2 points or less reduction in the Parker score, was found in 89.9% of patients; 71.8% had not lost any autonomy. The main risk factors for loss of autonomy were being more than 80 years of age (OR=2.93, P<0.001), poor surgical reduction (OR=2.8, P<0.01), the presence of two or more comorbidities (OR=2.71, P<0.001), being female (OR=2.19, P<0.043) or having a Weber type C fracture (OR=2.05, P=0.023). Discussion: The functional results are satisfactory overall following standard surgical treatment consisting of internal malleolar and fibular fixation for ankle fractures in the elderly. We identified five factors that greatly impact functional recovery. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

J	Pingle, J				Pingle, Jairamchander			Transfracture abduction osteotomy: A solution for nonunion of femoral neck fractures	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Femoral neck fracture; nonunion; transfracture abduction osteotomy	INTERNAL-FIXATION; UNION	Background: Nonunion and avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head remains one of the major complications following femoral neck fractures. Despite various surgical techniques and internal fixation devices, the incidence of nonunion and AVN has remained unsolved. Neglected nonunion of femoral neck fracture is common in the developing world. Treatment options include rigid internal fixation with or without bone grafting, muscle pedicle bone graft, valgus osteotomy of the proximal femur with or without bone graft, valgus osteotomy or hip arthroplasty. We conducted a retrospective analysis of cases of nonunion of femoral neck fracture treated by transfracture abduction osteotomy (TFAO). Materials and Methods: Over a period of 35 years (1974-2008), 30 patients with nonunion of femoral neck fractures were treated with TFAO over a period of 35 years (1974-2008), All patients were less than 50 years of age. Absence of clinical and radiological signs of union after four months was considered as nonunion. Patients more than 50 years of age were excluded from the study. Union was assessed at 6 months radiologically. Limb length was measured at six months. The mean duration of femoral neck fracture was 19 months (range 4 months 10 years). Results were analyzed in terms of radiological union at six months. Average followup was five years and six months. Results: Consistent union was noted at the followup after six months in 29 cases. One case was lost to followup after five and one-half months postoperatively. However, the fracture had united in this case at the last followup. Average shortening of the limb at six months was 1.9 cm. Average neck shaft angle was 127 (range 120-145). Five cases went into AVN but were asymptomatic. Two cases required reoperation due to back out of Moore's pins. These were reopened and cancellous screws were inserted in the same tracks. Conclusions: Consistent union of nonunion femoral neck fracture was noted at the followup after six months in 29 cases. The major drawback of the procedure is immobilization of the patient in the hip spica for eight weeks.

To promote bone growth on the material surface and increase the degradation rate of the polymer, research is currently focused on organic-inorganic composites by adding a bioactive mineral to the polymer matrix. The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of a poly(l,dl-lactide)-Bioglass (R) (P(l,dl)LA-Bioglass((R)) 45S5) composite to be used as a bone fixation device. In vitro cell viability testing of P(l,dl)LA based composites containing different amounts of Bioglass((R)) 45S5 particles was investigated. According to the degradation rate of the P(l,dl)LA matrix and the cytocompatibility experiments, the composite with 30 wt % of Bioglass (R) particles seemed to be the best candidate for further investigation. To study its behavior after immersion in simulated physiological conditions, the degradation of the composite was analyzed by measuring its weight loss and mechanical properties and by proceeding with X-ray tomography. We demonstrated that the presence of the bioactive glass significantly accelerated the in vitro degradation of the polymer. A preliminary in vivo investigation on rabbits shows that the addition of 30 wt % of Bioglass((R)) in the P(L,DL)LA matrix seems to trigger bone osseointegration especially during the first month of implantation. This composite has thus strong potential interest for health applications. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part B: Appl Biomater, 104B: 180-191, 2016.

Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and palliative durability of collimated-beam CT-guided percutaneous fixation with internal cemented screws (FICS) for impending pathologic fractures of the femoral neck. Materials and Methods: This single-institute retrospective study examined all patients with metastatic cancer treated between February 2010 and October 2019 with collimated-beam CT-guided percutaneous FICS procedures for preventive consolidation of impending femoral neck pathologic fractures. The short-term palliative efficacy was assessed through comparison of visual analog scale (VAS) scores before and 1 month after FICS. A review of cross-section imaging and clinic reports identified any procedural complications. Long-term consolidation efficacy was defined as the absence of any screw dislodgement or development of a pathologic fracture at completion of the study. The Wilcoxon test was used for the mean comparison of paired nonparametric variables. Results: Sixty-one consecutive patients (mean age, 59 years +/- 11 [standard deviation]; 35 women) underwent preventive FICS for consolidation of impending pathologic femoral neck fracture with a mean follow-up of 533 days +/- 689. Two patients died of cancer within the first month. Complications were limited to three self-resolving hematomas. The mean VAS score decreased 1 month after FICS from 4.2 +/- 3.2 to 1.8 +/- 2.0 (P,.001). The long-term consolidation efficacy was 92% (54 of 59 patients), with three of 59 patients (5%) subsequently developing fractures despite FICS and an additional two of 59 patients (3%) with durable FICS undergoing definitive total hip arthroplasty surgery because of local tumor progression. Conclusion: Percutaneous fixation with internal cemented screws as performed by the interventional radiologist is a safe nonsurgical treatment that provides an effective palliative result and durable prevention for impending pathologic fractures of the femoral neck.

Surgical site infection in tibial plateau fractures with ipsilateral compartment syndrome	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Compartment syndrome; Tibial plateau fracture; Surgical site infection; Complication	OPERATIVE FIXATION; INTERNAL-FIXATION; RISK-FACTORS; COMPLICATIONS; FASCIOTOMY	Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of compartment syndrome and timing of fasciotomy wound closure on surgical site infection (SSI) after surgical fixation of tibial plateau fractures. Our primary hypothesis was that SSI rate is increased for fractures with compartment syndrome versus those without, even accounting for confounders associated with infection. Our secondary hypothesis was that infection rates are unrelated to timing of fasciotomy closure or fixation. Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of operative tibial plateau fractures with ipsilateral compartment syndrome (n = 71) treated with fasciotomy at our level I trauma center from 2003 through 2011. A control group consisted of 602 patients with 625 operatively treated tibial plateau fractures without diagnosis of compartment syndrome. The primary outcome measure was deep SSI after ORIF. Results: Fractures with compartment syndrome had a higher rate of SSI (25% versus 8%, p < 0.001). The difference remained significant in our multivariate model (odds ratio, 7.27; 95% confidence interval, 3.813.9). Delay in timing of fasciotomy closure was associated with a 7% increase per day in odds of infection (95% confidence interval, 0.2-13; p < 0.05). Conclusions: Tibial plateau fractures with ipsilateral compartment syndrome have a significant increase in rates of SSI compared with those without compartment syndrome (p < 0.001). Delays in fasciotomy wound closure were also associated with increased odds of SSI (p < 0.05). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lindahl, H; Malchau, H; Odén, A; Garellick, G				Lindahl, H; Malchau, H; Odén, A; Garellick, G			Risk factors for failure after treatment of a periprosthetic fracture of the femur	JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-BRITISH VOLUME			English	Article							FEMORAL-SHAFT FRACTURES; HIP-ARTHROPLASTY; REPLACEMENT; MANAGEMENT; FIXATION; CLASSIFICATION; PLATE; KNEE; STEM	Periprosthetic fracture of the femur is an uncommon complication after total hip replacement, but appears to be increasing. We undertook a nationwide observational study to determine the risk factors for failure after treatment of these fractures, examining patient- and implant-related factors, the classification of the fractures and the outcome. Between 1979 and 2000, 1049 periprosthetic fractures of the femur were reported to the Swedish National Hip Arthroplasty Register. Of these, 245 had a further operation after failure of their initial management. Data were collected from the Register and hospital records. The material was analysed by the use of Poisson regression models. It was found that the risk of failure of treatment was reduced for Vancouver type B2 injuries (p = 0.0053) if revision of the implant was undertaken (p = 0.0033) or revision and open reduction and internal fixation (p = 0.0039) were performed. Fractures classified as Vancouver type B1 had a significantly higher risk of failure (p = 0.0001). The strongest negative factor was the use of a single plate for fixation (p = 0.001). The most common reasons for failure in this group were loosening of the femoral prosthesis, nonunion and refracture. It is probable that many fractures classified as Vancouver type B1 (n = 304), were in reality type B2 fractures with a loose stem which were not recognised. Plate fixation was inadequate in these cases. The difficulty in separating type B1 from type B2 fractures suggests that the prosthesis should be considered as loose until proven otherwise.

Patellar fractures account for approximately 1% of all fractures. Due to the patella's importance as regards the extensor mechanism, effort should be made to preserve the patella. Several operative treatment methods have been introduced for patella fractures. Objectives. This study aims to compare the clinical effect of a titanium cable tension band and nickel-titanium (NiTi) patella concentrator (NT-PC) in treating patella fractures. Material and methods. Thirty-nine patients with patella fractures were enrolled in this retrospective study. All the patients were treated via the open reduction internal fixation procedure using a titanium cable tension band or NT-PC. All the patients were followed up over an average period of 13 months. The main outcome measures were operation time, time of fracture union, postoperative complications, and Bostman knee scores. Statistical analyses were conducted between the 2 groups. Results. All the patients were operated on successfully. The operation time of the NT-PC treatment group was less than that of the titanium cable tension band treatment group (p < 0.05). The mean scores at the final follow-up were 28.2 and 27.6 points in the titanium cable tension band and NT-PC groups, respectively. No significant difference was observed between the excellent and good results (p > 0.05). Conclusions. Both titanium cable tension band and NT-PC showed good efficacy for the treatment of patellar fractures. NT-PC fixation, a new option for the treatment of patella fractures, is a simple and effective fixation method.

J	Tennent, TD; Pearse, EO; Eastwood, DM				Tennent, Thomas D.; Pearse, Eyiyemi O.; Eastwood, Deborah M.			A new technique for stabilizing adolescent posteriorly displaced physeal medial clavicular fractures	JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY			English	Article						Adolescent; medial clavicle fracture; sternoclavicular joint; physeal injury	RETROSTERNAL DISLOCATION; CHILDREN; INJURY	Background: Adolescent posteriorly displaced physeal injuries of the medial clavicle are uncommon. Up to 50% of conservatively treated patients remain symptomatic, and late surgery is hazardous. Stability is rarely achieved with closed or open reduction alone, and internal fixation is usually required. Previously described options for fixation achieve stability of the medial clavicle by securing it to the intact epiphysis. Because the epiphyseal fragment is small, fixation is achieved using sutures or wires. This relies on the size and structural integrity of the medial fragment, which in our experience can be variable. We hypothesized that a novel technique of operative stabilization of these injuries, which does not require fixation to the epiphyseal fragment and uses no metalwork, is safe and effective in treating these injuries. Materials and methods: The operative technique involves suturing the medial clavicle to the anterior platysmal and periosteal layer using absorbable sutures passed through drill holes in the medial clavicle. Patients were assessed clinically an average of 9 months after surgery. Results: We treated 7 patients with this method. There were no intraoperative complications. All patients were pain-free and symptom-free and had a full range of movement at follow-up. All patients had returned to their preinjury level of sports. Conclusions: We recommend this technique for treating these uncommon injuries. It is simple, safe, and reproducible and it produces good results.

Materials and methods: Three-dimensional models were constructed for the five miniplates with their screws and integrated into a virtually fractured mandible that was derived from a computed tomographic image of living human. Patient-specific finite element models were analyzed to compare the performances of the miniplates. Miniplates were compared for titanium hardware volume, condylar head displacement, bone strains and miniplates' stresses. Results: Least condylar head displacement, and thereby best fixation primary stability, was found in the trapezoid miniplate. On the other hand, the greatest displacements were found in lambda and strut miniplates. Bone strains, as an indicator of secondary stability, predicted high strains in bone around the screws affixing the delta miniplate. Therefore, high risk of failure due to screws loosening is expected when using the delta miniplate. Stresses in miniplates were excessive in the strut and lambda miniplates, which implies a high risk of miniplate fracture. Conclusions: The current findings predicted significant differences in performance among the different designs of three-dimensional miniplates. The trapezoid miniplate seems to have the best performance, as it provided the greatest rigidity with relatively low bone strains. (C) 2018 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.

Currently, the materials commonly used in bone plates are stainless steel and titanium, which often lead to stress shielding effects because of their higher elastic modulus compared with the bone. This article suggests an optimal design method of lattice bone plate based on fracture healing theory. First, the mechanical regulation model with deviatoric strain is established to simulate the tissue differentiation process during fracture healing process. The ratio of the average elastic modulus of callus at the 120th day to the elastic modulus of mature bone is used to characterize the fracture healing rate. Second, the optimal elastic modulus of the design domain is obtained by the optimization mathematical model with the maximum fracture healing rate. Then, the design domain is filled with microstructures, the porosity of which is adjusted to make it possible that the equivalent elastic modulus is equal to the optimized value. And the finite element analysis of the bone plate with microstructure is executed. Finally, the designed lattice bone plates are manufactured through 3D printing, and the mechanical test is carried out. The simulation results indicate that the fracture healing rate is maximum when the elastic modulus of material in design domain is 38 GPa under the constraints of fixation stability. And both the finite element analysis and experiment results show that the designed lattice bone plate meet the strength requirements of fracture internal fixation implants.

PLLA/beta-tricalciumphosphate (PLLA/TCP) (70 %/30 %) screw, 3. poly-l-lactide-co-glycolic acid/beta-tricalciumphosphate (PLGA/TCP) (70 %/30 %) screw and 4. PLLA pin] were incubated with human osteoblast-like cells. All probes were evaluated after 3,7,14 and 21 days by cell number count, determination of cell proliferation, observation of cell adhesion of human osteoblast-like cells under an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM), and by a live-dead assay. Cell numbers were lower at all stages in both PLLA groups compared to the composite materials (PLLA/TCP and PLGA/TCP). A significant difference in cell proliferation was found after 21 days. The cells on both composite screws (PLLA/TCP and PLGA/TCP) maintained more contact points with the screw surface compared to the cells on PLLA screws under ESEM. No cytotoxicity could be observed in the live-dead assay. Mainly, beta-TCP as part of a composite implant seems to offer good ultrastructural properties for cell adhesion according to our in vitro study. Cell numbers seem to be influenced by the degradation behaviour with higher cell numbers in the composite groups.

Conventional aqueous reactive dyeing is widely used for cotton, generating large quantities of wastewater containing high concentrations of hydrolyzed dyes and salts. Although new reactive dyeing technologies have been developed to reduce pollutant discharge, they all failed due to release of toxic organic solvents or high costs. In the newly developed dual-liquid-phase system, spent cooking oil is served as external phase to disperse reactive dyes, while water is served as internal phase to swell cotton and fix dyes with alkali. 100% of reactive dyes move into the internal phase without the help of salts due to high chemical potential of dyes in the external phase. Compared to conventional aqueous system, the dual-liquid-phase system improves dye fixation by 33% and reduces discharge of dyes by 82% when the initial input of dyes is 3% owf. Discharge of salts is reduced by 100%. The external phase is reusable and biodegradable. Cotton fabrics were dyed with the dual-liquid-phase system on a pilot scale and achieved the same dyeing quality as those from conventional aqueous system. The dual-liquid-phase system also consumes less materials and energy than conventional aqueous system, indicating economic feasibility. The dual-liquid-phase system could be applied to current dyeing equipment, enabling quick implementation of lab results into real production. Clean large-scale reactive dyeing could be achieved with the dual-phase-liquid system. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Materials and methods: This retrospective study included 28 patients who received osteosynthesis treatment between March 2010 and December 2015. Primary conservative treatment had failed in all patients. All surgical procedures were performed via the posterior approach without olecranon osteotomy and with the use of double-locking plates for each column. Results: The mean patient age was 72 years, and surgical procedures were performed a mean of 7.6 months after injury. Preoperatively, extension-flexion was 32 degrees to 101 degrees and forearm pronation-supination was 74 degrees to 47 degrees. The mean visual analog scale score was 4; the mean Mayo Elbow Performance Score was 50; and the mean Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score was 58. All cases showed proper union after a mean of 5.2 months. At the final follow-up examination, the extension-flexion and rotation arcs had improved significantly (to 20 degrees to 124 degrees and to 80 degrees to 66 degrees, respectively; both P <.001), and all clinical scores were satisfactory (visual analog scale score, 1; Mayo Elbow Performance Score, 65; and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score, 24; all P <.001). Ulnar nerve transposition was performed in 7 patients, and no distinct ulnar nerve symptom was observed in any patient at the final follow-up examination. Conclusions: We consider osteosynthesis by open reduction and internal fixation as a recommended option for extra-articular distal humeral fractures in elderly patients aged 70 years or older in whom conservative treatment has failed.

JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							MAXILLOMANDIBULAR FIXATION; MAXILLOFACIAL TRAUMA; INTERNAL-FIXATION; ROOT DAMAGE; MANAGEMENT; REDUCTION; OUTCOMES	Purpose: Intermaxillary fixation (IMF) is traditionally achieved with arch bars; however, this method has several well-known disadvantages and other techniques, such as bone screws, are available. This study evaluated current evidence regarding these IMF screws (IMFSs) for mandibular trauma and to assess whether this allows a change of treatment protocol for IMF. Materials and Methods: A systematic electronic literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Titles and abstracts retrieved from the search were screened and evaluated for inclusion and exclusion criteria. The full text of all relevant articles was read and citation lists were checked for any missing references. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were subjected to a quality assessment. Included articles were checked for outcome measurements concerning occlusion, operative time, oral hygiene, root trauma, wire-stick injuries, and mucosa overgrowth. Results: Twenty-two articles (17 case series, 4 RCTs, and 1 cohort study) were included. None of the RCTs scored high methodologic results in the quality assessment. The results suggest IMFSs have similar malocclusion rates as arch bars, fewer wire-stick injuries, improved oral hygiene, and shorter operative time. Root damage is less likely to occur with self-drilling screws and seldom requires treatment. Conclusions: Although the methodologic quality of the included studies is poor, self-drilling IMFSs are recommended for temporary per-operative IMF of noncomminuted mandibular fractures. More high-quality studies are required to allow an evidence-based change of protocol.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of screw size and insertion technique on the stability of sagittal split osteotomies. Materials and methods: This study used twenty polyurethane replicas of human hemimandibles with a prefabricated sagittal split ramus osteotomy (SSRO). The hemimandibles were stabilized with 1.5 mm and 2.0 mm titanium screws inserted in an inverted L configuration. All specimens were tested to determine the strength and stability of the fixation. Results: In all cases there was failure of the synthetic bone before there was any evidence of screw failure. There were no significant differences in the load necessary to make the construct fail between the 1.5 or 2.0 mm screw sizes. Conclusion: There was no statistically significant difference between the strengths achieved with screws of 1.5 and 2.0 mm diameters for fixation of SSRO performed in synthetic mandibles. There was no fracture of the 1.5 mm or 2.0 mm diameter screws in any of the tests. 1.5 mm diameter screws in an inverted L pattern have as much stability and mechanical resistance as a 2.0 mm screw, may be safely used for this procedure.

Fractures are a common complication of osteopetrosis, which are challenging for orthopedic surgeons to treat because the condition renders canal reaming and screw placement difficult. Materials and Methods: Data of patients with osteopetrosis from 2011 to 2019, which were available from an electronic medical database, were retrospectively analyzed. Inclusion criteria were patients with osteopetrosis having subtrochanteric fractures who were followed up for at least 72 months; 2 patients were identified. Results: Case 1 was a 38-year-old male and Case 2 was a 79-year-old female. Both had left subtrochanteric fractures identified using X-ray that were classified as AO 32-A3.3 and AO 31-A3.3 and treated by open reduction and internal fixation using a reversed distal femoral locking compression plate (DePuy Synthes, Obedors, Switzerland). For Case 1, fracture union was confirmed 8 months after surgery and the patient recovered the ability to walk independently using a cane, which was consistent with his pre-injury functioning. Complications were not observed during the 7-year follow-up period. For Case 2, fracture union was confirmed 9 months after surgery. She was able to walk using a crutch, which was consistent with her pre-injury functioning. Complications were not observed during the 8-year follow-up period. Conclusions: We propose that there is a greater need for anatomic reduction when treating subtrochanteric fracture in patients with osteopetrosis. In order to address this issue, we recommend the surgical option involving internal fixation with a locking plate that is conducted in the lateral decubitus position. This position could benefit patients with osteopetrosis having proximal femoral fractures because anatomic reduction and plate stabilization minimize the potential injury to the abductor mechanism.

Correlation between risk factors and subsequent surgical management following internal fixation of intracapsular femoral neck fractures in patients under the age of 60 years	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND EMERGENCY SURGERY			English	Article						Intracapsular femoral neck fracture; Fracture-related treatments; Prognostic factors; Patients under the age of 60 years; Reduction and internal screw fixation	HIP FRACTURE; AVASCULAR NECROSIS; YOUNG-ADULTS; MORTALITY; COMPLICATIONS; SURGERY; DISPLACEMENT; FEMUR; DELAY; TIME	Purpose Regarding intracapsular femoral neck fractures, the main focus of research is the correlation between fracture-related complications and prognostic factors. To evaluate the correlation between complications required surgery (fracture-related treatment) and, among others, several less extensively investigated prognostic factors (day of surgery, co-morbidities, hospital type) in a 2-year period following internal fixation in patients under the age of 60 years with intracapsular femoral neck fracture. Methods A retrospective analysis of femoral neck fractures occurring in Hungary in 2000 was undertaken, based on data obtained from the National Health Insurance Fund Administration. The data were validated and completed by a questionnaire carried out in all of the 60 institutions enrolled. The effects of prognostic factors were analyzed by uni- and multivariate logistic regression in three groups: all fracture-related treatments and non-prosthetic (NPT) and prosthetic treatments (PT). Results Out of 413 patients, 17.9% required further fracture-related treatment. In 7.7% of patients, NPT and in 10.2% of patients, PT was performed. Fracture displacement (odds ratio [OR] = 2.24), weekend surgery (OR = 2.35), infections (OR = 3.68), central nervous system-related co-morbidities (OR = 3.64), and the county hospital level of management (OR = 2.36) were associated with significantly increased risk for further surgery. Conclusions To reduce the influence of risk factors, standardization of the substantive traumatologic and orthopedic professional guidelines, as well as the introduction of the "common orthopedic-trauma patient care" (British model) are suggested. To achieve high-quality standardized patient management, personal and material conditions are required to be accessible every day of the week. In the presence of co-morbidities, reduction of their harmful effects should be a major consideration by focusing on the patient in the peri-operative periods.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and current problems of allograft reconstruction techniques to optimize treatment strategies at our center.Materials and methodsThirty-eight cases (16 men and 22 women), who were diagnosed with malignant bone tumors and had undergone allograft reconstruction, were recruited. Allograft was fixed by intramedullary nail, single steel plate, double plate, and intramedullary nail combined plate in 2, 4, 17, and 15 cases, respectively. Allograft union, local recurrence, and complications were assessed with clinical and radiological tests. Tumor grade was assessed using the Enneking staging of malignant bone tumors. Functional prognosis was evaluated by the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) scoring system.ResultsIntercalary and osteoarticular reconstructions were performed in 32 and 6 cases, respectively. Six patients underwent reoperation related to allograft complications, four patients had local recurrence, and three patients with allograft fracture underwent allograft removal. A total of eight host-donor junctions showed nonunion, including seven cases (18.4%) in diaphysis and one case (3.1%) in metaphysis (p < 0.01). Host rejection and secondary osteoarthritis occurred in nine and two cases, respectively. No deep infection and internal fixation device fracture occurred. The overall allograft survival rate was 81.6%. Postoperative MSTS score of patients with allograft survival was 26.8 & PLUSMN; 2.9, indicating a significant improvement as compared to their preoperative function.ConclusionsAllograft represents an excellent choice for intercalary bone defects after malignant bone tumor resection. Robust internal fixation protection across the whole length of the allograft is an important prerequisite for the survival of the allograft, while multidimensional osteotomy, intramedullary cement reinforcement, and pedicled muscle flap transfer can effectively improve the survival rate and healing rate of the allograft.

The aim of this study is to determine the impact of combining titanium and stainless steel on bone healing and the clinical course of patients undergoing internal fixation of femoral fractures. Materials and Methods: 69 patients with femoral fractures had polyaxial locking plate osteosynthesis. The locking plate was made of a titanium alloy. Two different cohorts were defined: (a) sole plating and (b) additional stainless steel cerclage wiring. Postoperative radiographs and clinical followup were performed at 6 weeks, 3 months and 12 months. Results: Cohorts A and B had 36 and 33 patients, respectively. Patient demographics and comorbidities were similar in both groups. In two cases in cohort A, surgical revision was necessary. No complication could be attributed to the combination of titanium and stainless steel. Conclusion: The combination of stainless steel cerclage wires and titanium plates does not compromise fracture healing or the postoperative clinical course.

Internal fixation of complex fractures of the tarsal navicular with locking plates. A report of 10 cases	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Fracture; Navicular bone of the foot; Internal fixator; CT scan	FOOT	Introduction: Tarsal navicular fractures are rare and treatment of comminuted fractures is especially difficult. Since 2007, the authors have had access to 3D reconstruction from CT scan images and specific locking plates, and they decided to evaluate whether these elements improved management of these severe cases. Materials and methods: Between 2007 and 2011, 10 comminuted tarsal navicular fractures were treated in a prospective study. All of the fractures were evaluated by 3D reconstruction from CT scan images, with suppression of the posterior tarsal bones. The surgical approach was chosen according to the type of lesion. Reduction was achieved with a mini-distractor when necessary, and stabilized by AO locking plate fixation (Synthes (TM)). Patient follow-up included a clinical and radiological evaluation (Maryland Foot score, AOFAS score). Eight patients underwent postoperative CT scan. Results: All patients were followed up after a mean 20.5 months. Union was obtained in all patients and arthrodesis was not necessary in any of them. The mean Maryland Foot score was 92.8/100, and the AOFAS score 90.6/100. One patient with an associated comminuted calcaneal fracture had minimal sequella from a compartment syndrome of the foot. Discussion: The authors did not find any series in the literature that reported evaluating tarsal navicular fractures by 3D reconstruction from CT scan images. The images obtained after suppression of the posterior tarsal bones systematically showed a lateral plantar fragment attached to the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament, which is essential for stability, and which helped determine the reduction technique. Locking plate fixation of these fractures has never been reported. Conclusion: Comminuted fractures of the tarsal navicular were successfully treated with specific imaging techniques in particular 3D reconstructions of CT scan images to choose the surgical approach and the reduction technique. Locking plate fixation of the navicular seems to be a satisfactory solution for the treatment of these particularly difficult fractures. Level of evidence: Level IV. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

It supports localization of the region of interest, verification of the preoperatively classified fracture pattern, identification of correct insertion point of the implant, placement of instruments and fixation material, and verification of correct fracture reduction and implant positioning. While conventional fluoroscopic 2D imaging remains the gold standard in intraoperative imaging, critical anatomical regions are predestined for intraoperative 3D imaging. Additional options such as perioperative virtual planning, simulation, and surgical training, 3D printing techniques and 3D augmented reality visualization may potentially open new windows to improve surgical results in fracture care. This manuscript presents an update on current and upcoming imaging techniques in orthopaedic and trauma surgery focusing on technical advances for decreasing malreduction, malalignment, and malposition, as well as tips and tricks for daily surgical practice in order to improve clinical outcomes and patients' and surgeons' safety.

This study evaluated and compared the extent of malrotation and shoulder function after humeral shaft fractures treated operatively with IMN or ORIF. Materials and methods: Fifty humeral shaft fractures were randomly allocated into 2 groups. Group I underwent antegrade IMN and group II underwent ORIF. Malrotation was measured postoperatively by computed tomography scan (CT). Fracture union and functional outcomes were recorded at 12 months. Results: The final analysis comprised 45 patients. Group I had lower functional scores than group II (P < .05). Internal malrotation of 20 degrees or more (humeral head internally rotated) was found in 27.2% of group I patients, but there was no malrotation in group II. The internal and external range of motion of the involved shoulder was significantly correlated with the degree of malrotation (P < .01). Discussion: This study comprehensively evaluated the degree of malrotation using CT scanning for every patient. These data bring to light some unexpected results about poor shoulder function and degeneration after humeral shaft fracture. The study can provide baseline data for larger series and longer follow-up periods. Conclusions: Patients who underwent IMN had lower functional scores and a decreased range of motion postoperatively and also had a greater degree of malrotation than the ORIF group, which had none. The degree of malrotation correlated with a decreased range of motion and may possibly be a reason for degenerative arthritis at long-term follow-up.

Previously, orthopaedic implants were designed simply as mechanical devices; the biological aspects of the implant were a byproduct of stable internal/external fixation of the device to the surrounding bone or soft tissue. More recently, biologic coatings have been incorporated into orthopaedic implants in order to modulate the surrounding biological environment. This opinion article reviews current and potential future use of biologic coatings for orthopaedic implants to facilitate osseointegration and mitigate possible adverse tissue responses including the foreign body reaction and implant infection. While many of these coatings are still in the preclinical testing stage, bioengineers, material scientists and surgeons continue to explore surface coatings as a means of improving clinical outcome of patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery.

Materials and Methods: Ten patients treated operatively for a posteromedial talar body fractures entering both the subtalar and ankle articulations with a minimum of 1-year followup were identified from a trauma database. Age, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, time to surgery, complications, the range of motion, secondary procedures, and need for arthrodesis were evaluated. Results: Followup averaged 4.8 years (1-10). Eight of ten patients had high-energy mechanisms of injury. Six patients had associated medial subtalar dislocations with two open. Associated injuries were common. No surgical complications occurred. The range of motion was present but decreased. No arthrodesis procedures were performed. Conclusions: Operative fixation of posteromedial talus fractures with the described surgical technique resulted in acceptable outcomes in this series of patients with improved outcomes when compared to prior reports in the literature.

Materials and methods: Between 2005 and 2008, 15 patients with unilateral displaced proximal humeral shaft fractures were treated and followed up over a median period of 27 months (range, 12-38 months). The final follow-up included anteroposterior and lateral x-rays, range of shoulder motion, pain by visual analog scale (VAS), the Constant-Murley shoulder score, the Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Elbow (DASH) score, and the Short Form 36 (SF36) assessment. Results: No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. No secondary fracture displacement or radial neuropathy was observed postoperatively. One patient had open reduction and internal fixation for pseudoarthrosis 16 months after the initial surgery. At the final follow-up, the median range of motion of the operated shoulder was flexion, 145 degrees; extension, 45 degrees; internal rotation, 40 degrees; external rotation, 70 degrees; and abduction, 135 degrees. Median results on outcome assessments were VAS pain score, 0 points; Constant-Murley score, 74 points, representing 87.5% of the median Constant-Murley score of the unaffected shoulder; DASH score, 34 points, and the SF36, 83 points. Conclusion: Minimally invasive percutaneous plating with the PHILOS offers a valid option in the treatment of proximal humeral shaft fractures with comparable rates of nonunion and lower rates of radial neuropathy compared with open procedures. Furthermore, the results indicate that this method is associated with lower rates of wound infection and a shorter stay in the hospital for the patient.

MATERIAL and METHODS: Eight hundred and fifty (M/F:464/386) adult patients who underwent lower abdominal CT between January 2018 and December 2018 were evaluated retrospectively. One radiologist reviewed CT images of patient pelvises to assess the presence of open and closed PSIS. RESULTS: The mean age of all patients was 52.7 +/- 18 years. Of the 850 patients, 522 (61.5%) had open PSIS, while 328 (38.5%) had closed PSIS. The distribution of open and closed PSIS by gender was 57.5% and 42.5% in males and 66% and 34% in females, respectively. CONCLUSION: Overall, open PSIS is more common than closed PSIS. The closed PSIS is seen more often in males than in females. If an anteromedial sacral (S)-1 screw direction is chosen for posterior fusion with rod-screw fixation, it is essential to obtain CT images for evaluation of PSIS.

Percutaneous osteosynthesis of Galeazzi fracture-dislocation	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Elastic nail; intramedullary nail; Galeazzi fracture dislocation	FOREARM FRACTURES; MEDULLARY FIXATION; COMPRESSION-PLATE; RADIUS; ULNA; MANAGEMENT; MONTEGGIA; CHILDREN; LESIONS; SHAFT	Background: A Galeazzi fracture is defined as a fracture of the radius associated with dislocation of the distal radio-ulnar joint (DRUJ). The conventional surgical technique of nailing does not give enough stability and open reduction, internal fixation with the plate is associated with numerous complications. The stacked nailing for the management of these injuries provides adequate stability, maintains the relationship of the DRUJ and promotes uneventful union by closed technique. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the results of simple, user-friendly, low cost elastic stacked nailing for the management of Galeazzi fracture dislocation. Materials and Methods: We treated 22 young adults with fresh Galeazzi fracture-dislocation of the forearm, from January 2004 to January 2008, by percutaneous fixation of fracture by stacked elastic nailing at our institute. There were 19 males and three females and the age group ranged from 20-56 years (average 35 years). Surgery was performed within 48 to 72 hours under the guidance of image intensifier. Medullary cavity was filled with two elastic titanium nails having unequal lengths and diameter. One nail acts as a reduction nail and the other acts as a stabilizing nail. The results were evaluated using Mikic criteria based on union, alignment, relationship of the DRUJ, and movements at the inferior radio ulnar joint, elbow and wrist. Results: In six cases, following radiological union, nails in the radius were extracted between six to nine months after operation because of discomfort complained by the patient at site of insertion. After one year follow-up, 18 patients had excellent, four had fair results. Conclusion: Closed reduction and internal fixation of Galeazzi fracture by two elastic rods re-establishes the normal relationship of the fractured fragments and the DRUJ without repair of the ligaments. The stability is achieved by the flexibility and elasticity of the nails, crowding of the medullary canal and anchorage they gain in the radial diaphysis. Elastic nailing can produce excellent clinical results for Galeazzi fracture-dislocation. It has the advantages of technical simplicity, minimal cost, user-friendly instrumentation, and a short learning curve.	[Gadegone, Wasudeo M.; Salphale, Yogesh; Magarkar, D.

J	Grimshaw, CS; Bledsoe, JG; Moed, BR				Grimshaw, Charles S.; Bledsoe, J. Gary; Moed, Berton R.			Locked Versus Standard Unlocked Plating of the Pubic Symphysis: A Cadaver Biomechanical Study	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC TRAUMA			English	Article						symphyseal locked plating; locked plating; fixation failure	INTERNAL-FIXATION; PELVIC RING; FRACTURES; STABILITY; DISRUPTIONS; DIASTASIS; MOBILITY; 2-HOLE	Objectives: Although locked plating has been shown to have advantages for diaphyseal and metaphyseal fracture fixation, its benefits for pubic symphyseal disruption have not been established. With traditional plate fixation of the disrupted pubic symphysis, normal physiological symphyseal pelvic motion eventually results in plate breakage, screw breakage, and loosening of screws. A concern exists that common modes of locked plate construct failure could result in abrupt and complete loss of symphyseal fixation. The purposes of this study were to determine, using an open-book pelvic injury model, whether locked plating of the pubic symphysis 1) offers any advantage over standard unlocked plating; and 2) results in a potential increased risk of abrupt fixation failure. Methods: Twelve osteopenic cadaver pelvic specimens were acquired and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans were obtained to ensure uniformity of the specimens' bone density. Sacrospinous, sacrotuberous, and anterior sacroiliac ligaments were released and the symphysis pubis was transected to simulate a partially stable open book (AO/Orthopaedic Trauma Association 61-B3.1) injury. Using a six-hole 3.5-mm plate specifically designed for the symphysis pubis with the capability of fixation in locked or unlocked mode, six pelvises were fixed with locked screws and six pelvises were fixed standard unlocked bicortical screws. There was no significant difference between these 2 groups with regard to bone density (P = 0.47). Two equally osteopenic pelvic specimens from each fixation group were selected for the purpose of obtaining failure data and determining an acceptable load for trialing. Both specimens failed at 1985 N. The remaining 10 pelvises were then mounted on a materials testing apparatus using the bilateral stance model as described by Tile. In accordance with the failure data, each pelvis was stressed at 440 N for a total of one million cycles (equivalent to 6.5 months of daily walking) or until fixation failure. Results: All pelvic specimens in both fixation groups completed one million cycles without plate or screw failure. However, diastasis of the initial pubic symphysis reduction was found in all pelvises (mean, 2.45 mm; range, 1.5-4.0 mm) regardless of fixation method. This loss of reduction was not significantly different between the 2 fixation groups (P = 0.914). Conclusions: No abrupt failures occurred in either plating group. Consequently, any fear of catastrophic (ie, abrupt and complete) failure of locked symphyseal plates appears to be unfounded for open-book injuries treated in patients with low bone density. However, minor loss of the symphyseal reduction was evident in all pelvises regardless of the fixation method. Therefore, locked plating of the pubic symphysis does not appear to offer any advantage over the standard unlocked technique for an AO/Orthopaedic Trauma Association 61-B3.1 partially stable open-book pelvic injury pattern in osteopenic bone.

The present work illustrates the dynamization of an orthopaedic plate for internal fracture fixation which is thought to shorten healing times and enhance the quality of the new formed bone. The dynamization is performed wirelessly thanks to a magnetic coupling. The paper shows the peculiarities of the design and manufacturing of this system: it involves two components, sliding with respect to each other with an uncertain coefficient of friction, and with a specific compounded geometry; there are stringent limits on component size, and on the required activation energy. Finally, the device belongs to medical devices and, as such, it must comply with the respective regulation (EU 2017/745, ASTM F382). The design of the dynamizable fracture fixation plate has required verifying the dynamic of the unlocking mechanism through the development of a parametric multibody model which has allowed us to fix the main design variables. As a second step, the fatigue strength of the device and the static strength of the whole bone-plate system was evaluated by finite element analysis. Both analyses have contributed to defining the final optimized geometry and the constitutive materials of the plate; finally, the respective working process was set up and its performance was tested experimentally on a reference fractured femur. As a result of these tests, the flexural stiffness of the bone-plate system resulted equal to 370 N/mm, while a maximum bending moment equal to 75.3 kN center dot mm can be withstood without plate failure. On the whole, the performance of this dynamic plate was proved to be equal or superior to those measured for static plates already on the market, with excellent clinical results. At the same time, pre-clinical tests will be an interesting step of the future research, for which more prototypes are now being produced.

Surgical treatment of lateral clavicle fractures associated with complete coracoclavicular ligament disruption: Clinico-radiological outcomes of acromioclavicular joint sparing and spanning implants	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SHOULDER SURGERY			English	Article						Acromioclavicular joint; comminution; distal clavicle fracture; fracture patterns; hook plate; locking radius plate; ultrasound	DISTAL CLAVICLE; HOOK-PLATE; FIXATION; SHOULDER; TESTS; PAIN	Purpose: Distal clavicle fracture associated with complete coracoclavicular ligament disruption represents an unstable injury, and osteosynthesis is recommended. This study was performed (1) to retrospectively analyse the clinico-radiological outcomes of two internal fixation techniques, and (2) to identify and analyse radiographic fracture patterns of fracture that are associated with this injury. Materials and Methods: A total of 15 patients underwent osteosynthesis with either (1) acromioclavicular joint-spanning implants (Group 1, Hook plate device, n approximate to 10) or (2) joint-sparing implants (Group 2, distal radius plate, n = 5); these were reviewed at a mean period of 26.1 months (12 to 40 months). Clinical outcomes were measured using Constant Score (CS), Simple Shoulder Test (SST), and Walch ACJ score (WS). Radiographs and ultrasonography were used to assess the glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints, and the subacromial space. Preoperative radiographs were analyzed for assessment of fracture lines to identify radiographic patterns. Statistical analysis of the data was performed to determine any significant differences between the two groups. Results: The overall clinical outcome was satisfactory (CS 80.8, SST 11.3, WS 17.6) and a high union rate (93.3%) was observed. Radiographic complications (acromioclavicular degeneration and subluxation, hook migration, abnormal ossification) did not negatively influence the final clinical outcomes. Four distinct radiographic fracture patterns were observed. A statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) was observed in the reoperation rates between the two groups. Conclusions: Internal fixation of this fracture pattern is associated with a high union rate and favorable clinical outcomes with both techniques. A combination of distal radius plate and ligament reconstruction device resulted in stable fixation and significantly lower reoperation rates, and should be used when fracture geometry permits (Types 1 and 2). Design: Retrospective review of a consecutive clinical case series. Setting: Level 1 academic trauma service, Public Hospital.

Stability of radial head and neck fractures: A biomechanical study of six fixation constructs with consideration of three locking plates	JOURNAL OF HAND SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME			English	Article						stability; locking plates; osteosynthesis; radial head; radial neck	INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; RADIOCAPITELLAR JOINT; COMMINUTED FRACTURES; FORCE TRANSMISSION; ELBOW KINEMATICS; CONSTRAINTS; EXCISION; SIZE	Purpose: Open reduction and internal fixation of radial neck fractures can lead to secondary loss of reduction and nonunion due to insufficient stability. Nevertheless, there are only a few biomechanical studies about the stability achieved by different osteosynthesis constructs. Methods: Forty-eight formalin-fixed, human proximal radii were divided into 6 groups according to their bone density (measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry). A 2.7-mm gap osteotomy was performed to simulate an unstable radial neck fracture, which was fixed with 3 nonlocking implants: a 2.4-mm T plate, a 2.4-mm blade plate, and 2.0-mm crossed screws, and 3 locking plates: a 2.0-mm LCP T plate, a 2.0-mm 6x2 grid plate, and a 2.0-mm radial head plate. Implants were tested under axial (N/mm) and torsional (Ncm/degrees) loads with a servohydraulic materials testing machine. Results: The radial head plate was significantly stiffer than all other implants under axial as well as under torsional loads, with values of 36 N/mm and 13 Ncm/degrees. The second-stiffest implant was the blade plate, with values of 20 N/mm and 6 Ncm/degrees. The weakest implants were the 2.0-mm LCP, with values of 6 N/mm and 2 Ncm/degrees, and the 2.0-mm crossed screws, with values of 18 N/mm and 2 Ncm/degrees. The 2.4-mm T plate, with values of 14 N/mm and 4 Ncm/degrees, and the 2.0-mm grid plate, with values of 8 N/mm and 4 Ncm/degrees came to lie in the midfield. Conclusions: The 2.0-mm angle-stable plates-depending on their design-allow fixation with comparable or even higher stability than the bulky 2.4-mm nonlocking implants and 2.0-mm crossed screws.

This study examines the functional outcomes and complications related to hindfoot nails (HFN) in geriatric patients who have suffered an ankle malleolar or distal tibia fracture.Materials and MethodsThis is a single-surgeon case-series of patients who underwent HFN for acute fixation or delayed reconstruction after an ankle or distal tibia fracture. Demographic information, comorbidities, baseline functional status, AO/OTA classification, surgical indications, need for external fixation, total operative time, length of stay (LOS), ambulation at discharge, and discharge disposition were recorded. Primary outcomes included 30-day complications, ambulation at follow-up, and time to fracture union and fusion.ResultsThere were 22 patients, with average age 80.8 years. Mean LOS was 7.0 days, and 68.2% were discharged to subacute rehabilitation. Within 30 days, 1 patient developed a deep vein thrombosis and bilateral pulmonary emboli, and 2 experienced wound dehiscence requiring antibiotics. At 6-weeks, 1 patient sustained a fall with periprosthetic fracture requiring HFN revision, and another developed cellulitis necessitating hardware removal. Fracture healing was seen in 72.7% at 19.4 weeks, while radiographic fusion occurred in 18.2% at 43.0 weeks. 72.7% were ambulating with an assistive device at discharge, and 100.0% at 12-weeks post-operatively or last follow-up. Upon final examination, all patients were ambulating without pain.DiscussionHFNs provide a reliable alternative to traditional open reduction internal fixation and have the ability to improve quality of life for geriatric patients through a faster return to weight-bearing. Additionally, radiographic fusion rates show that patients have favorable functional outcomes even without formal arthrodesis.ConclusionHFN is beneficial for elderly patients with low functional demand and complex medical comorbidities, as it allows for early mobility after sustaining an ankle or distal tibia fracture.

Materials and Methods: Twenty-five polyurethane mandibles were used as substrates, fixed with a 2-mm fixation system, and divided into 5 groups: I, 1 4-hole plate, without intermediate space, in the neutral zone of the mandibular body and another similar plate in the external oblique ridge of the contralateral mandibular angle; II, 1 6-hole plate, with intermediate space, in the neutral zone of the mandibular body and a similar plate in the external oblique ridge of the left mandibular angle; III, 1 4-hole locking plate, with intermediate space, in the right neutral zone and another similar plate in the left external oblique ridge; IV, 2 4-hole plates, with intermediate space, one in the tension zone and the other in the compression zone of the mandibular body, and 1 4-hole plate, with intermediate space, in the external oblique ridge of the contralateral mandibular angle; V, 2 4-hole plates with intermediate space, one in the tension zone and the other in the compression zone of the mandibular body and similarly in the buccal side of the left mandibular angle. Mandibles were subjected to vertical linear load tests by a mechanical testing machine (Instron 4411, Instron Corp, Norwood, MA) to record peak load and load for displacements of 3, 5, and 7 mm. Results: Group I had the least mechanical resistance of all groups, regardless of displacement, and group IV had the greatest mechanical resistance. Among groups II, III, and V, there was no statistically meaningful difference. Conclusion: Fixation of bilateral mandibular fractures involving the mandibular angle and body using 2 plates in the region of the body and 1 plate in the tension zone in the region of the mandibular angle was the technique that presented the best mechanical resistance.

JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							RIGID INTERNAL-FIXATION; MANDIBULAR CONDYLE; OPEN REDUCTION; SURGICAL COMPLICATIONS; SUBCONDYLAR FRACTURES; NECK FRACTURES; METAANALYSIS; SYSTEM; PLATES	Purpose: The retromandibular transparotid approach (RMA) to condylar fractures of the mandible provides excellent access, but can increase the risk of complications. The aim of this studywas to estimate the frequency of facial nerve paralysis (FNP) and associated postoperative complications after open reduction and rigid internal fixation (ORIF) of subcondylar fractures through the RMA. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with condylar fractures requiring ORIF through the RMA. The inclusion criteria were 1) a medical record of surgical treatment of a subcondylar fracture by RMA; 2) preoperative and postoperative radiographs; 3) mental status permitting an adequate neuromotor examination; 4) absence of a post-injury or pretreatment functional facial nerve deficit; and 5) regular postoperative follow-up longer than 6 months with documentation of complications, functional results, and fixation stability. The predictive variables were age, gender, fracture site, fracture pattern, concomitant fractures, etiology, and plate types. The outcome variable was FNP. Univariate, bivariate, and multiple logistic regression statistics were computed. Results: Fifty patients with 55 displaced mandibular subcondylar fractures (35 men, 15 women; mean age, 44.5 yr; range, 17 to 87 yr) met the inclusion criteria. The condylar fracture involved the neck in 35 patients (63.6%) and the base in 20 patients (36.4%). The fracture pattern was deviation in 11 patients (20.0%), displacement in 23 (41.8%), and dislocation in 21 (38.2%). Precise ORIF with double-buttress fixation resulted in immediate functional recovery in all patients. Seven fractures (12.7%) were associated with FNP that resolved completely within 6months. Further statistical analysis showed that dislocated and displaced condylar neck fractures were significant risk factors for postoperative FNP (P <.05). Other postoperative complications were minimal. Conclusion: The RMA for subcondylar fractures is feasible and safe. Dislocated condylar neck fractures are associated with a highly increased risk of temporary postoperative FNP as a surgical complication.

Fibular Autograft as Medial Support with Proximal Humerus Locking Plate Construct in Comminuted Proximal Humerus Fractures: A Retrospective Analysis	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Proximal humerus fracture; Comminuted; PHILOS; Intramedullary fibula; Autograft	STRUT GRAFT AUGMENTATION; FIXATION; REDUCTION; OUTCOMES	BackgroundVarus collapse is one of the pivotal mechanisms of failure following surgical fixation of proximal humerus fractures. The aim of the present study was to evaluate functional and radiological outcomes of non-vascularized fibular autograft as medial support with locking plate construct for comminuted proximal humerus fractures (PHF's).Materials and methodsWe retrospectively evaluated 18 patients with unstable PHF's in the age group 50-70 years with a minimum follow-up of two years. All the fracture patterns were classified according to Resch, Neer's and AO classification and either medial calcar compromise or comminution were present in all. Open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) with a locking plate was performed for all the patients along with intramedullary fibular autograft to support medial calcar. Radiological outcome was assessed by neck-shaft angle (NSA) graded according to the Paavolainen grading method and difference in the humeral head height (HHH). Functional outcome was assessed by shoulder range of motion (ROM), University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) score and American shoulder and elbow surgeons score (ASES).ResultsRadiological union at the fracture site was achieved in all the patients at mean of 8 months (range 6-12 months). Range of movements were mean flexion of 123.89, extension 35.28, internal rotation 66.94, external rotation 57.78 and abduction of 115 & DEG; at final follow-up. The average NSA was in the range of 120 & DEG;-130 & DEG; and none of the patients showed difference in HHH of & GE; 4 mm in the immediate post-operative radiograph and that taken on final follow-up. The functional outcome assessed by ASES score (mean 89.44) and UCLA score (mean 29.61) suggested fair to good results. None of the patients has shown varus collapse and avascular necrosis. Neither there were any complications related to the donor area.ConclusionsIn unstable proximal humerus fractures with calcar comminution or void, PHILOS plate fixation augmented with fibular autograft as a medial support reduces varus collapse and promotes early radiological union.

The purpose of this study was to biomechanically compare a new non-bridging external fixator construct to volar angular stable plate fixation in a dorsally comminuted intra-articular fracture model of the distal radius. Materials and methods: Five pairs of fresh frozen human cadaveric radii were randomly supplied with either a non-bridging external fixator or a stainless steel volar locking plate. A three-fragmental AO 23-C2.1 fracture was created by removing a 15 degrees dorsal wedge with remaining volar cortical contact and by an intra-articular osteotomy lateral to the lister-tubercle. Physiological load transfer via the wrist was simulated by means of a custom-made seesaw. For biomechanical testing, the bones were loaded in cyclic axial compression. Starting at 100 N. the load was monotonically increased at 0.025 degrees N per cycle until failure of the construct. Motion of the lunate and scaphoid fragments with respect to the radial diaphysis was acquired by optical three-dimensional (3D) motion tracking. Plastic wedge deformation was determined after 2000, 4000 and 6000 cycles. Results: The amplitude of wedge motion at the beginning of the test as a measure for construct stiffness was significantly lower for the fixator group (P = 0.003, power = 0.99). Plastic wedge deformation after 2000, 4000 and 6000 cycles was found significantly lower for the external fixator (repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), P = 0.009, power = 0.86). Displacement of the intra-articular gap was found below 0.6 mm (mean) for both groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The study revealed Superior biomechanical properties of the proposed non-bridging external fixation compared to volar locked plating in an unstable intra-articular fracture model with volar cortical support. However, both fixation techniques seem to apply sufficient stabilisation to restore and retain anatomy after fracture of the most distal part of the radius and should be individually chosen according to distinct criteria.

Osteosynthesis of ununited femoral neck fracture by internal fixation combined with iliac crest bone chips and muscle pedicle bone grafting	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Femoral neck fracture; muscle pedicle bone graft; nonunionMeSH terms: Femoral neck fractures; grafting; bone; osteonecrosis; osteosynthesis	TRANSCERVICAL FRACTURES; ASEPTIC NECROSIS; HEAD; FEMUR; NONUNION; MANAGEMENT; YOUNGER; ADULTS	Background: Ununited femoral neck fracture is seen commonly in developing countries due to delayed presentation or failure of primary internal fixation. Such fractures, commonly present with partial or total absorption of femoral neck, osteonecrosis of femoral head in 8-30% cases with upward migration of trochanter posing problem for osteosynthesis, especially in younger individuals. Several techniques for treatment of such conditions are described like osteotomies or nonvascularied cortical or cancellous bone grafting provided varying degrees of success in terms of fracture union but unsatisfactory long term results occurred due to varying incidence of avascular necrosis (AVN) of femoral head. Moreover, in presence of AVN of femoral head neither free fibular graft nor cancellous bone graft is satisfactory. The vascularied bone grafting by deep circumflex iliac artery based on iliac crest bone grafting, free vascularied fibular grafting and muscle pedicle periosteal grafting showed high incidence of success rate. Osteosynthesis is the preferred treatment of choice in ununited femoral neck fracture in younger individuals. Materials and Methods: Of the 293 patients operated during the period from June 1977 to June 2009, 42 were lost to followup. Seven patients with gluteus medius muscle pedicle bone grafting (MPBG) were excluded. Thus, out of 244 patients, 208 (85.3%) untreated nonunion and 36 (14.7%) following failure of primary internal fixation were available for studies. Time interval between the date of injury and operation in untreated nonunion cases was mean 6.5 months and in failed internal fixation cases was mean 11.2 months. Ages of the patients varied from 16 to 55 years. Seventy patients had partial and 174 had subtotal absorption of the femoral neck. Evidence of avascular necrosis (AVN) femoral head was found histologically in 135 (54.3%) and radiologically in 48 (19.7%) patients. The patients were operated by open reduction of fracture, cannulated hip screw fixation, iliac crest bone chips and quadratus femoris MPBG. Results: The mean followup is 12.5 years (range 3-35). The union of fractures occurred in 202 (82.8%), delayed union in 18 (7.3%), and established nonunion in 24 (9.8%) patients. Full weight bearing was permitted at 16-22 weeks after union of fractures. Mean Harris hip score at the longest followup was 85.5. Among the complications, superficial wound infection occurred in 20 (8.2%), deep infection in seven (2.9%), and coxa vara in 39 (16%) patients. Preoperative radiodensity of femoral head disappeared mostly after the union of fracture whereas fresh radiodensity of femoral head appeared in 20 (8%) patients; nine (45%) of them developed segmental collapse. Conclusion: Ununited femoral neck fractureis characterized by absorption of femoral neck, posterior cortical defect, smoothening and overriding of fracture surfaces with intervening fibrous tissues associated with or without AVN of femoral head. The above method of osteosynthesis rectified the above pathology and provided satisfactory results with union of fractures in 90.1% patients at long term followup.	[Baksi, D.

Specifically, the screw type, the thickness and material of the locking plate, the gap between two femoral fragments (fracture gap) and the distance between bone and plate (interface gap) were evaluated during a human walking. We found that the patient-specific locking plate possessed greater mechanical strength and more efficient fracture healing than the corresponding traditional plate. An optimal patient-specific femoral locking plate would consist of bicortical locking screws, Ti-6Al-4V material and 4.75-mm plate thickness with a fracture gap of 2mm and an interface gap of 1mm. The developed patient-specific femoral locking plate based on the patient-specific musculoskeletal mechanical environment was more beneficial to fracture rehabilitation and healing. The patient-specific design method provides an effective research platform for designing and optimizing the patient-specific femoral locking plate under realistic in vivo walking conditions, which can be extended to the design of other implants as well as to other physiological loading conditions related to various daily activities.

The principles of treatment include respect for the soft tissues, restoring the congruity of the articular surface and reduction of the anatomic alignment of the lower limb to enable early movement of the knee joint. There are various surgical fixation methods that can achieve these principles of treatment. Recognition of the particular fracture pattern is important, as this guides the surgical approach required in order to adequately stabilize the fracture. This study evaluates the results of the combined treatment of external fixator and limited internal fixation along with the advantages using postoperative computed tomography (CT) scan after implant removal. Materials and Methods: 55 patients with a mean age of 42 years (range 17-65 years) with tibial plateau fracture, were managed in our institution between October 2010 and September 2013., Twenty fractures were classified as Schatzker VI and 35 as Schatzker V. There were 8 open fractures (2 Gustilo Anderson 3A and 6 Gustilo Anderson 2). All fractures were treated with closed reduction and hybrid external fixation (n = 21/38.2%) or with minimal open reduction internal fixation and a hybrid system (n = 34/61.8%). After the removal of the fixators, CT-scan was programmed for all the cases, for correlation with the results. At final followup, the American Knee Society Score (AKSS) was administered. Results: All patients were evaluated with a minimum of 12 months (range 12-21 months) followup. Average time to union was 15.5 weeks (range 13-19 weeks). The postoperative joint congruity as evaluated in the postoperative CT-scan was <2 mm of articular step-off in 8 patients (14.5%), between 2 and 4 mm in 18 patients (32.7%) and over 4 mm in 29 (52.7%). The injured limb mechanical axis was restored within 5 degrees compared to the contralateral limb in 36 cases (65%) and with an angulation >5 degrees in 19 cases (35%). Patients with residual joint depression <3.5 mm had a 95% chance of having excellent AKSS knee score results and 80% chance of having excellent AKSS function scores. On the other hand, residual joint depression of >4.5 mm displayed a 100% chance of getting poor-fair scores both in AKSS knee and AKSS function score. The association of a postoperative mechanical axis within 5 degrees of the contralateral limb and improved knee scores was statistically significant for the AKSS function and total scores but not for the AKSS knee score. The AKSS was negatively correlated with postoperative joint depression magnitude which was statistically significant. Only the amount of joint collapse was verified as a prognostic factor in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: The postoperative CT-scan shows important information about bone healing, and an exact image of the reduction and the shaft alignment. Postoperative radiographs may have led to an underestimation of the degree of residual displacement. On the contrary, CT-scan demonstrates the exact grade of articular displacement and depending on CT-scan results one can better manage the postoperative rehabilitation.

Method: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term mechanical behavior and osteogenetic capabilities of a biocomposite anchor injection molded with 30% beta-tricalcium phosphate microparticles blended with 70% poly (L-lactide-co-glycolide) (85/15). This study investigated in vitro degradation and in vivo bone formation in a canine model. The initial mechanical behavior, mechanical strength retention with degradation time, and degradation features were investigated. Results: The results showed that the biocomposite anchor had sufficient initial mechanical stability confirmed by comparing the initial shear load on the anchor with the minimum shear load borne by an ankle fracture fixation screw, which is considered a worst-case implantation site for mechanical loading. The maximum shear load retention of the biocomposite anchor was 83% at 12 weeks, which is desirable, as it aligns with the rate of bone healing. The beta-tricalcium phosphate fillers were evenly dispersed in the polymeric matrix and acted to slow the degradation rate and improve the mechanical strength of the anchor. The interface characteristics between the beta-tricalcium phosphate particles and the polymeric matrix changed the degradation behavior of the biocomposite. Phosphate buffer saline was shown to diffuse through the interface into the biocomposite to inhibit the core accelerated degradation rate. In vivo, the addition of beta-tricalcium phosphate induced new bone formation. The biocomposite material developed in this study demonstrated improved osteogenesis in comparison to a plain poly (L-lactide-co-glycolide) material. Neither anchor produced adverse tissue reactions, indicating that the biocomposite had favorable biocompatibility following long-term implantation. Conclusion: In summary, the new biocomposite anchor presented in this study had favorable osteogenetic capability, mechanical property, and controlled degradation rate for bone fixation. Translational potential of this article: The new biocomposite anchor had sufficient initial and long-term fixation stability and bone formation capability in the canine model. It is indicated that the new biocomposite anchor has a potential for orthopedic application.

Evaluated in chemical fixation of CO, with epoxides into cyclic carbonates in the absence of any solvent and basic additive, the nanoporous copolymer catalyst showed high and stable activity, superior to various control catalysts including the halogen-containing analogue. Further, high yields were obtained over a wide scope of substrates including aliphatic long carbon-chain alkyl epoxides and internal epoxide, even under atmospheric pressure and less than 100 degrees C for the majority of the substrates. On the basis of in situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) investigation and density functional theory (DFT) calculation for the reaction intermediates, we proposed a possible reaction mechanism accounting for the superior catalytic activity of the ionic copolymer. The specifically prepared ionic copolymer material of this work features highly stable, noncorrosive, and sustainable catalysis and, thus, may be a new possibility for efficient chemical fixation of CO, since it is an environmentally friendly, metal -free solid catalyst.

Negative pressure wound therapy with instillation and dwell time (NPWTi-d) is an emerging therapy for the treatment of complex wounds, including infected wounds with osteosynthetic material. The purpose of this case study was to evaluate the outcomes of 4 patients (1 man, 3 women; age range 49 to 71 years) with a postoperative wound infection (POWI) following fracture repair and internal fixation. All patients were at high risk for surgical complications, including infections. Standard infection treatments (antibiotics) had been unsuccessful. Based on the available literature, a NPWTi-d protocol was developed. Following surgical debridement, wounds were instilled with polyhexanide biguanide with a set dwell time of 15 minutes, followed by continuous NPWTi-d of -125 mm Hg for 4 hours. The system was changed every 3 to 4 days until sufficient granulation tissue was evident and negative pressure without instillation could be used. Systemic antibiotics were continued in all patients. Granulation tissue was found to be sufficient in 12 to 35 days in the 4 cases, no recurrence of infection was noted, and the osteosynthesis material remained in place. No adverse events were observed. Research is needed to compare the safety and effectiveness of this adjunct treatment in the management of challenging wounds to other patient and wound management approaches.

Our aim was to compare the clinical and radiological outcomes between volar plating (VP) and external fixation (IT) for distal intraarticular radius fractures two years postoperatively. Materials and methods: This retrospective study included 59 patients with 62 intraarticular AO Type C distal radius fractures. We distinguished two groups: patients treated with internal fixation (volar locking plate, VP group: 41 fractures), and patients treated with an external fixator and K-wires (EF group: 21 fractures). The clinical assessment included range of motion, grip strength, disability of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH), and visual analog scale scores. Radiological measurements comprised flexion and extension, radial volar tilt, inclination, height, shortening, and ulnar variance. Results: Postoperative grip strength and flexion angles were better after VP (P = 0.004, P = 0.009), but there was no difference in DASH scores (P = 0.341). Radial inclination was significantly different compared to that of the uninjured hand after VP (P 0.0183), but not EP (P 0.11). Conclusion: VP and EP result in similar clinical and radiological outcomes after 2 years. Function is not restored to the functionality of the contralateral and noninjured hand.

Because of the low incidence, the characteristics of the fracture in different studies have not been consistent. We describe our clinical experience with this fracture type. Materials and Methods: From January 2007 to December 2009, 12 patients were identified with a trimalleolar fracture with involvement of entire posterior tibial plafond. All the fractures were openly reduced and fixed through a combined operative approach (posterolateral and posteromedial). Ten of 12 patients were followed up. The clinical outcome was assessed with the Short Form-36 (SF-36) and standardized AAOS foot and ankle questionnaire, and the radiological evaluation with an osteoarthritis-score (OA-score). Results: Based on the pathoanatomy of the posteromedial malleolar fragment, all the fractures could be classified into two types. Using a combined operative approach, anatomical reduction and stable fixation was accomplished in all 12 patients. At a mean followup of 18.9 (range, 12 to 30) months, 10 patients achieved a good radiological result and satisfactory clinical recovery. Conclusion: This fracture pattern may be classified into two types with different injury mechanisms, which has not been described previously. After anatomic reduction and stable fixation through a combined operative approach, the short-term outcome was good.

Material/Methods: A novel aiming device was designed and manufactured. Between January 2010 and June 2012, 64 femoral neck fracture patients were included into the study. All 64 patients were divided into 2 groups randomly. The aiming device was used during the operation for patients in the experimental group, but not in the control group. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in operative time or bleed volume between the groups (P>0.05). The frequency of guidewire drilling was significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group (P<0.05). The angle between the first cannulated screw and the central axis of the femoral neck in coronal plane and sagittal plane, and the distance between the bottom cannulated screw and the medial calcar femorale rim, were significantly smaller in the experimental group than in the control group (P<0.05). Conclusions: The aiming device is simple in structure and easy to use. It could help surgeons to accurately insert cannulated screw guidewires. The aiming device is suitable for broad clinical use.

Materials and methods: The trials were carried out on seven fresh frozen cadaver specimens. The distal tibiofibular syndesmosis widening was investigated using Roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis, in intact and ligament injured ankles and after the fixation of the syndesmotic screw. The AO-ASIF recommendations were followed for screw implant. Results: Injury to the syndesmotic and deltoid ligaments of the ankle did not result in a significant variation of the syndesmosis behavior during passive foot flexion. The 4.5-mm diameter cortical screw used in this study proved effective in restraining mortise width variation during foot flexion. The recorded mortise widening in the flexion arc extending from the neutral to the maximally dorsiflexed position was negligible in intact and ligament injured joints. Conclusion: The result does not endorse the recommendation of placing the foot in full dorsal flexion during screw implantation. The choice of screw fixation as a treatment for ankle syndesmosis disruption should be carefully evaluated.

Study Design: A prospective, single-arm, four-centre study. Material and Methods: A total of 46 patients with 46 humeral fractures classified as 12 A-B were treated with a novel CFR-PEEK IMN and followed for 12 months. Results: Most of the patients (65%) were female; the mean age was 65 +/- 17 years. The average operating time was 66.75 +/- 19.84 minutes and X-ray exposure was 104.11 +/- 98.01 seconds. All patients postoperatively reported self-limiting shoulder pain and three patients developed iatrogenic transient radial palsy. Two patients required repositioning of the implant. No implant-related complications were observed. Radiological consolidation was achieved in all 43 patients who completed the 12-month follow-up. Conclusions: The CFR-PEEK IMN is user-friendly and safe. Its bone-matching elastic modulus seems to contribute to its clinical efficacy. This, together with compatibility with modern imaging techniques, can be considered a further evolution of IMN designed to stabilise humeral shaft fractures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of extrusion, incorporation of hydroxyapatite (HA) and selfreinforced composites (SRCs) on the resultant mechanical properties of PLLA were examined. Samples were conditioned for up to 52 weeks in PBS at 37 degrees C. Extrusion did not adversely affect the mechanical properties of PLLA. After in vitro conditioning, a slight but significant reduction in the strain to failure and modulus was seen. HA (10-40%) by weight was evenly distributed into PLLA using an intermeshing twin-screw extruder. As ceramic content increased, the initial modulus increased but flexural strength decreased. After immersion, the modulus of all HA-PLLA blends was lower than PLLA. HA particles did not form a strong bond with the PLLA, which promoted easier degradation of the HA-PLLA matrix. SRCs showed a higher modulus and strength when compared to all materials except the modulus of 30 and 40% HA-PLLA composites before immersion. Water preferentially attacked the matrix of the composite, leading to more fiber pullout, but the fiber orientation maintained the advantages in strength and modulus up to 24 weeks in vitro.

Reamed and unreamed surgical procedures are commonly used to attach IM nails to fractured bones. It is believed that the use of flexible composites contributes to successful fracture healing because of the desirable initial interfragmentary movement (IFM) provided by the material. This finite element study was conducted to understand the influence of initial IFM on the healing process by using various IM nail materials (stainless steel, carbon/epoxy composites (WSN3k [0](2nT), WSN3k [+/- 30](nT)) and glass/polyprophylene (Twintex [0](2nT) composite). Reamed and unreamed IM nails were used to investigate the effects of mesenchymal cell activities, deviatoric strain, and body fluid flow in calluses on bone healing. The results showed that unreamed IM nails promoted healing because of a 40% increase in initial cells supplied to the central callus, compared to reamed nails. The most suitable initial interfragmentary strains (IFS) (18.3% and 6.85%, reamed and unreamed) were provided by the flexible Twintex [0](2nT) IM nail and this induced 38% and 40.33% healing performances by the reamed and unreamed IM nails, respectively.

Methods Sixty-one patients with OPLL were divided into Group A (posterior surgery with laminectomy of the responsible segment and lateral mass screw fixation) and Group B (anterior cervical corpectomy with intervertebral titanium cage fusion). Neurological function was assessed by the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, visual analog scale (VAS) score, and recovery rate. The fixation status and the result of spinal canal decompression were radiographically assessed. Results In Groups A and B, the JOA score was significantly higher and the VAS score was significantly lower at 1 week postoperatively and at the final follow-up than during the preoperative period. The mean recovery rate in Group A and B was 59.92% +/- 13.46% and 62.28% +/- 14.00%, respectively. Postoperative radiographs showed good positioning and no damage to the internal fixation materials. The spinal canal was also fully decompressed. Conclusions Microscopically assisted decompression with a micro-hook scalpel in both anterior and posterior surgeries achieved good clinical effects in patients with OPLL.

The aim of the present study is to assess the results of Ilizarov external fixator in management of infected nonunion of the distal third humerus. Material and methods: Twenty-three patients with infected nonunion of the distal humerus were included in this study. The ages ranged from 19 to 58 years with an average of 35 years. Seventeen cases were males and 6 were females. All patients were treated by radical debridement and application of Ilizarov external fixator in one stage surgery. Results: Bony union was achieved in all cases. Bone graft was required in 12 patients with hypotrophic nonunion. The external fixation time ranged from 4 to 9 months with an average of 5.6 months. Infection was controlled in all cases without recurrence during the period of follow up. The complications included pin tract infection in 7 cases, radial nerve injury in one case, elbow stiffness in 4 cases and refracture after frame removal in one case. Conclusion: Ilizarov external fixator is effective in management of infected nonunion of the distal humerus. The thin tensioned wires produce good grip in the small or osteoporotic bone fragments.

J	Nag, P; Chanda, S				Nag, Pratik; Chanda, Souptick			A preclinical model of post-surgery secondary bone healing for subtrochanteric femoral fracture based on fuzzy interpretations	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FINITE-ELEMENT-ANALYSIS; TISSUE DIFFERENTIATION; MECHANICAL STABILITY; INTERNAL-FIXATION; LOCKING PLATES; STRESS; GAP; COMPRESSION; VASCULARIZATION; SIMULATION	Mechanobiology plays an essential role in secondary bone fracture healing. While the introduction of newer type of plates, e.g. locking plate (LP), is becoming increasingly popular for complex femoral fractures, the conventional technique involving dynamic compression plate (DCP) remains the standard choice. The difference between the two techniques lies primarily in their screw fixation mechanisms. The present study applied 3D dynamic fracture healing scheme modelled on a subtrochanteric femur fracture, regulated by both finite element (FE) analysis and Fuzzy logic control in order to understand the spatio-temporal healing phenomena for both LP and DCP. The study further examined the influence of the two screw fixation mechanisms in determining the comparative progression of fracture healing. The problem was solved iteratively in several healing steps running in loop and accordingly, the local tissue concentrations and material properties were updated. The predicted results accorded well with various previous experimental observations. The study found an initial delay in healing associated with DCP. However, as the healing progressed, there was no significant difference in overall callus modulus. The presented preclinical model may further help predict bone healing for different implantation techniques, and thus can serve as a non-invasive tool for evaluating relative merits of extramedullary plating techniques.

Thus, polishing the surface of these implants is expected to have significant clinical benefit in certain situations. The aim of the present study was to determine if polishing the surface of an IFF device influences susceptibility to infection. The local infection rate associated with 4-hole 2.0 mm Synthes (R) locking compression plates (LCPs) composed of clinically available commercially pure titanium (cpTi) and titanium aluminium niobium (TAN) in their standard microrough form was compared with that of their test polished equivalents and also to clinically available electropolished stainless steel (EPS). The LCPs were fixed in locking mode onto the tibia of mature, female New Zealand White rabbits and a clinical strain of Staphylococcus aureus was added to the implantation site. Twenty eight days after surgery the rabbits were euthanized and assessed for infection. The rank order based on descending ID50 was; polished TAN, standard TAN, standard cpTi, EPS and finally polished cpTi, however, the ID50 values did not differ greatly between the groups with the same material. Using the LCP model in locking mode, polishing the surface of both cpTi and TAN was not found to influence the susceptibility to infection in our animal model.

This study is the first to assess the bone regenerative potential of osteoconductive u-HA/PLLA material when it is used for repairing maxillofacial bone defects. A total of 21 Sprague-Dawley male rats were divided into three groups-the u-HA/PLLA, PLLA, or sham control groups. A critical size defect of 4 mm was created in the mandible of each rat. Then, the defect was covered with either a u-HA/PLLA or PLLA sheet on the buccal side. The rats in each group were sacrificed at 2, 4, or 8 weeks. The rats' mandibles were sampled for histological analysis with hematoxylin and eosin staining, histomorphometry, and immunohistochemistry with Runx2 and osteocalcin (OCN) antibody. The amount of newly formed bone in the u-HA/PLLA group was significantly higher than that of the PLLA group. The expression of Runx2 and OCN in the u-HA/PLLA group was also significantly higher. These results demonstrate that the u-HA/PLLA material has excellent bone regenerative ability and confirm its applicability as a reconstructive device in maxillofacial surgery.

Quantitative contrast enhanced dual energy CT to predict avascular necrosis: a feasibility study of proximal humerus fractures	BMC MEDICAL IMAGING			English	Article						Dual energy computed tomography; Iodine map; Avascular necrosis; Ischemia; Bone; Fracture	FEMORAL-HEAD PERFUSION; BONE NECROSIS; IODINE; OSTEONECROSIS; VASCULARITY; FIXATION; PART; NECK; DISCRIMINATION; CLASSIFICATION	Background Avascular necrosis is a delayed complication of proximal humerus fractures that increases the likelihood of poor clinical outcomes. CT scans are routinely performed to guide proximal humerus fracture management. We hypothesized iodine concentration on post-contrast dual energy CT scans identifies subjects who develop avascular necrosis and ischemia due to compromised blood flow. Materials and methods 55 patients with proximal humerus fractures enrolled between 2014 and 2017 underwent clinical, radiographic and contrast enhanced dual energy CT assessment. Iodine densities of the humeral head and the glenoid (control) were measured on CT. Subjects managed with open reduction internal fixation or conservatively (non-surgical) were followed for up to two years for radiographic evidence of avascular necrosis. Arthroplasty subjects underwent histopathologic evaluation for ischemia of the resected humeral head. Results 17 of 55 subjects (30.9%) were treated conservatively, 21 (38.2%) underwent open reduction internal fixation and 17 of 55 (30.9%) underwent arthroplasty. Of the 38 subjects treated conservatively or with ORIF, 20 (52.6%) completed 12 months of follow up and 14 (36.8%) 24 months of follow up. At 12 months follow up, two of 20 subjects (10%) and at 24 months 3 of 14 subjects (21.4%) developed avascular necrosis. At 12 months, the mean humerus/glenoid iodine ratio was 1.05 (standard deviation 0.24) in subjects with AVN compared to 0.91 (0.24) in those who did not. At 24 months, subjects with avascular necrosis had a mean humerus/glenoid iodine concentration ratio of 1.06 (0.17) compared to 0.924 (0.21) in those who did not. Of 17 arthroplasty subjects, 2 had severe ischemia and an iodine ratio of 1.08 (0.30); 5 had focal ischemia and a ratio of 1.00 (0.36); and 8 no ischemia and a ratio of 0.83 (0.08). Conclusions Quantifying iodine using dual energy CT in subjects with proximal humerus fractures is technically feasible. Preliminary data suggest higher humeral head iodine concentration may increase risk of avascular necrosis; however, future studies must enroll and follow enough subjects managed with open reduction internal fixation or conservatively for two or more years to provide statistically significant results.

Locking plate fixation versus antegrade nailing of 3-and 4-part proximal humerus fractures in patients without osteoporosis. Comparative retrospective study of 63 cases	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Shoulder; Proximal humerus fractures 3-and 4 part fractures; Locking plates; Intramedullary nailing	INTRAMEDULLARY FIBULAR ALLOGRAFT; ANGULAR STABLE PLATE; TELEGRAPH NAIL; POLARUS NAIL; COMPLICATIONS; SHOULDER; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; SURGERY; FAILURE	Introduction: There is no consensus on the treatment of proximal humeral fractures. The goal of the present retrospective observational study was to compare functional and radiological results and complications of internal fixation using locking plates versus antegrade nailing in the treatment of non-osteoporotic Neer classification 3- and 4-part fractures after a least 1 year of follow-up. Material and methods: Internal fixation was performed in 67 fractures (1 bilateral): 35 by locking plate (1 lost to follow-up, 1 deceased) and 32 by intramedullary nailing (2 lost to follow-up) between January 1st, 2004 and December 31st, 2010. Thus, the study included 33 plates (21 3-part and 12 4-part fractures) and 30 nails (21 3-part and nine 4-part fractures). Final functional assessment was based on the Oxford, Constant, Relative Constant and QuickDASH scores and percentage of handicap. Radiological follow-up included immediate postoperative, 6 weeks, 3 months and 1 year AP and Lamy lateral views. All complications were recorded prospectively. Results: Mean Oxford, Constant, Relative Constant and QuickDASH scores and percentage of disability for the plate and nail groups respectively were: 23.8 vs. 23.3, 59.7 vs. 60 6, 73.5 vs 79.3, 20.9 vs 21.0, 22.6 vs 22.6. Multivariate analysis did not show any significant difference in functional scores or quality of reduction: final unsatisfactory reduction on AP view, 30.3 vs. 36.7%; lateral view, 3.2 vs. 10.0%; greater tuberosity, 9.1 vs. 16.7%. Four-part fracture (13< 0.05), frontal reduction defect at follow-up (13< 0.05) or greater tuberosity defect (A > 0.05) had negative impacts on functional scores. The complication rates corresponded to those in the literature and did not differ between the techniques (P=0.1901) except for three infections in the plate group. Discussion- Conclusion: Internal fixation is the treatment of choice for 3- and 4-part fractures in nonosteoporotic patients. Although no difference was found in the present study between locking plate and intramedullary nailing, the former seems to be less well adapted and more aggressive.

Methods: A fracture model was created in femoral synthetic composite bones to simulate a lateral femoral condyle fracture (AO/OTA 33-B1). Fixation was performed using three different types of screw constructs: 1) two 6.5-mm cancellous screws inserted using the lag technique, 2) two 3.5-mm cortical screws inserted using the lag technique, and 3) four 3.5-mm cortical screws, with two inserted using the lag technique and two as position screws. After reduction and fixation, the constructs were axially loaded in a material-testing machine. Main outcome measurements were the mean load required to displace the osteotomy site 1 and 2 mm as well as the mean stiffness of the different fixation methods. Results: The 6.5-mm construct required 56% more load to displace the osteotomy fragment 1 mm than the two 3.5-mm construct required (p < 0.0001), and 40% more load than the four 3.5-mm construct required (p < 0.0001). At loads that caused 2 mm of osteotomy displacement, these differences increased to 62% (p < 0.0001) and 48% (p < 0.0001), respectively. The mean loads needed to displace the osteotomy site were 28% higher for 1 mm of displacement (p = 0.003) and 27% higher for 2 mm of displacement (p = 0.03) for the four 3.5-mm screw construct compared with those needed for the two 3.5-mm group. The mean stiffness for the 6.5-mm group (1312.5 N/mm) was significantly higher than for the four 3.5-mm construct (784.2 N/mm; p < 0.0001) and the two 3.5-mm screw construct (409.4 N/mm; p < 0.0001). The difference in stiffness between the 3.5-mm groups was significant as well (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Stabilization of a unicondylar distal femur fracture with two 6.5-mm cancellous screws provides the most rigid and stable fixation. If small fragment screws are used, a minimum of four 3.5-mm cortical screws should be used to approximate the mechanical stability of two 6.5-mm screws.

There is no consensus in the literature on the conduct to address the fibula fracture. The main objective of this study was to assess its impact on tibial reduction and union. Hypothesis: Fibular fixation plays a positive role in reducing tibial displacement and improving mechanical stability of the entire lesion. Material and methods: This study was based on the multicenter observational group of the 2009 SOFCOT symposium, i.e., 142 metaphyseal fractures of the tibia. The fibula was intact in 10 cases and fractured in 132. In the three main categories of surgical treatment for the tibia (nailing, plating, external fixation) (126 fractures), the fibular lesion was not treated in 79 cases (61%) in this series, nine were treated with intramedullary pinning, and 38 with plate and screw fixation. Results: There was no statistical relation between the anatomic situation of the diaphysis and the anatomic type of the fibular fracture or between the anatomic type of the fibular fracture and its situation compared to the tibial fracture line. The intertubercular and neck fractures were type A1 or B1 (P < 0.001) and were combined to a tibia fracture with a torsional component; the medial-diaphyseal and subtubercular fractures were associated with tibial fracture lines with a simple transversal or comminution or metaphyseal-diaphyseal component (P < 0.032). The rate of pseudarthrosis of the fibular fracture was 4.7% at 1 year; in all these cases, fibular treatment had been conservative. All treatments combined, the tibial axes were statistically better corrected when the fibula was treated with fixation. In four of the 11 cases of axial tibial malunion, the primary fibular fixation caused or worsened them. Discussion: The present clinical series provides results similar to the biomechanical studies. The consequences of fibular fixation perpetuating a tibia reduction abnormality or on the contrary the absence of fibular fixation appeared as probable factors of residual reduction defects, lack of stability of the tibiofibular complex, and tibia non-union. Level of evidence: Level IV (prospective cohort study). (c) 2010 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

There are three reports describing nylon medullary tube failure in the literature. All cases involved the use of nylon medullary tubes during open reduction internal fixation of fractured long bones. We demonstrated increased brittleness and decreased strength with increased exposure of medullary tubes to autoclaving, most dramatically after 100 autoclave cycles. Visual inspection of tubes is a clear indication of material degradation after repeated autoclaving. Furthermore, there is a significant difference in ultimate tensile strength (P < 0.0001) between tubes exposed to less than 100 sterilization cycles compared to tubes exposed to greater than 100 cycles. Likewise, there is a significant decrease in yield stress (P < 0.0004) between the same groups. We recommend disposal and replacement of nylon medullary tubes before they are exposed to 100 autoclaving cycles in order to avoid failure of the device. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Failure to achieve a stable anatomic reduction of ulna head fracture may lead to a distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) dysfunction and nonunion of the distal radius. Due to the lack of the postoperative reporting outcomes and the biomechanical studies, it has not been well established about the optimal management of the comminuted distal ulna head fracture. Hence, the purpose of this study is to use finite element analysis to explain the advantages and disadvantages of ulnar-side locking plate fixation compared with dorsal-side locking plate fixation and its screw arrangement in the treatment of ulnar head fractures. Methods: FE models of the ulnar head fracture and the models of ulnar-side locking plate and dorsal-side plate with two or three distal screws was constructed. In order to simulate forces acting on the ulnar and the osteosynthesis material during daily-life activity in subjects who underwent reconstructive surgery, we applied three loading conditions to each model, viz. 20 N axial compression, 50 N axial compression, 1 N.m torsion moment, 1 N.m lateral bending moments, and 1 N.m extension bending moments. Under these conditions, values of the von Mises stress (VMS) distribution of the implant, peak VMS, the relative displacement of the head and shaft fragments between the fracture ends and the displacement and its direction of the models were investigated. Results: The stress values of ulnar-side plates were lower than those of dorsal-side plates. And the ulnar-plate fixation system also has smaller maximum displacement and relative displacement. When adding a screw in the middle hole of the ulnar head, the values of model displacement and the peak stress in fixation system are lower, but it may evidently concentrate the stress on the middle screw. Conclusions: In conclusion, our study indicated that ulnar-side locking plates resulted in a lower stress distribution in the plate and better stability than dorsal-side locking plates for ulnar head fracture fixation. Adding an additional screw to the ulnar head could increase the stability of the fixation system and provide an anti-torsion function. This study requires clinical confirmation of its practicality in the treatment of ulnar head fractures. This study requires clinical confirmation as to its practicality in the treatment of ulnar head fracture.

Accurate reduction with fixation diminishes pain, permits early patient mobility, and allows the pelvic ring to improve functional outcome. Material and methods This was a retrospective study, whereby 30 polytrauma hospitalized patients were included, with unstable pelvic lesions stabilized with an external fixator as a mean of temporary or definitive fixation. Data collected for these sample were: age, sex, cause of trauma, type of pelvic lesion, associated lesions (ISS score), pelvic stabilization methods, and functional outcome. There were 17 male subjects (57 %) and 13 female subjects (43 %), with a mean age of 42.5 years (range 18-62 years). According to Tile classification, the unstable pelvic ring lesions prevailed; 60 % of patients were type C while three patients with type C instability had associated acetabular fractures, and 40 % had type B rotational instability. Stabilization was achieved using an external fixator in 16 patients; in 14 patients the anterior ring fixation was used with an external fixator combined with posterior stabilization using percutaneous sacroiliac screws. The pelvic stabilization using the external fixator was later replaced with plates and screws (ORIF) in four patients. Follow-up at one, three, six and 12 months postoperatively was based on the Majeed functional score and radiographic assessment. Results Eighteen patients (78 %) had an excellent Majeed functional score, four patients had a good score, and only one patient had a fair functional outcome. Malunions were recorded in four patients with Tile C that were stabilized only by external fixation, and superficial pin track infection occurred in three patients. Within the studied group seven deaths have been recorded (23 %) in patients with extremely severe associated injuries (ISS over 50), this being the decisive factor that determined the unfavourable evolution in six patients. Conclusions The external fixation stabilizes the anterior pelvic ring lesions and it can be combined with the posterior stabilization using percutaneous sacro-iliac screws in case of associated lesions of the posterior ring. The external fixator is very useful especially in the acute phase, acquiring an acceptable reduction and an adequate stability in the partially unstable lesions (Tile B) and also reduces the pelvic volume and bleeding, being considered essential within the resuscitation protocols. The external fixator can be used as a permanent stabilization method when it guarantees a satisfying reduction.

If the surrounding bone quality is poor the screws may migrate, or the bone may fail, resulting in fixation failure. While numerous studies have shown that cement augmentation of the interface between bone and implant can increase screw pull-out force, the physical properties of cement that influence pull-out force have not been investigated. The present study sought to determine how the physical properties of high strength calcium phosphate cements (hsCPCs, specifically dicalcium phosphate) affected the corresponding orthopedic screw pull-out force in urethane foam models of "healthy" and "osteoporotic" synthetic bone (Sawbones). In the simplest model, where only the bond strength between screw thread and cement (without Sawbone) was tested, the correlation between pull-out force and cement compressive strength (R-2 = 0.79) was weaker than correlation with total cement porosity (R-2 = 0.89). In open pore Sawbone that mimics "healthy" cancellous bone density the stronger cements produced higher pull-out force (50-60% increase). High strength, low porosity cements also produced higher pull-out forces (50-190% increase) in "healthy" Sawbones with cortical fixation if the failure strength of the cortical material was similar to, or greater than (a metal shell), actual cortical bone. This result is of particular clinical relevance where fixation with a metal plate implant is indicated, as the nearby metal can simulate a thicker cortical shell, thereby increasing the pull-out force of screws augmented with stronger cements. The improvement in pull-out force was apparent even at low augmentation volumes of 0.5 mL (50% increase), which suggest that in clinical situations where augmentation volume is limited the stronger, lower porosity calcium phosphate cement (CPC) may still produce a significant improvement in screw pull-out force. When the correlation strength of all the tested models were compared both cement porosity and compressive strength accurately predicted pull-out force (R-2=1.00, R-2= 0.808), though prediction accuracy depended upon the strength of the material surrounding the Sawbone. The correlations strength was low for bone with no, or weak, cortical fixation (R-2= 0.56, 0.36). Higher strength and lower porosity CPCs also produced greater pull-out force (1-1.5 kN) than commercial CPC (0.2-0.5 kN), but lower pull-out force than PMMA (2-3 kN). The results of this study suggest that the likelihood of screw fixation failure may be reduced by selecting calcium phosphate cements with lower porosity and higher compressive strength, in patients with healthy bone mineral density and/or sufficient cortical thickness. This is of particular clinical relevance when fixation with metal plates is indicated, or where the augmentation volume is limited.

First-line management of distal humerus fracture by total elbow arthroplasty in geriatric traumatology: Results in a 21-patient series at a minimum 2 years' follow-up	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Distal humerusfracture; Total elbow arthroplasty; Osteoporotic fracture; Elderly	COMMINUTED INTRAARTICULAR FRACTURES; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; COMPLEX FRACTURES; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; REPLACEMENT; EXPERIENCE	Introduction: Total elbow arthroplasty (TEA) is one option in distal humerus fracture in elderly osteoporotic patients. Hypothesis: The study hypothesis was that, in patients aged 70 years or more, TEA provides functional results and ranges of motion compatible with everyday activity, with a complications rate equal to or lower than with internal fixation, and no loss of autonomy or cognitive impairment. Material and methods: In this retrospective study, 21 patients receiving TEA for distal humerus fracture were included. Mean follow-up was 3.2 years, with functional (Quick DASH and MEPS), cognitive (MMSE), autonomy-related (ADL) and radiological assessment (Morrey). Results: Mean MEPS was 84 and QuickDASH 32.4. Mean extension deficit was 22 degrees, and mean flexion 125 degrees. There was no loss of autonomy or cognitive impairment. The complications rate was 9.5%. There were no revision surgeries. Discussion: TEA proved reliable in comminuted distal humerus fracture in elderly patients. Functional results were comparable to those in the literature, and the complications rate was lower. Long-term implant survival needs confirmation to validate this option as a treatment of choice in these indications in geriatric traumatology. Type of study: Retrospective non-comparative, single-center. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.	[Lami, D.; Chivot, M.; Caubere, A.; Argenson, J.

Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus Treated With Fresh Talar Allografts	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Osteochondral Lesions; Talus; Osteochondral Allograft	CLINICAL RATING SYSTEMS; FOOT FUNCTION INDEX; ARTICULAR-CARTILAGE; TRANSPLANTATION; DEFECTS; ARTHRITIS	Background: Osteochondral lesions of the talar dome (OLT) can be devastating injuries. Many of these problems occur in younger adult patients and can cause permanent joint pain and stiffness. Several treatment methods have been used to treat the symptomatic lesion, including arthroscopic debridement and microfracture, transfer of autologous osteoarticular tissue from the knee or talus (OATS), autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), frozen and fresh allograft transplantation. Materials and Methods: Eighteen patients underwent fresh talar allograft transplantation with internal fixation for an OLT. Fresh talar allograft transplantation involved arthrotomy of the ankle, often with malleolar osteotomy, and replacement of the talar dome defect with fresh talar allograft tissue and internal fixation. Thirteen of the 18 patients returned for clinical and radiographic examination in addition to completing two validated questionnaires. The other five patients did not return for followup evaluation. The 13 patients who were seen in followup had an average age of 30 (range, 15 to 44) years with a mean followup of 48 months. Results: There was a significant difference (p < 0.01) between the patients' preoperative and postoperative pain and activity abilities as measured with the Foot Function Index and AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot questionnaires. Clinical examination and X-rays confirmed healing of the graft. Conclusion: Based on these results, we conclude that this is a reasonable procedure for younger adult patients with focal osteochondral talar defects that cannot he corrected with curretage and microfracture.

These open tibial fractures are often associated with wound infection, soft tissue necrosis, bone nonunion, osteomyelitis or amputation. Staged treatment for this severe trauma is very necessary. Materials and Methods: 25 cases of Gustilo Anderson IIIB/C open tibial fractures with serious soft-tissue defects treated between January 2010 and January 2015 were included in this study. The treatment was administered in three stages. The first stage included emergency debridement, external fixation, repair of damaged main blood vessels and nerves, covering of the wound, and infection control. The second stage involved skin flap or skin graft placement to repair wounds. The third stage involved replacement of the external fixator with an internal fixator and the placement of bone grafts. Results: All the skin flaps or skin grafts survived, and a small necrotic area in the distal flap was observed in only two cases (which resolved spontaneously after the dressing was changed). Bone union occurred at the predicted time in 23 cases, while it was delayed in 2 cases. The rate of excellent and good was 88%. Conclusion: Staged treatment was safe and effective for Gustilo Anderson IIIB/C tibial fractures. The timing for the placement of internal and external fixators and choosing the appropriate skin flap repair technique are important.

J	Cillo, JE; Ellis, E				Cillo, Joseph E., Jr.; Ellis, Edward, III			Treatment of patients with double unilateral fractures of the mandible	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article								Purpose: To analyze the outcomes of treatment for double unilateral mandibular fracture. Materials and Methods: Retrospective chart review of patients who were treated between 1994 and 2004 for 2 mandibular fractures on the same side of the mandible. Data collected involved age, gender, race, cause of fracture, treatment modality, length of follow-up, occlusal relationship at last visit, preoperative and postoperative clinical photographs and radiographs, and incidence and management of complications. Standard descriptive statistics were used. Results: From a total of 1,287 mandibular fractures for which charts were available, 31 double unilateral mandibular fractures were treated during a 10-year period, for an occurrence rate of 2.4%. Demographic characteristics of these patients were similar to those of patients in other published studies on mandibular fracture. Fractures involved angle + body (18/31, 58%), condyle + body (11/31, 35%), and condyle + angle (2/31, 6%). Various treatments were provided for these fractures, but open reduction and internal fixation were applied to at least I of the fractures. Follow-up ranged from 6 weeks to 5 months (average, 9.6 weeks). Eight patients (8/31, 25.8%) developed complications involving visible gonial flaring; 3 of these also had cross-bite. Conclusion: Double unilateral mandibular fracture is a rare event. The difficulty inherent in treating these fractures can be alleviated with the use of proper techniques of open reduction and internal fixation; however, treatment continues to be associated with a high complication rate.

SURGICAL AND RADIOLOGIC ANATOMY			English	Article						Distal humerus; Bone mineral density; Osteoporosis; Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry; Quantitative CT	CORTICAL THICKNESS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; FRACTURES; OSTEOPOROSIS	Introduction The aim of this study was to investigate three methods of prediction of the bone quality of the distal humerus: dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), Ct-Scan and plain radiographs. Materials and methods The bone mineral density (BMD) of 21 cadaveric distal humerus was determined using DEXA at two levels. Then a CT-scan and anteroposterior radiographs were taken. The cancellous density was estimated with the CT-scan. The cortico-medullar index (CMI) was calculated as cortical thickness divided by total bone thickness on AP views. Results A significant positive correlation was found between the BMD of the epiphysis and the CMI of r = 0.61. The mean BMD of the distal humerus was 0.559 g/cm(2). Male specimens showed a significantly higher BMD than females. The mean CMI of diaphysis was 1.431 and the mean BMD of the metaphysis region was 0.444 g/cm(2). Discussion More than a direct evaluation of the bone density with a CT-scan, the CMI of the distal humerus diaphysis is a predictor of the bone quality of the distal humerus. This should be of great help for the surgeon's decision making in case of fracture of the distal humerus, as open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF) of fractures of the distal humerus can lead to failure due to poor bone quality.

Real-time dosimetry reduces radiation exposure of orthopaedic surgeons	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Occupational exposure; Radiation; Orthopaedic surgery; Dosimetry	INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY; IONIZING-RADIATION; BREAST-CANCER; RISK; FLUOROSCOPY; PREVALENCE; FRACTURES	Background: Cancer prevalence of orthopaedic surgeons is elevated and chronic exposure to occupational ionizing radiation is seen as one reason. Hypothesis: Use of a new dosimeter enabling radiation dose monitoring in real-time may reduce radiation exposure of orthopaedic surgeons. Materials and methods: Over a period of four months, the surgeon and the C-arm operator were equipped with a novel dosimeter called DoseAware (R) (DA) while using the C-arm fluoroscope intraoperatively. Data of 68 patients DA were retrospectively compared using matched-pair analysis with 68 controls without DA. Both groups were assessed regarding fluoroscopic time (FT) and radiation dose (RD). Seven types of operative procedures were performed: internal fixation of subcapital humerus fractures, midshaft clavicular fractures, distal radius fractures, pertrochanteric femoral fractures, ankle fractures, traumatic vertebral fractures and osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Results: Concerning the FT, use of DoseAware (R) led to a significant reduction for all evaluated operation types except for internal fixation of distal radius fractures (P=0.0511). Regarding the RD, use of DoseAware (R) led to a significant reduction for all evaluated operation types except trochanteric femoral fractures with a PFNA (R) (P= 0.0841). Conclusion: DoseAware (R) allowing real-time radiation dose monitoring reduces radiation exposure of the orthopaedic surgeon and instantly demonstrates the effects of dose-reduction techniques. Level of evidence: Level III retrospective case control study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.	[Mueller, M. C.; Welle, K.; Strauss, A.; Pennekamp, P.

J	Xie, H; Liu, BL; Chen, HL; Xu, Q				Xie, Hao; Liu, Bailing; Chen, Hualin; Xu, Qian			Inner relationship between the damping property and the sand-fixing durability of polymer materials	JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE			English	Article						anti-wind erosion property; damping property; dangling chain; PVAc; sand-fixing durability	DANGLING CHAINS; DESERTIFICATION; DESERT; STABILIZATION; SOIL; RESTORATION; MONGOLIA; REGION; DUNES; MULCH	This article for the first time reveals the impact of the damping property of materials on its sand-fixing durability. Based on the turbulence of wind, it could be regarded as a kind of periodic mechanical force. So, when polymers are used to fix sand, they would constantly perceive a periodic force of wind. And, this force would give rise to yielding fracture and fatigue of polymer, so that the sand-fixing durability of material could be weakened significantly. To impair the periodic force of wind and extend the durability of sand-fixation polymer materials, we, for the first time, introduce the designing principle of macromolecular damping material, that can transform external mechanical force into own thermal energy, into the preparation of sand-fixing materials. In this work, poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) emulsions with different dangling chain have been synthesized successfully in order to improve their damping properties. The effects of the prepared PVAc with gradually growing dangling chain length have been investigated on their damping properties, on the sand stabilization strengths and sand-fixing durability. And the relationship between the damping property and the sand-fixing property of PVAc was built by simulating wind tunnel test. The experimental results show that, introducing the dangling chain could significantly improve the damping temperature range and extend the anti-wind erosion time of PVAc. It has to be noticed that, introducing the dangling chain, will provide a double effects for the sand stabilization strength of materials, i.e., it can improve both the flexibility of the side-chain and the internal friction of the molecular chains. Wind tunnel test verified that introducing the dangling chain can raise the damping performance of material and convert more periodic force of wind into the friction heat of molecular chain, and thus impair the damage of wind on the materials and improve their anti-wind erosion properties. These findings suggest that the damping material applied in sand fixation is a bright idea and successful method for improving the sand-fixing durability. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl.

Hypothesis: Carbon-fiber reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFR-PEEK) plate features similar biomechanical properties to metallic plates, representing, therefore, an optimal alternative for the treatment of distal radius fractures. Materials and Methods: Three different materials-composed plates were evaluated: stainless steel volar lateral column (Zimmer); titanium DVR (Hand Innovations); CFR-PEEK DiPHOS-RM (Lima Corporate). Six plates for each type were implanted in sawbones and an extra-articular rectangular osteotomy was created. Three plates for each material were tested for load to failure and bending stiffness in axial compression. Moreover, 3 constructs for each plate were evaluated after dynamically loading for 6000 cycles of fatigue. Results: The mean bending stiffness pre-fatigue was significantly higher for the stainless steel plate. The titanium plate yielded the higher load to failure both pre and post fatigue. After cyclic loading, the bending stiffness increased by a mean of 24% for the stainless steel plate; 33% for the titanium; and 17% for the CFR-PEEK plate. The mean load to failure post-fatigue increased by a mean of 10% for the stainless steel and 14% for CFR-PEEK plates, whereas it decreased ( -16%) for the titanium plate. Statistical analysis between groups reported significant values (p < 001) for all comparisons except for Hand Innovations vs. Zimmer bending stiffness post fatigue (p = .197). Discussion: The significant higher load to failure of the titanium plate, makes it indicated for patients with higher functional requirements or at higher risk of trauma in the post-operative period. The CFR-PEEK plate showed material-specific disadvantages, represented by little tolerance to plastic deformation, and lower load to failure. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

All patients with a single type A thoracic or lumbar fracture, treated by the studied technique between 2017 and 2020, have been included. Demographic data, fracture type, removal procedure achievement and term were collected. Radiological parameters were measured at five timepoints: pre-operative, intra-operative, immediate post-operative, early post-operative (< 3 months) and at follow-up (1 year). Vertebral wedge angle (angle between the two endplates of the fractured vertebra) and traumatic regional angulation (TRA-calculated by subtracting regional kyphosis physiological values).Results 150 patients were included. Mean age was 48.6 +/- 17.8 years. Average follow-up was 14.4 +/- 3 months. 82 patients had secondary instrumentation removal. Mean time to removal was 6.4 +/- 2.4 months. TRA correction loss between immediate post-operative and last follow-up was greater in removal group: 5.1 +/- 5.6 degrees versus 2.7 +/- 4.7 degrees (p = 0.01). Material was removed earlier in younger patients (p = 0.002). TRA correction loss was similar in the early and late removal groups (p = 0.83). Multivariate analysis identified only Magerl/AO A3 fractures as risk factor for loss of TRA correction (p = 0.007).Conclusion Instrumentation removal was associated with good radiological outcomes with a non-significant loss of vertebral wedge angle and tolerable loss of traumatic regional angulation (+ 2.4 degrees compared to the no-removal group), even if performed early.

Linking the distal humerus columns in articular fracture fixation	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Distal humerus columns; Distal humerus fracture; Intra-articular fracture; Locked plating; Parallel plating; Screw interdigitation	OPEN REDUCTION; INTERNAL-FIXATION; PLATE; COMPLICATIONS; STABILITY; PARALLEL; SCREWS; ELBOW; ANGLE; BONE	Introduction: Concerning rates of nonunion in articular distal humerus fractures indicate an unsolved problem. The fixation principles of O'Driscoll describe linking the fractured articular segment to the distal humerus columns with compression screws which creates a stable fixed angle construct. A novel device has been introduced which utilizes an interlocking beam through the articular segment to connect the distal aspect of the medial and lateral plates, creating a linked construct. We sought to evaluate the stability of this linked construct using an articular model of distal humerus fracture. Materials and methods: Ten matched pair specimens of 65 years of age or older were randomized to the use (LB group) or non-use (NLB group) of an interlocking beam to link the medial and lateral locking plates in fixation of an AO Type C3 fracture model. Outside of the linking beam, fixation between the matched pairs was consistent using 2.7 mm locking screws distally with fixed trajectories and +/- 2 mm lengths. Results: Mean stiffness was 273 Newtons/mm in the LB group and 225 Newtons/mm in the NLB group (p = 0.001). Mean maximum displacement was 0.28 in the LB group and 0.93 mm in the NLB group (p = 0.006). Mean load to failure was 277 pounds in the LB group and 280 pounds in the NLB group (p = 0.94). Discussion: Our results indicate that an interlocking beam which links the medial and lateral plates provides greater stability compared to a similar construct without an interlocking beam. We attribute this finding to the beam's double supported design which resists cantilever bending and provides robust compression of the fractured fragments.

CT based evaluation of odontoid morphology in the Indian population	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Indian population; internal fixation; odontoid morphology; odontoid process; type II odontoid fracture	ANTERIOR SCREW FIXATION; COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHIC EVALUATION; ACUTE FRACTURES; AXIS; DENS	Background: Anterior fixation using two 3.5 mm screws is typically recommended for type II odontoid fractures. However, it is unsuitable in patients with an odontoid diameter of <9.0 mm. There is no data regarding the morphology of odontoid process in the Indian population. The aim of our study was to: a) Measure the external diameters of odontoid process in the Indian population using CT scan and thus determine the feasibility of two 3.5 mm screw fixation in them. b) Determine if any correlation exists between body height (Ht) and weight (Wt) and external odontoid diameters. Materials and Methods: CT images of odontoid process of 100 consecutive patients were analyzed. Antero-posterior (AP) and transverse (TD), outer diameters of the odontoid process were measured from the base and at 1 mm interval upwards on axial CT images. Results: The mean AP and mean TD were 11.52 mm and 9.85 mm, respectively. Fifty-five (55%) of the patients had at least one TD <9.0 mm. Five (5%) patients had at least one TD <7.4 mm. None of the patients had any diameter <5.5 mm. Body Ht correlated significantly with mean AP and mean TD of the odontoid process (AP: r = 0.276, P = 0.013; TD: r = 0.359, P = 0.001), whereas body Wt correlated significantly only with mean TD (AP: r = 0.162, P = 0.15; TD: r = 0.297, P = 0.007). Conclusion: More than half of the study population (55%) was unsuitable for two 3.5 mm screw fixation for type II odontoid fracture. Two 2.7 mm screws can be safely used in 95% of the population. A 4.5 mm Herbert screw can be safely used in the entire population. We recommend two 2.7 mm screws or a 4.5 mm Herbert screw for fixation of these fractures in the Indian population. Body height showed a significant correlation with external odontoid diameters, whereas weight showed significant correlation only with TD of the odontoid process.

Material/Methods: The data of 62 patients with Ruedi-Allgower type II/III tibial pilon fractures who were treated in Liuzhou People's hospital from January 2017 to December 2018 were extracted in this retrospective analysis. There were 32 patients in the temporary external fixation (TEF) group and 30 patients in calcaneal traction (CT) group. Outcomes, including the duration of the surgical procedure, pin track infection, degree of limb swelling, time to second-stage operation, postoperative comfort score, and visual analog scale (VAS) score, were compared. Results: The effective rate of swelling reduction after treatment was 85% in the TEF group and 60% in the CT group; the average time to the second-stage operation was 8.34 +/- 1.29 days in the TEF group and 10.60 +/- 2.27 days in the CT group; the postoperative comfort scores were 70.1 +/- 3.2 and 61.3 +/- 3.5 in the TEF group and CT group, respectively; the postoperative VAS scores at 24 h, 48 h, and 7 days were 7.90 +/- 1.06, 4.88 +/- 0.83, 2.72 +/- 1.14 in TEF group, and 8.50 +/- 0.86, 6.27 +/- 1.36, 3.57 +/- 1.19 in CT group, respectively. There were 1 case of pin tract infection identified in the TEF group and 4 in the CT group. All differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). Conclusions: The modified external fixation is more effective than calcaneal traction in treatment of Ruedi-Allgower type II/III tibial pilon fractures in the first-stage of combined management.

Therefore, a 2.7 mm fixed-angle plate designed for the treatment of patella fractures was tested biomechanically against the currently preferred methods of fixation. It was hypothesized that under simulated cyclic loading fixed-angle plating would be superior to modified anterior tension wiring or cannulated lag screws with anterior tension wiring. Materials and methods: Eighteen human cadaver knees, matched by bone mineral density and age, were divided into three groups of six. After setting a transverse patella fracture each group received one of the osteosyntheses mentioned above. Repetitive testing over 100 cycles was performed at non-destructive loads by simulating knee motion from 908 flexion to full extension. Results: Anterior tension wiring as well as lag screws with tension wiring showed significant fracture displacement after the initial cycle already. Both constructs, lag screws plus wiring (3.7 +/- 2.7 mm) as well as tension wiring alone (7.1 +/- 2.2 mm) displayed fracture displacement of >2 mm which is clinically regarded as failure. Those patellae stabilized with fixed-angle plates showed no significant fracture gap widening after completion of 100 cycles (0.7 +/- 0.5 mm). The differences between the fixed-angle plate group and the other two groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05).

Currently, the most frequently used osteosynthesis materials are metal-based; however, in certain cases, such as complex comminuted osteoporotic fractures, they may not provide the best solution due to their rigid and non-customizable nature. In phalanx fractures in particular, metal plates have been shown to induce joint stiffness and soft tissue adhesions. A new osteosynthesis method using a light curable polymer composite has been developed. This method has demonstrated itself to be a versatile solution that can be shaped by surgeons in situ and has been shown to induce no soft tissue adhesions. In this study, the biomechanical performance of AdhFix was compared to conventional metal plates. The osteosyntheses were tested in seven different groups with varying loading modality (bending and torsion), osteotomy gap size, and fixation type and size in a sheep phalanx model. AdhFix demonstrated statistically higher stiffnesses in torsion (64.64 +/- 9.27 and 114.08 +/- 20.98 Nmm/degrees vs. 33.88 +/- 3.10 Nmm/degrees) and in reduced fractures in bending (13.70 +/- 2.75 Nm/mm vs. 8.69 +/- 1.16 Nmm/degrees), while the metal plates were stiffer in unreduced fractures (7.44 +/- 1.75 Nm/mm vs. 2.70 +/- 0.72 Nmm/degrees). The metal plates withstood equivalent or significantly higher torques in torsion (534.28 +/- 25.74 Nmm vs. 614.10 +/- 118.44 and 414.82 +/- 70.98 Nmm) and significantly higher bending moments (19.51 +/- 2.24 and 22.72 +/- 2.68 Nm vs. 5.38 +/- 0.73 and 1.22 +/- 0.30 Nm). This study illustrated that the AdhFix platform is a viable, customizable solution that is comparable to the mechanical properties of traditional metal plates within the range of physiological loading values reported in literature.

Materials and methods A retrospective matched cohort study was conducted involving patients admitted to a single tertiary trauma centre having sustained a clavicle fracture with ipsilateral rib fracture/s between January 2014 and June 2020. Patients were excluded if brain, abdominal, pelvic, or lower limb trauma was identified. 31 patients with operative clavicle fixation (study group) were matched 1:1 to 31 patients with non-operative management of the clavicle fracture (control group) based on age, sex, number of rib fractures and injury severity score. The primary outcome was the number of analgesic types used, and the secondary outcome was respiratory function. Results The study group required a mean of 3.50 types of analgesia prior to surgery which decreased to 1.57 post-surgery. The control group required 2.92 types of analgesia, reducing to 1.65 after the date of surgery in the study group. A General Linear Mixed Model indicated that the intervention (operative vs. non-operative management) had statistically significant effects on the number of required analgesic types (p < 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.365), oxygen saturation (p = 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.341, 95% CI 0.153-0.529) and temporal decline in daily supplemental oxygen requirement (p < 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.626, 95% CI 0.455-0.756). Conclusion This study supported the hypothesis that operative clavicle fixation reduces short-term in-patient analgesia use and improves respiratory parameters in patients with ipsilateral rib fractures.

Materials and methods: The study retrospectively analyzed 167 patients who had undergone internal fixation using volar locking plate for DRF between 2010 and 2013. Group 1 was denoted as the "normal group," and group 2 was denoted as the "stiff shoulder group." Basic demographic factors evaluated included age, sex, bone mineral density (BMD), and the dominancy. Also investigated were radiologic variables, including concurrent fractures of the styloid process, positive ulnar variances, classification of DRF, and morphologic type of the distal radioulnar joint. Finally, the type of plate, methods used for postoperative protection, and time of union were analyzed. Results: Group 1 consisted of 114 patients, and group 2 consisted of 53 patients. On overall univariate analysis, BMD, hand dominancy, and the protective methods after plating were significantly different between the 2 groups. On multivariate analysis, a lower BMD and injury on the nondominant side were significant factors for shoulder stiffness. Stiffness was significantly higher in patients with a mean BMD < -2.6 than in patients with a mean BMD = -2.6. At the final follow-up, all of the 53 patients in group 2 were relieved of the symptoms of a stiff shoulder. Conclusions: A lower BMD and injury on the nondominant distal radius were distinct factors for the development of a stiff shoulder after operative fixation in DRF. Fortunately, nonoperative treatments, such as stretching exercises/injections, were useful for the relief of these symptoms in the short-term follow-up.

However, there is still much argument about whether volar plating is equivalent to dorsal (buttressing) plating, especially in the management of intra-articular extension fractures. This biomechanical study was performed to determine, in a simple intra-articular fracture model, whether dorsal or volar plate constructs would be more stable. Materials and methods: Six pairs of fresh frozen radii were examined with dual-energy absorptiometry (DXA) to determine their bone mineral density (BMD). An AO type 23 C2.1 fracture was created. Volar fixation was with a 2.4 mm Variable-Angle LCP Two-Column Volar Distal Radius Plate; dorsal fixation was with two orthogonal 2.4 mm Variable-Angle LCP Dorsal Distal Radius Plates (both devices: Synthes, Oberdorf, Switzerland). Biomechanical testing used a proven protocol involving static tests of stiffness, and a cyclic test to obtain range of motion (ROM), maximum deformation, and subsidence data. Results: None of the constructs failed during biomechanical testing. The two groups (volar and dorsal plating, respectively) did not differ significantly in terms of initial (pre-cyclic-testing) and final (post-cyclic-testing) stiffness. Equally, there was no significant difference between the subsidence values in the two groups. The post-cyclic-testing ROM was significantly greater in the dorsal-plate group as compared with the volar-plate group. The volar constructs showed a significant decrease in the ROM between pre- and post-cyclic testing. Conclusion: Biomechanically, volar plating with a modern variable-angle locking plate is equivalent to dorsal plating with two modern variable-angle locking plates. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The bio-absorbable suture anchor is a novel internal fixation for PCLAF. This study aims to estimate and compare the safety, efficacy, and functional outcomes between the bio-absorbable anchor and the traditional suture pull-out technique for arthroscopic fixation of PCLAF. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study. PCLAF patients were included from 1 January 2020, to 31 August 2021, in our department, and randomly divided into the absorbable anchor group and control group (pull-out suture fixation). Clinical assessments included: post drawer test, gravity test, anterior-posterior laxity (KT-2000), range of motion, Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, total failure rate, and returning to sports rate. The minimum follow-up was 1 year (y). Results: 31 patients had accomplished the 1 year follow-up (missing rate: 13.9%). We did not face any complications such as neurovascular injury, fever, infection, un-union, or re-rupture during the follow-up. CT scan showed that all of the patients in the two groups had a well bone union at 3 months in post-operation. At 1 year follow-up, the total failure rate of the bio-absorbable anchor group (1/17, p = 0.036) was lower than the control group (5/14), and the IKDC (86.24 +/- 4.35, p = 0.008) and return to sports rate (11/17, p = 0.045) of the bio-absorbable anchor group were higher than that of the control group (81.43 +/- 5.06) (4/14). Conclusion: Both the bio-absorbable anchor and suture pull-out technique for arthroscopic fixation of PCLAF have acquired a well bone union and superior safety, but the bio-absorbable anchor group had better efficacy and functional outcomes than the traditional pull-out technique.

Andrew			The Effect of Distal Radius Locking Plates on Articular Contact Pressures	JOURNAL OF HAND SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME			English	Article						Distal radius locking plates; subchondral hardware placement; articular contact pressure	COLLES FRACTURE; FIXATION; STRESS; JOINT; WRIST; VOLAR; MODEL; POSITION; LOADS	Purpose Fractures of the distal radius are among the most common injuries treated in hand surgery practice, and distal radius locking plates have become an increasingly popular method of fixation. Despite widespread use of this technology, it is unknown whether the subchondral placement of locking screws affects the loading profile of the distal radius. Our study was designed to determine whether subchondral locking screws change the articular contact pressures in the distal radius. Methods Twelve cadaveric forearms underwent a previously described axial loading protocol in a materials testing machine. We used an intra-articular, real-time computerized force sensor to measure peak contact pressure, total pressure, and contact area in the distal radius. Internal validation of sensor placement and reproducibility was conducted. Each specimen was tested before fixation (control), after application of a palmar distal radius locking plate, and after simulation of a metaphyseal fracture. Results We identified no statistically significant differences in maximum pressure, total pressure, and contact area among control, plated, and plated and fractured specimens. However, the contact footprint-represented by squared differences in force across the sensor-were significantly different between the control group and both plated groups. Conclusions The technique for measuring contact pressures produces highly repeatable values. Distal radius locking plates with subchondral hardware placement do not seem to significantly change articular contact pressures. Clinical relevance Although locking screws placed in subchondral bone of the distal radius for fracture fixation may alter the stress distribution across the radiocarpal joint, we found no evidence that peak stresses across the joint were changed. Therefore, it seems unlikely that periarticular locking screws contribute to long-term arthrosis after fixation of extra-articular distal radius fractures. (J Hand Surg 2011;36A:1303-1309.

This study compares the mechanical stability of "correctly" affixed LISS plates matching the slope of the lateral femoral condyle to "incorrectly" placed LISS plates fixed in external rotation relative to the distal femur. Methods: A fracture gap model was created to simulate a comminuted supracondylar femur fracture (AO/OTA33-A3). Fixation was achieved using two different plate positions: the LISS plate was either placed "correctly" by internally rotating the plate to match the slope of the lateral femoral condyle, or "incorrectly" by externally rotating the plate relative to the distal femur. Following fixation, the constructs were loaded in axial, torsional, and cyclical axial modes in a material testing machine. Main Outcome Measurement: Stiffness in axial and torsional loading; total deformation and irreversible (plastic) deformation in cyclical axial loading. Results: The mean axial stiffness for the correctly placed LISS constructs was 21.5% greater than the externally rotated LISS constructs (62.7 N/mm vs. 49.3 N/mm; P = 0.0007). No significant difference was found in torsional stiffness between the two groups. Cyclical axial loading caused significantly less (P < 0.0001) plastic deformation in the correct group (0.6 mm) compared with externally rotated group (1.3 mm). All the constructs in the incorrect group failed, where failure was defined as a complete closure of the medial fracture gap, prior to completion of the test cycles. Conclusion: Correct positioning of the LISS plate for fixation of distal femur fractures results in improved mechanical stability as reflected by an increased stiffness in axial loading and decreased plastic deformation at the bone-screw interface.

Materials and methods: 579 (520 male, 59 female) Syrian civilian war victims who were treated in our clinic from December 16,2011 till August 17,2013. The mean age was 30 years (range: 1-90 years). Anatomic distribution and mechanism of injuries, and applied treatments were the main outcomes. Results: 449 subjects were wounded by gunshot, 44 by blast injuries and 86 by other causes. 668 open fractures and 98 closed fractures were treated. 514 grade 3a open fractures which were relatively clean and early-admitted were treated as immediate aggressive debridement and internal fixation. Early infection rate was 2.7% (n=14). Eight subjects had 10 grade 3b open fractures. Seventy patients presented with 99 grade 3c open fractures. Totally 84 external fixations were applied. 138 major amputations were done in 69 subjects. Wound infections were seen in 77 patients (13.2%). 29 of them were previously operated under non-sterile conditions in Syria. Debridenzent & irrigation (D&I) was the most commonly applied treatment. Conclusion: In conclusion gunshot was the main wounding agent in the recent Syrian conflicts, D&I was the most commonly applied treatment. In the treatment of relatively clear and early arrived grade 3a open fractures, internal fixation, after aggressive debridement and irrigation, resulted with low infection rates and it can be considered as a good choice of treatment. Prior interventions under non-sterile conditions were associated with 63% of resistant infections and extend the duration of hospital stay. Early evacuation and thorough debridement will result in lower infection rates.

Two Fractures with minimal displacement, regardless of the number of fracture lines, can be treated with closed reduction and early mobilization, but anatomical reduction in displaced fractures is difficult to obtain and the incidence of pseudarthrosis is high 3-5. We evaluated the functional results of closed Neers 2- and 3-part proximal humerus fractures treated by Joshis external stabilizing system. Materials and Methods: Sixteen patients with proximal humeral fractures were managed from 2008 to 2010 by Joshis stabilizing external fixation. They were 10 males and 6 females, with a mean age of 57.5 years. Based on Neers classification, there were eleven 3-part fractures and five 2-part fractures. The mechanism of injuries included seven road traffic accidents and nine fall. Shoulder mobilization exercises were started within 1 week after stabilization with JESS. External fixation was removed after the evidence of union (6-8 weeks). Pain was evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS) and shoulder range of motion was evaluated by Constant Scoring System. Followup was done at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and then at every 4 weeks. Results: Mean followup was of 20.5 months (range 9-30 months). Postoperative mean VAS score and Constant Score of patients was 2.1 (0.73) and 78.1 (9.61) at an average followup of 6 months. Mean duration for union was 6.5 (1.18) weeks. One case of K-wire loosening and one case of pin tract infection were the complications noted. Conclusion: External fixation by JESS is an alternative option to treat Neers 2 and 3 part proximal humerus fractures with good results.

To solve these problems, this study develops a CO2 foam concrete (CFC) material with both heat insulation and carbon fixation characteristics to realize CO2 in situ storage and utilization. In this study, a Portland-cement-based CO2 foam concrete (PC-CFC) with good thermal insulation performance and carbon fixation ability is prepared using carbonation pretreatment cement and a physical foaming method. The effects of CO2 on the compressive strength, thermal insulation, and carbon fixation properties of PC-CFC are studied. The internal relationship between the compressive strength, thermal insulation, and carbon fixation performance of PC-CFC is analyzed, and the feasibility of PC-CFC as a filling material to realize the in situ mineralization and storage of CO2 in the coal-electricity integration base is discussed. The experimental results show that the compressive strength of PC-CFC is significantly improved by CO2 curing. However, CO2 in the PC-CFC pores may weaken the strength of the pore structure, and the compressive strength decreases by 3.62% for each 1% increase in PC-CFC porosity. Using CO2 as a foaming gas and the physical foaming method to prepare CFC can achieve improved thermal insulation performance. The thermal conductivity of PC-CFC is 0.0512-0.0905 W/(m.K). In addition, the compressive strength of PC-CFC increases by 19.08% when the thermal conductivity of PC-CFC increases by 1%. On the premise of meeting the thermal insulation requirements, PC-CFC can achieve improved compressive strength. The carbon sequestration rate of the PC-CFC skeleton is 6.1-8.57%, and the carbon storage capacity of PC-CFC pores is 1.36-2.60 kg/ton, which has obvious carbon sequestration potential; however, the preparation process and parameters of PC-CFC still require further improvement. The research results show that PC-CFC has great potential for engineering applications and is of great significance for realizing carbon reduction at the coal-electricity integration base.

The literature is rather poor on preserving talar vascularization in single or dual approaches. A dual approach allows better exposure and should limit devascularization. Locking plates are one of the modern solutions for challeng-ing comminuted fractures. The aim of this study was to determine clinical and radiological outcomes in complex talar fracture (CTF) of the neck and body, fixed by locking plates through a dual approach with at least one locking plate.Hypothesis: Locking-plate fixation of CTF through a dual approach leads to good clinical outcome.Material and methods: A single-center retrospective study included 12 cases of CTF treated between January 2007 and May 2019. 3D CT was systematically performed to plan surgery. A dual approach and at least one locking plate were used for fixation. Clinical outcome was evaluated on AOFAS score. Reduction quality and correlation to clinical results were evaluated, reduction with < 2 mm joint step being considered satisfactory. Consolidation rate and occurrence of avascular necrosis of the talus (ANT), post-traumatic arthritis (PTA) and postoperative complications were analyzed.Results: Mean follow-up was 27 months (range, 15-47). Mean AOFAS score was 70 +/- 18 (range, 30-97). Inframillimetric reduction was achieved in 67% of cases, without significant correlation with clinical results. The consolidation rate was 91.6%, ANT rate 18.2% and PTA rate 45.5%. One patient presented septic osteoarthritis secondary to scar necrosis.Conclusion: Locking plate fixation of CTF through a dual approach provided acceptable clinical outcomes.

This study compares the clinical and radiological outcome of fixation with Kirschner wire (K-wire) and with cancellous screw (CS) in neglected fracture lateral condyle humerus. Materials and Methods: 42 patients of neglected lateral condyle humerus fracture, treated either by open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with K-wire or ORIF with CS were included in study. The comparisons were made in term of slab immobilization time, union time, improved range of motion (ROM), final achieved carrying angle, and functional outcome measured by Liverpool Elbow Score (LES). Results: There were 22 patients in Group I with mean age 7.8 years and 20 patients in Group II with mean age 7.3 years. Mean delay in presentation was 12.9 versus 15.6 weeks (P > 0.05). Mean followup was 26.9 versus 26.7 months. Mean duration of immobilization was 11.6 versus 9.4 weeks (P < 0.001). Improved carrying angle was 6.8 degrees versus 9.7 degrees (P < 0.05). Mean gain in ROM was 17.7 degrees versus 27.5 degrees (P < 0.05). Mean LES was 8.15 versus 8.18 (P > 0.05). Premature closure of physis was observed in two patients. Pin tract infection was seen in three of Group I (P > 0.05). Conclusion: There was no difference in LES, irrespective of implant used. Screw was better in terms of duration of slab, improvement in carrying angle and ROM.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiographic performances of the HBS in the treatment of anterior mandibular fractures and compare it with the common and established treatment modalities, the lag screw (LS) and the 2.0-mm miniplate (MP). Materials and Methods: This study implemented a randomized clinical trial and enrolled a sample of patients with anterior mandibular fractures. The primary predictor variable was treatment group categorized as HBS, LS, or MP fixation of the fracture. Primary outcome variables were the presence of interfragmentary mobility and radiodensitometric appraisal of fracture healing progression. The secondary outcome was the postoperative clinical evaluation. Other variables collected were grouped into demographic, fracture location, and intraoperative clinical data. All recorded data were documented, tabulated, computed, and analyzed. Statistical significance was set at the 5% level. Results: Twenty-one patients were selected and randomly allocated to 1 of 3 groups based on the fixation modality used. There were no relevant differences in demographic data for the 3 groups. There were no statistically relevant differences in clinical evaluation outcomes. However, there was a statistically significant difference in the gain of mean postoperative bone density between the HBS and MP groups (P =.012) and between the LS and MP groups (P =.045), but not between the HBS and LS groups. Conclusion: Cannulated HBS osteosynthesis provides a successful and minimally invasive treatment modality for the management of anterior mandibular fractures.

An Effective Technique in Treatment of Femoral Neck Fractures - Ostheosynthesis under Double Fluoroscopic Guidance	ACTA CHIRURGIAE ORTHOPAEDICAE ET TRAUMATOLOGIAE CECHOSLOVACA			English	Article						double fluoroscopy; femoral neck fractures; radiation; osteosynthesis; cannulated screw	INTERNAL-FIXATION; SCREW FIXATION; RISK-FACTORS; OUTCOMES; ADULTS; HEAD	PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The most commonly used technique for fixation of the femoral neck fractures is percutaneous osteosynthesis with cannulated screw under fluoroscopy guidance. Osteosynthesis performed under single-fluoroscopic guidance requires continuous repositioning the fluoroscope to obtain biplane imaging. This study aimed to evaluate whether there is a statistically significant difference between the osteosynthesis procedures performed under guidance of single-fluoroscopy and double fluoroscopy with respect to radiation emission safety and treatment parameters for fixation of femoral neck fractures. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study included 35 patients operated for femoral neck fracture between December 2013 and October 2017. Osteosynthesis was performed in 21 of these patients using cannulated screw under guidance of single-fluoroscopy whereas other 14 patients underwent same type of osteosynthesis assisted by double-fluoroscopy. The parameters of these two groups such as duration of surgery preparation, duration of the surgery, duration of radiation exposure, collo-diaphyseal angle and Harris hip score values were recorded. RESULTS No significant difference was found between the groups regarding time for surgery preparation (p > 0.05). On the other hand, duration of surgery and overall duration of radiation exposure were found 14 (p < 0.05) and 15 (p < 0.05) minutes shorter in the double-fluoroscopy group, respectively. No significant difference was found between the groups in terms of collo-diaphyseal angle and Harris hip score values (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Use of double-fluoroscopy significantly reduces time of surgical duration and also level of radiation exposure in surgery of femoral neck fractures.

This retrospective cohort study aimed to compare percutaneous cannulated screw (PCS) fixation and plating with a minimally invasive longitudinal approach (MILA) after closed reduction for the treatment of tongue-type calcaneal fractures. Materials and MethodsA total of 77 patients with intra-articular tongue-type calcaneal fractures between September 2015 and July 2019 were included in this study. They were randomly allocated into two groups: PCS fixation (n = 32) and MILA (n = 45). The outcome measures included demographic variables, operation time (OT), preoperative time (POT), hospital stay time (HST), blood loss, visual analog scale (VAS) scores, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot scores, postoperative complications, and imaging parameters. The patients were clinically examined at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, with a final follow-up period of 27 months. ResultsNo significant differences were observed during the follow-up in calcaneal length, height, Gissane's and Bohler's angles, VAS scores, AOFAS hindfoot scores, or complication rates between the two groups. However, the postoperative VAS scores in the PCS group were significantly lower than those in the MILA group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the OT, POT, and HST in the PCS group were significantly shorter than those in the MILA group (p < 0.05). Blood loss was lower in the PCS group than those in the other group (p = 0.044). However, postoperative calcaneal widening was significantly smaller in the MILA group than that in the PCS group (p < 0.001). ConclusionsAfter closed reduction for the treatment of tongue-type calcaneal fractures, PCS fixation was superior to MILA in terms of OT, POT, HST, blood loss, pain, and degree of comfort. Meanwhile, MILA has the advantage of restoring the calcaneal width. Under the same rehabilitation program, the two approaches showed similar abilities in maintaining the closed reduction.

J	Naik, P; Nagda, T; Patwardhan, S				Naik, Premal; Nagda, Taral; Patwardhan, Sandeep			Role of Percutaneous Screw Fixation in Children with Delayed Presentation and Nonunion of Lateral Condyle Humerus Fractures with Elbow Stiffness	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article; Early Access						Lateral condyle of humerus fractures in children; Delayed presentation; Nonunion of lateral condyle humerus fractures; Nonunion; Percutaneous screw fixation; Elbow stiffness	SLIGHTLY DISPLACED FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; IN-SITU; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; MANAGEMENT; PREVENTION	Introduction Delayed presentations and nonunion of lateral condyle of Humerus (LCH) fractures in children are common. It is recommended to gain elbow movements before placing single screw for late presenting LCH fractures. We examined the efficacy of a percutaneously placed screw in delayed presenting LCH fractures and LCH nonunion in children who presented with varying degree of elbow stiffness without waiting for improvement in elbow movements. Material and Methods Sixteen children with LCH fractures presenting after six weeks of fracture, without signs of union, and with frank nonunion were treated with percutaneous placement of the cancellous screw. There was a delay of 1.5 to18 months before presenting to us. The results were assessed by Dhillon criteria. Results All the patients at presentation had flexion deformity (avg 29(0)) and restricted flexion ((avg 100(0)). Successful radiological union was achieved in fifteen patients. All the patients had full recovery of extension. Fifteen patient regained full flexion and one patient has only 10(0) flexion restriction (p value < 0.001). At the final follow-up, fifteen patients had excellent and one had a good overall Dhillon score. There was no clinically evident varus or valgus deformity. Conclusion We could achieve union in a majority of the patients with delayed presentation and established nonunion of LCH fractures with simple percutaneous screw placement, thereby avoiding open surgery, big scar, bone grafting, and AVN of LCH. We did not wait for an improvement in elbow movements before screw fixation and still all our patients regained full elbow movements with improved Dhillon scores.

Screw fixation of radial head fractures: Compression screw versus lag screw-A biomechanical comparison	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Radial head; Elbow; Fracture; Osteosynthesis; Biomechanics; Screws; Stability	INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; NECK FRACTURES; BONE SCREWS; STABILITY; NONUNION; EXCISION; MODEL; ELBOW; ARTHROPLASTY	Introduction: Secondary loss of reduction and pseudarthrosis due to unstable fixation methods remain challenging problems of surgical stabilisation of radial head fractures. The purpose of our study was to determine whether the 3.0 mm Headless Compression Screw (HCS) provides superior stability to the standard 2.0 mm cortical screw (COS). Materials and methods: Eight pairs of fresh frozen human cadaveric proximal radii were used for this paired comparison. A standardised Mason II-Fracture was created with a fragment size of 1/3 of the radial head's articular surface that was then stabilised either with two 3.0 mm HCS (Synthes) or two 2.0 mm COS (Synthes) according to a randomisation protocol. The specimens were then loaded axially and transversely with 100 N each for 4 cycles. Cyclic loading with 1000 cycles as well as failure load tests were performed. The Wilcoxon test was used to assess statistically significant differences between the two groups. Results: No statistical differences could be detected between the two fixation methods. Under axial loads the COS showed a displacement of 0.32 mm vs. 0.49 mm for the HCS. Under transverse loads the displacement was 0.25 mm for the COS vs. 0.58 mm for the HCS group. After 1000 cycles of axial loading there were still no significant differences. The failure load for the COS group was 291 N and 282 N for the HCS group. Conclusion: No significant differences concerning the stability achieved by 3.0 mm HCS and the 2.0 mm COS could be detected in the experimental setup presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was: 1) to evaluate the clinical use L.I.S.S plating system for stabilization of bicondylar tibial plateau fractures. 2) To compare the biomechanics of this plating system with a double plate construct. Methods and Materials. Thirty-eight patients who sustained a complex tibial plateau fracture (OTA type 41C) at one of three level-one trauma centers were stabilized using the Less Invasive Stabilization System (L.I.S.S.). The cohort of patients was evaluated clinically and radiographically for outcomes at a mean 15 months. In phase 2 of this study a model of a bicondylar tibial plateau fractures was made in six matched pairs of embalmed, human tibia and randomized to fixation with either a L.I.S.S plate or a standard double plate construct. The tibias were then subjected to an axial cyclic load of 500N for 10(5) cycles (3Hz) to approximate 2 months in vivo and displacements measured. Results. Thirty-six of /38 (95%) patients united at 4 months after surgery with no loss of fixation nor infection. Two patients underwent prophylactic autogenous bone grafting for bone loss and united by 3 months postgrafting. Significant loss of knee range of motion (<90(0)) was seen in five patients. Biomechanically, no differences in permanent inferior displacement of the medial fragment were found in initial axial loading and after 105 cycles between the two plate constructs. However, when loaded to 500N the L.I.S.S plate construct demonstrated almost twice the displacement of the medial fragment compared with the dual plate construct. No specimen lost fixation during cycling. Conclusion: The L.I.S.S plating system provides stable fixation of complex bicondylar tibial plateau fractures allowing early range of knee motion with favorable clinical results.

French Arthroscopic Soc	Preliminary clinical outcomes of Latarjet-Patte coracoid transfer by arthroscopy vs. open surgery: Prospective multicentre study of 390 cases	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Coracoid bone block; Techniques; Range of motion; Apprehension; Scores	COMPLICATIONS	Background: The Latarjet-Patte procedure consisting in transfer and screw fixation of the coracoid process to the anterior glenoid is a treatment of reference for anterior shoulder instability. Over time, surgical innovations translated into a number of improvements and, in late 2003, an arthroscopically assisted variant of the procedure was described. Objective: To evaluate and compare clinical outcomes of the modified Latarjet-Patte procedure performed by open surgery, arthroscopy with screw fixation, or arthroscopy with endobutton fixation. Material and method: A total of 390 patients who underwent surgery to treat anterior shoulder instability between March 2013 and June 2014 were included and divided into three groups depending on whether they were managed using open surgery with screw fixation, arthroscopy with screw fixation, or arthroscopy with endobutton fixation. Clinical findings were recorded pre-operatively then 6 months post-operatively and at last follow-up (mean, 27.7 months). Range of motion and apprehension test (arm in external rotation at 0, 90, and 140 of abduction) were assessed and the Walch-Duplay and modified Rowe scores were determined. Results: Motion range restriction was minimal with all three techniques, and motion range continued to improve throughout follow-up. Apprehension in external rotation was noted at 90 of abduction in 11% of cases and at 140 of abduction in 4% of cases. The mean total Walch-Duplay score improved from 46 pre-operatively to 90.6 and the mean total modified Rowe score from 46 pre-operatively to 91.1. By statistical analysis, external rotation at 90 of abduction and internal rotation at 0 of abduction were better after open surgery, but the differences were of limited clinical significance. Recurrence was noted in 3.3% of cases, nerve injury in 0.8%, and infection in 1.5%. Conclusion: In this study, the three techniques produced similar clinical outcomes, with a stable shoulder and no joint stiffness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Bone defects are among them. Many materials have been proposed to address this problem: allograft, bone-cements and various bone substitutes (BSM). Cal-Cemex (beta-tricalciophosphate and polymethylmethacrylate) is a new hybrid bi-component BSM. A retrospective multicenter study was conducted based on the clinical experience of three European Hospitals, to demonstrate its clinical effectiveness, versatility and safety. Materials and Methods From December 2016 to March 2022, 45 displaced tibial plateau fractures were treated with internal fixation and augmentation using Cal-Cemex. The average age was 55.9 years. According to Schatzker classification, we included 13 type II, 24 type III, 3 type V and 4 type VI fractures. The postoperative follow-up (FU) consisted of clinical and radiological examinations at 6 and 12 weeks and 1 year after surgery. A CT scan was performed preoperatively and 1 year after surgery. Full weight bearing was permitted after less than 6 weeks. Clinical data were collected from patient charts, while functional data were evaluated using the Rasmussen knee function score, the KOOS score and the Hospital for Special Surgery knee rating score (HSS), to evaluate the range of motion, axis and functionality of the knee. Results The average FU was 42.8 months. CT scans taken at 1 year demonstrated a good surface osteointegration without radiolucent lines or osteolysis with good evidence of interdigitation and even bone ingrowth. At 1-year FU, the mean Rasmussen score was 24.7, the mean KOOS score was 90.7 and the mean HSS was 89.9 and the average full weight-bearing period 34.9. No patients had hardware failure or fracture secondary displacement. Discussion Cal-Cemex combines biological features and good mechanical performances. It guarantees biocompatibility and osteoconductivity, although it is not fully reabsorbable; beta-tricalciophosphate component gives macro- and microporosity that allow fluids to penetrate inside the material, to stimulate bone ingrowth. Conclusions The study suggests that Cal-Cemex is an option for tibial plateau fractures, where augmentation and support are necessary for early full weight bearing. The absence of major complications, ease of application, the possibility to cut and perforate this material support its extensive use in bone augmentation for trauma cases.

J	Arauz, JMY				Yanez Arauz, Juan Manuel			Minimally invasive treatment of AO B ankle fractures: Surgical technique and long-term outcomes	FOOT AND ANKLE SURGERY			English	Article						Ankle fractures; Fibula; MIPO; Minimally invasive surgery	PLATE OSTEOSYNTHESIS; OPERATIVE TREATMENT; COMPLICATIONS; FIXATION; FIBULA; STABILITY; COMPLEX	Background: Ankle fractures are the most common traumatic bone injuries of the lower limb. Over 50% of ankle fractures occur at the syndesmosis level (type AO B). The goal of treatment is to achieve an anatomical reduction and appropriate stabilization. The present study aimed to evaluate the clinicalfunctional and radiological results, and complications of minimally invasive reduction and fixation technique for ankle fractures type AO B. The surgical technique also is detailed. Material and methods: A prospective analysis of 451 patients undergoing surgery for type AO B displaced ankle fracture was performed. All patients were treated with minimally invasive surgery. The following times were recorded: time between trauma and osteosynthesis, hospitalization length, surgical time, and exposure time to fluoroscopy. Age and gender, mechanism of injury, and characteristics of fractures were recorded. For functional outcome, AOFAS score, VAS, and Weber score were used. Radiographic analysis was performed. The average follow-up was 112 months. Results: Mean age was 48.2 years old. Average length of stay in hospital was 5.72 h. Mean duration of the surgery was 32.8 min. Average fluoroscopic exposure time during surgery was 9.25 s. Mean bone union time was 38.2 days. Weber's score was on average 1.5/24 points and the long-term follow-up AOFAS score was on average 97.5/100. Postoperative complications incidence was 2.7%. Conclusions: Distal fibula fixation with the MIPO technique presented good functional outcomes and could be helpful in the avoidance of the complications associated with conventional open reduction and internal fixation. However, it needs more exposition to intraoperative fluoroscopy. (C) 2020 European Foot and Ankle Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The applicable elasticity of materials composing intramedullary nails remains unclear. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of the elastic property of -type titanium alloy nails on fracture healing compared with conventional Ti-6Al-4V alloy nails using a rabbit tibial osteotomy model. Two types of intramedullary nails composed of -type Ti-Nb-Sn alloy (Young's modulus: 37 GPa) or Ti-6Al-4V alloy (Young's modulus: 110 GPa) were used for osteotomy fixation in the tibiae of rabbits. At 4, 8, and 16 weeks postoperatively, microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) and three-point bending tests were performed. Micro-CT images showed that the callus volume was significantly larger in the Ti-Nb-Sn alloy group at 4 and 8 weeks. The callus bone mineral density did not differ at each time point. In mechanical testing, the maximum load was significantly higher at all time points in the Ti-Nb-Sn alloy group. Taken together, the elastic intramedullary nails composed of Ti-Nb-Sn alloy improved the mechanical properties of the bone healing site from the early phase to the remodeling phase. Adequate Young's modulus of the Ti-Nb-Sn alloy enhanced fracture union and bone strength restoration. The Ti-Nb-Sn alloy is a promising biomaterial for fracture fixation devices.

Materials and methods: A retrospective study of patients surgically treated for mandibular condylar fractures using the retromandibular transparotid approach over seven years was conducted. The primary study variable was the postoperative change in FN function after fracture fixation. Risk factors were categorized as demographic, anatomic, experience of the operator, fracture displacement/dislocation and number of miniplates placed at the fracture site. Appropriate statistics were computed. Results: Ninety patients with 102 fractures were analysed. Thirty two fractures (31%) were located in the condylar neck and 70 fractures (69%) were subcondylar (located below the sigmoid notch). The condylar segment was undisplaced in twelve cases (12%), displaced medially in thirty five (34%), laterally displaced in thirty (29%) and dislocated in 25 (24.5%). In 18 fractures (18%), postoperative examination revealed various degrees of damage to the FN. All nerve injuries recovered completely in 8-24 weeks. In a multivariate model, condylar neck fractures, fracture dislocation and operator inexperience were associated with a statistically significant risk of postoperative deterioration of FN function (P <= 0.05). Conclusion: The majority of facial nerve injuries after surgical treatment of condylar fractures by the retromandibular transparotid approach are transient in nature. Condylar neck fractures, fracture dislocation and operator inexperience were associated with an increased risk for FN injury. (C) 2014 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.

Patients and Methods: Between January 2012 and December 2012, 41 consecutive patients underwent posterior atlantoaxial fusion with a screw-rod fixation system in our spine center. The choice to use allograft or iliac crest autograft was made by the patient himself or herself after being informed about the advantages and disadvantages of both methods. In the allograft group, we used mixed material of morcellized demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft and local autograft for posterior atlantoaxial fusion. In the autograft group, we used the morcellized iliac crest autograft for fusion. Patients underwent regular follow up including CT scans and dynamic radiographs 6 months postoperatively and every 6 months thereafter until study completion or confirmation of fusion. Results: Twenty-four patients underwent posterior atlantoaxial fusion with allograft, and 17 underwent fusion with autograft. All patients were followed up for at least 24 months. At the final follow-up visit, only two (8.3%) patients in the allograft group had confirmed posterior bony fusion on CT imaging while 15 (88.2%) patients in the autograft group had confirmed posterior bony fusion. None of the 41 patients had movement on the dynamic radiographs. Conclusions: Allograft is not reliable for posterior atlantoaxial fusion even with the rigid internal fixation of modern constructs. Autograft remains the first choice for atlantoaxial fusion despite the donor-site morbidity. The assessment of fusion based on a lack of movement on dynamic radiographs is not reliable. The confirmation of fusion should be based on the presence of bridging bone on CT imaging.

Operative versus nonoperative treatment of acute undisplaced and minimally displaced scaphoid waist fractures-A systematic review	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Scaphoid fractures; Adults; Fracture fixation; Cast; Treatment; Outcome; Systematic review	PERCUTANEOUS SCREW FIXATION; CAST IMMOBILIZATION; CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT; INTERNAL-FIXATION	Introduction: Undisplaced and minimally displaced scaphoid waist fractures can be managed either operatively (percutaneous or ORIF) or non-operatively with both methods obtaining high rates of fracture union and subsequent return of function. The aim of this systematic review is to identify and evaluate the best available evidence to determine whether they should be managed operatively or non-operatively. Materials and methods: A Medline and journal hand search was performed with strict eligibility criteria to obtain the highest quality evidence from meta-analyses, randomised controlled trials (RCT) and further appraised using a scoring tool. Results: The search found 112 studies, of which 12 met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. Three level 1 RCTs, three level 2 RCTs, two meta-analyses, one economic analysis, and three retrospective studies were critically appraised. The evidence suggests that percutaneous fixation may result in faster union rates by approximately 5 weeks and an earlier return to sport and work by approximately 7 weeks over cast treatment. This difference is not seen when comparing ORIF with cast treatment. Although cast treatment results in a higher non-union rate than ORIF, this needs to be balanced with the 30% minor complication rate. Manual workers require significantly longer time off work than non-manual workers regardless of the method of treatment, although they did return to work sooner after ORIF than after cast treatment. Conclusion: The majority of these injuries can be treated in a cast with good results. Operative treatment should be reserved for patients unable to work in a cast and considered for most manual workers and high-level athletes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cannulated Screw Fixation of Jones Fifth Metatarsal Fractures: A Comparison of Titanium and Stainless Steel Screw Fixation	JOURNAL OF FOOT & ANKLE SURGERY			English	Article						biomechanics; injury; ORIF; nonunion; surgery; trauma	PROXIMAL 5TH METATARSAL; SURGICAL-MANAGEMENT; BASE; TUBEROSITY; JUNCTION; DISTAL	The classic Jones fracture involves the fifth metatarsal at the level of the proximal diaphyseal-metaphyseal junction. The mainstay of surgical treatment for the Jones fracture is intramedullary screw fixation. There is no consensus of the type or material of screw that should be used. The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to test the hypothesis that there is no clinical difference in the incidence of healing, or complications, when comparing stainless steel to titanium cannulated screws used in Jones fracture open-reduction internal fixation (ORIF). Data were collected on a total of 53 patients (fractures) that were fixed with either cannulated titanium screws (Ti group) or cannulated stainless steel screws (SS group). The postoperative protocol was standardized. The mean time to radiographic union was 11.7 +/- 5.1 weeks in the Ti group and 13.4 +/- 5.7 weeks in the SS group (P - .333). The overall union rate for the Ti group was 36/37 (97%) and 14/16 (88%) in the SS group (P = .213). Complications were rare in both groups, and the prevalence was not statistically significantly different (P > .05). There was 1 patient with an asymptomatic radiographic nonunion in the Ti group, and this patient elected not to undergo revision. There were 2 nonunions in the SS group. One was revised and went on to heal and the other is awaiting revision. Our study has demonstrated the decision to use stainless steel or titanium can be left to patient constraints, such as allergies, or physician preference without compromising the clinical result.

Locking Nail versus Plate Fixation in Calcaneal Fractures: Brief report on a Retrospective Analysis of Treatment Characteristics and Radiographic Correction Potential	ACTA CHIRURGIAE ORTHOPAEDICAE ET TRAUMATOLOGIAE CECHOSLOVACA			English	Article						calcaneus fracture; sinus tarsi approach; calcaneal nail; C-Nail	MINIMALLY INVASIVE REDUCTION; EXTENSILE LATERAL APPROACH; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OSTEOSYNTHESIS	PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Minimal and limited access techniques are gaining increasing interest for the treatment of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures. The ideal treatment method is however still debated and largely based on individual case factors and surgeon experience. Aim of this study was thus to compare the treatment characteristics and radiographic correction potential of a locking nail system with a sinus tarsi approach to plate fixation via an extended lateral approach. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 39 cases of patients with calcaneal fractures that received primary fracture treatment for displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures between July 2017 and March 2020. Patient characteristics, time to surgery, time to discharge, OR time and the correction achieved were analyzed and comparative statistics performed. RESULTS In total 19 patients treated with the locking nail and 20 patients treated with plate fixation were analyzed. Patient age and fracture severity according to the Sanders classification were comparable between the groups. Overall surgical time, as well as the achieved reduction was equal between both groups. Time to surgery, as well as time from surgery to discharge was significantly shorter in the locking nail group. 2 additional soft tissue procedures were necessary in the extended lateral approach group. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The results with the locking calcaneus nail and sinus tarsi approach suggest, that similar treatment results can be achieved as with plate osteosynthesis and an extended lateral approach. Soft tissue management, as well as pre- and postoperative timing and discharge management can be improved with the nail. Further controlled trials comparing the long-term outcome between the treatment options are needed.	[Stachel, N.] Saarland Univ Hosp, Dept Orthopaed & Orthopaed Surg, Homburg, Germany; [Braun, B.

Objective: To describe a novel reconstruction strategy using a T-shaped titanium mesh cage with posterior cervical screw-rod fixation after total spondylectomy of axis tumors. Summary of Background Data: Instability of the upper cervical spine because of tumors in axis (C2) often results in devastating complications. Surgical resection and reconstruction after spondylectomy of C2 remain a technical challenge because of the intricate anatomies, vital adjacent tissues, and the unique spinal biomechanics in this special region. Materials and Methods: The novel reconstruction mode included the construction of the anterior aspect conducted with a specially made titanium mesh cage and the posterior cervical fixation only. Patients who received total C2 tumors spondylectomy and reconstruction with this novel mode in our center between January 2009 and December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of this novel reconstruction method. Results: A total of 24 patients with C2 tumor received total spondylectomy and the new mode of local reconstruction. The neurological deficits recovered well and local pain relieved significantly (P < 0.001) during the mean follow-up time of 22 months. Perioperative complications were rare and controllable. No internal fixation failure occurred. The mobility of the occipital-cervical junction was largely preserved in all patients. Conclusions: This novel reconstruction mode using an anterior "T-shaped" mesh cage with posterior screw-rod fixation provides satisfactory stability and motion of occipital-cervical junction with limited complications, and therefore may prove to be an ideal option for management of C2 tumors.

Therefore, mechanical and clinical studies were performed in patients over the age of 50 to test the strength of augmentation of separate vertical wiring with cerclage wire (i.e., combined technique). Materials and Methods: Multiple osteotomies were performed to create four-part fractures in the inferior poles of eight pairs of cadaveric patellae. One patella from each pair was fixed with the separate wiring technique, while the other patella was fixed with a combined technique. The ultimate load to failure and stiffness of the fixation were subsequently measured. In a clinical study of 21 patients (average age of 64 years), comminuted fractures of the inferior pole of the patellae were treated using the combined technique: Operative parameters were recorded from which post-operative outcomes were evaluated. Results: For cadaveric patellae, whose mean age was 69 years, the mean ultimate loads to failure for the separate vertical wiring technique and the combined technique were 216.4 +/- 72.4 N and 324.9 +/- 50.6 N, respectively (p=0.012). The mean stiffness for the separate vertical wiring technique and the combined technique was 241.1 +/- 68.5 N/mm and 340.8 +/- 45.3 N/mm, respectively (p=0.012). In the clinical study, the mean clinical score at final follow-up was 28.1 points. Conclusion: Augmentation of separate vertical wiring with cerclage wire provides enough strength for protected early exercise of the knee joint and uneventful healing.

J	Luchetti, R				Luchetti, R			Corrective osteotomy of malunited distal radius fractures using carbonated hydroxyapatite as an alternative to autogenous bone grafting	JOURNAL OF HAND SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME			English	Article						bone graft substitute; corrective osteotomy; distal radius malunion; carbonated hydroxyapatite	CALCIUM-PHOSPHATE; CEMENT; FIXATION; END	Purpose: The purpose of the present study was to report on the author's experience using carbonated hydroxyapatite as a bony substitute in distal radius corrective osteotomies. Methods: Six patients had a corrective osteotomy for a malunited distal radius fracture using carbonated hydroxyapatite as an alternative to an autogenous bone graft. internal fixation of the osteotomy was achieved by using 2 or 3 K-wires. Results: At an average follow-up evaluation of 33 months (range, 22-45 mo) all the osteotomies united. Wrist flexion-extension motion improved from 75degrees to 110degrees, forearm rotation increased from 116degrees to 157degrees, and grip strength had an average increase of 140% at the time of the final follow-up evaluation. All patients were satisfied and there were no reports of persistent pain. Radiographic evaluation showed an average volar tilt improvement from a preoperative dorsal angulation shifting into a neutral position in the sagittal plane; radial lengthening improved from an average of 4 mm (range, 2-6 mm) before surgery to 7 mm (range, 5-9 mm) after surgery, ulnar plus deformity improved by 5 mm. Radiographically the carbonated hydroxyapatite material was integrated completely into the bone tissue with evidence of progressive re-absorption and bony calcification over time. The Mayo wrist score system, according to Cooney and Krimmer modifications, improved by an average of 88 and 98 points (0-100 points), respectively. Conclusions: On the basis of this preliminary experience it is reasonable to consider carbonated hydroxyapatite as a viable alternative to bone grafting in conjunction with surgical correction of a distal radius malunion. It must be augmented, however, with internal fixation. Copyright (C) 2004 by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand.

The control parameters of plating, such as geometries, material properties, and physical constraints of the LCP components, affect basic functions associated with the bone fixation, including the extent of stress shielding and subsequent bone remodeling, strength and stability of the bone-LCP construct, and performance of secondary bone healing. The main objectives of this research were as follows: (1) to find the appropriate values of control parameters of an LCP construct to achieve the optimized performance throughout bone healing; and (2) to unravel relationships between LCP parameters and the LCP's performance. Different values for the plate/screw modulus of elasticity (E), plate width (W), plate thickness (T), screw diameter (D), bone-plate offset (O), and screw configuration (C), as six control parameters, were considered at five different levels. Taguchi method was adopted to create trial combinations of control parameters and determining the best set of parameters, which can optimize the overall performance of the LCP. All design cases were analyzed using the finite element method. The optimal set of control parameters consisting of 150 GPa, 12 mm, 4 mm, 5.5 mm, 2 mm, and 123,678 were determined for E, W, T, D, O, and C, respectively. Furthermore, ANOVA was used to rank the most influential parameters on each function of the LCP fixation. In the overall performance of the LCP fixation, E, D, T, C, W, and O showed a contribution percentage of 46%, 22%, 10%, 11%, 8%, and 3%, respectively.

JOURNAL OF CRANIO-MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article						Osteosynthesis; Headless cannulated Herbert screw; Mandibular angle fracture	INTERNAL-FIXATION; INTERFRAGMENTARY COMPRESSION; BIOMECHANICAL EVALUATION; PLATING TECHNIQUES; BONE SCREWS; STABILITY; FORCES; MANAGEMENT; LOCKING; NUMBER	Introduction: Fractures of the mandibular angle are a common type of facial skull fracture. Although operative treatment includes a wide range of fixation techniques, a definite gold standard method has yet to be established. Headless, cannulated Herbert screws, often used in many forms of minimally invasive trauma surgery, provide functional and stable fracture fixation. Materials and methods: In a prospective, double-randomised, controlled, parallel-group designed, in vitro trial, the biomechanical behaviour of the Herbert bone screw system was compared to that of a conventional locking plate system in 40 mandibular angle fractures of human mandible cadaver phantoms. Results: The mean stress values were 250 (+/- 68.0) N in the plate subgroup and 200 (+/- 61.0) N in the screw subgroup. The respective mean strain values were 7.90 (+/- 2.7) mm and 6.90 (+/- 2.2) mm, and the respective mean stiffness were values 1.10 (+/- 0.61) N/m and 0.78 (+/- 0.40) N/m. The differences in the results obtained using the two treatments were not significant (p = 0.55). Conclusions: The biomechanical behaviour of the two fixation systems within the tested loads did not significantly differ with respect to postoperative parameters clinically relevant in osteosynthesis. Both systems met the mandibular angle assessment criterion, which is considered to be sufficient for clinical use. The results indicate the potential clinical utility of these two systems, and recommend further testing. (C) 2017 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Outcome of the Intramedullary Diaphyseal Segmental Defect Fixation System for Bone Tumors	JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY			English	Article						intercalary prostheses; bone tumors; limb salvage surgery; intramedullary diaphyseal segmental defect fixation system	ENDOPROSTHETIC REPLACEMENT; DISTRACTION OSTEOGENESIS; INTERCALARY ALLOGRAFTS; MASSIVE ALLOGRAFTS; EXTERNAL FIXATOR; LIMB SALVAGE; MESH CAGE; FOLLOW-UP; RECONSTRUCTION; RESECTION	Background: Resection of diaphyseal malignant bone tumors is indicated for local control and impending pathological fracture or failure of prophylactic internal fixation. However, there are no large, long-term studies analyzing the results of intercalary reconstruction using segmental metallic spacers. Materials and Methods: We present 24 patients treated with wide resection for primary or metastatic bone tumors involving the diaphysis of the femur, tibia, or humerus and reconstruction using a modular intramedullary diaphyseal segmental defect fixation system. The mean length of bone resection was 10 cm. The postoperative complications and outcome were evaluated. Results: At a mean follow-up of 29 months, 17 patients were alive and 7 patients were dead of disease; no patient had local recurrence. Implant-related complications occurred in 8 patients, the most common being mechanical loosening and rotational instability. Loosening was most common in reconstructions of more than 10 cm length of bone resection. In all femoral reconstructions, mechanical failure occurred at the proximal stem. True limb length discrepancy of 2.0 cm was observed in one patient. Wound healing complications were not observed; range of motion and function of the adjacent joints was within normal limits. Conclusions: The modularity, ease of application and preservation of the adjacent joints are major advantages of segmental modular prostheses; however, the complications' rate is high. Complications occur most often at the proximal stem in femoral reconstructions and reconstructions for more than 10 cm length of bone resection. In these cases, the use of these implants should be reconsidered or not recommended. J. Surg. Oncol. 2011;104:83-90. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

However, the functional outcome of fractures involving the posterior tibial plafond is often poor. We describe the morbidity and functional outcome for plate fixation of the displaced posterior malleolus using a posterolateral approach. Materials and Methods: The posterolateral approach was used for osteosynthesis of the posterior malleolus in 45 consecutive patients (median age 54 years) with AO/Muller-classification type 44-A3 (n = 1), 44-1133 (n = 35), 44-Cl (n = 7), and 44-C2 (n = 2) ankle fractures. Thirty-three of the patients suffered complete fracture dislocation. Functional outcome at followup was measured using the modified Weber protocol and the standardized AAOS foot and ankle questionnaire. Radiological evaluation employed standardized anterior-posterior and lateral views. Results: The fragment comprised a median of 24% (range, 10% to 48%) of the articular surface. Postoperative soft tissue problems were encountered in five patients (11%), one of whom required revision surgery. Two patients (4%) developed Stage I complex regional pain syndrome. Clinical and radiological followup at 25 months disclosed no secondary displacement of the fixed fragment. The median foot and ankle score was 93 (range, 58 to 100), shoe comfort score was 77 (range, 0 to 100). A median score of 7 (range, 5 to 16) was documented using the modified Weber protocol. Conclusion: The posterolateral approach allowed good exposure and stable fixation of a displaced posterior malleolar fragment with few local complications. The anatomical repositioning and stable fixation led to good functional and subjective outcome.

Of these, over 40% are considered unstable and require some form of fixation. In recent years with the advent of low profile plating, open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using volar plates has become the surgical treatment of choice in many hospitals. However, it is currently unknown which plating system has the lowest complication rate and/or superior clinical and radiological outcomes following surgery. Few studies have compared different types of plates, which may have various features, different plate and screw designs or may be manufactured from different materials (for example, stainless steel or titanium). This study will specifically investigate and compare the clinical and radiological outcomes and complication rates of two commonly used volar plating systems for fixation of distal radius fractures: one made from stainless steel (Trimed (TM) Volar Plate, Trimed (TM), California, USA) and the other made from titanium (Medartis (R) Aptus Volar Plate, Medartis (R), Basel, Switzerland). The primary aim of this study is to determine if there is a difference on the Patient Reported Wrist Evaluation six months following ORIF using a volar plate for adult patients with a distal radius fracture. Methods/Design: This study will implement a randomized prospective clinical trial study design evaluating the outcomes of two different types of volar plates: one plate manufactured from stainless steel (Trimed (TM) Volar Plate) and one plate manufactured from titanium (Medartis (R) Aptus Volar Plate). The surgery will be performed at a major trauma hospital in Brisbane, Australia. Outcome measures including function, adverse events, range of movement, strength, disability, radiological findings and health-related quality of life will be collected at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months following surgery. A parallel economic analysis will also be performed. This randomized clinical trial is due to deliver results in December 2016. Discussion: Results from this trial will contribute to the evidence on operative management of distal radius fractures and plate material type.

Preventing varus collapse in proximal humerus fracture fixation: 90-90 dual plating versus endosteal fibular allograft strut	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Humerus fracture; Humerus fixation; Dual plating; Proximal humerus fracture; Fibular allograft; 90-90 configuration	INTERNAL-FIXATION; MEDIAL SUPPORT; COMPLICATIONS; AUGMENTATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; TRENDS; GRAFT	Introduction Screw cut out and varus collapse are the most common complication of locked plate fixation of proximal humerus fractures. The purpose of this study was to compare dual plating and endosteal fibular allograft struts as augmentation strategies to prevent varus collapse.Materials and methods A trapezoidal osteotomy was created at the metaphysis to create a 2-part proximal humerus model in 18 paired shoulder specimens. Each specimen was assigned to group A, B, or C and was fixed with either a lateral locking plate, a lateral locking plate and anterior one-third tubular plate in an orthogonal 90/90 configuration, or a lateral locking plate with intramedullary fibular strut, respectively. The specimens were stressed in axial compression to failure. Displacement, elastic limit, ultimate load, and stiffness were recorded and calculated.Results There was no difference in mean cyclic displacement between the three groups (0.71 mm vs 0.89 mm vs 0.61 mm for Group A, B, C, respectively). Lateral plating demonstrated the greatest absolute and relative displacement at the elastic limit (5.3 mm +/- 1.5 and 4.4 mm +/- 1.3) without significance. The elastic limit or yield point was greatest for fibular allograft, Group C (1223 N +/- 501 vs 1048 N +/- 367 for Group B and 951 N +/- 249 for Group A) without significance.Conclusions Dual plating of proximal humerus fractures in a 90-90 configuration demonstrates similar biomechanical properties as endosteal fibular strut allograft. Both strategies demonstrate superior stiffness to isolated lateral locked plating.	[Patel, Ravi; Brown, Justin R. R.; Miles, Jon W. W.; Dornan, Grant J.

Biomechanical comparison of distal femoral fracture fixation: Analysis of non-locked, locked, and far-cortical locked constructs	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH			English	Article						femoral fracture; locked plate; nonlocked plate; plate fixation; stiffness	LOCKING PLATE FIXATION; FEMUR FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; COMPRESSION PLATE; IMPLANT MATERIAL; MANAGEMENT; PLACEMENT; STABILITY; STIFFNESS; BONE	To assess whether far-cortical locking (FCL) screws alter the fracture site strain environment and allow shorter bridge plate constructs for supracondylar femoral fractures, we tested the fracture site displacement under force of synthetic left femora with a 5-cm metaphyseal fracture gap, modeling comminution. Five models of nine constructs were tested (three types of diaphyseal screws [nonlocking, locking, and FCL] and two plate lengths [13 holes and 5 holes]). Long plate models using three or four diaphyseal screws (working length 13.5 or 7.5 cm, respectively) were compared with short plates with three diaphyseal screws (working length 7.5 cm). Models were loaded axially and torsionally; 100 cycles in random order. Primary outcome measures were axial and torsional fracture site stiffness. FCL screws decreased rotational stiffness 19% (P < .01) compared with baseline nonlocking screws in the same plate and working length construct, mirroring the effect (20% decrease in stiffness,P < .01) of nearly doubling the nonlocking construct working length (7.5-13.5 cm). Similarly, FCL screws decreased axial stiffness 23% (P < .01) in the same baseline comparison. Fracture site displacement under loading comparable to a long working length nonlocked plate construct was achieved using a shorter FCL plate construct. By closely replicating the biomechanical properties of a long plate construct, a fracture site strain environment considered favorable in promoting fracture healing might still be achievable using a shorter plate length. Clinical Significance: It might be possible to optimize fracture site strain environment and displacement under loading using shorter FCL plate constructs. Orthopaedic Research Society.

Intra-operative fluoroscopy is required, and despite various described imaging strategies, it is debatable as to which combination of fluoroscopic views provides the most accurate and reliable assessment of screw position.Materials and methodsUsing five synthetic pelvic models, an experimental setup was created in which the anterior acetabular columns were instrumented with screws in five distinct trajectories. Five fluoroscopic images were obtained of each model (Pelvic Inlet, Obturator Oblique, Iliac Oblique, Obturator Oblique/Outlet, and Iliac Oblique/Outlet). The images were presented to 32 pelvic and acetabular orthopaedic surgeons, who were asked to draw two conclusions regarding screw position: (1) whether the screw was intra-articular and (2) whether the screw was intraosseous in its distal course through the bony corridor.ResultsIn the assessment of screw position relative to the hip joint, accuracy of surgeon's response ranged from 52% (iliac oblique/outlet) to 88% (obturator oblique), with surgeon confidence in the interpretation ranging from 60% (pelvic inlet) to 93% (obturator oblique) (P<0.0001). In the assessment of intraosseous position of the screw, accuracy of surgeon's response ranged from 40% (obturator oblique/outlet) to 79% (iliac oblique/outlet), with surgeon confidence in the interpretation ranging from 66% (iliac oblique) to 88% (pelvic inlet) (P<0.0001).ConclusionsThe obturator oblique and obturator oblique/outlet views afforded the most accurate and reliable assessment of penetration into the hip joint, and intraosseous position of the screw was most accurately assessed with pelvic inlet and iliac oblique/outlet views.EvidenceClinical Question	[Matheus Guimaraes, Joao Antonio; da Silva, Flavio Ribeiro] Natl Inst Traumatol & Orthoped, Orthoped Trauma Ctr, Ave Brasil 500, BR-20940070 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Matheus Guimaraes, Joao Antonio; Leite Duarte, Maria Eugenia; Cavalcanti, Amanda dos Santos; Perini Machado, Jamila Alessandra] Natl Inst Traumatol & Orthoped, Div Res, Ave Brasil 500, BR-20940070 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Martin, Murphy P.; Mauffrey, Cyril; Rojas, David] Denver Hlth Med Ctr, Dept Orthopaed Surg, 777 Bannock St, Denver, CO 80204 USA	Denver Health Medical Center	Guimaraes, JAM (corresponding author), Natl Inst Traumatol & Orthoped, Orthoped Trauma Ctr, Ave Brasil 500, BR-20940070 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.; Guimaraes, JAM (corresponding author), Natl Inst Traumatol & Orthoped, Div Res, Ave Brasil 500, BR-20940070 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.	jmatheusguimaraes@gmail.com	rojas, david/E-4020-2012; Guimaraes, Joao/KHV-5073-2024	Rojas, David/0000-0002-0619-8818; Guimaraes, Joao Antonio Matheus/0000-0002-4088-044X; Cavalcanti, Amanda/0000-0002-8792-7524					25	10	15	0	1	SPRINGER	NEW YORK	233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA	0341-2695	1432-5195		INT ORTHOP	Int.

The comminuted midshaft clavicle fracture: A biomechanical evaluation of plating methods	CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS			English	Article						Clavicle; Surgery; Biomechanics; Computational model	NONUNION; FIXATION; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; COMPLICATIONS; MALUNIONS	Background: The optimal plate location and fixation method for midshaft fractures of the clavicle remains undetermined. The objective of this study was to develop a realistic biomechanical model with which to compare superior with inferior-medial plate placement, and the failure resistance of locked and against non-locked constructs. Methods: We estimated implant loads for operated patients in early rehabilitation utilising 3-D mathematical model of the shoulder. During simulation of upper limb motion associated with eating, the fracture opened in an inferior and frontal direction. The peak X, Y, and Z loads from the simulation were reproduced using a materials testing machine. A one centimetre transverse osteectomy was created at the midshaft of forty composite clavicles. Each specimen was then fixed with either (1) non-locked superior plating (n = 10), (2) locked superior plating (n = 10), (3) non-locked inferior-medial plating (n = 10), or (4) locked inferior-medial plating (n = 10). Specimens were loaded at 20 N/s in four-point bending for 50 cycles to the peak X. Y, Z moment obtained from the computational model (-3.50, 2.46, and -1.00 Nm), then loaded to failure at 20 N/s. Findings: Inferior-medial unlocked plates were significantly stiffer than superior locked plates (P = 0.046). Interpretation: Operative fixation of midshaft clavicle fractures is controversial, though becoming more widely accepted. Few biomechanical data are available to assist surgical decision-making. Inferior plates may be better equipped to resist the in vivo loads experienced by the clavicle during early rehabilitation after internal fixation, particularly during the shoulder flexion motions associated with eating.

Adequate visualization of some acetabular fracture types may necessitate extensile or combined anterior and posterior approaches. Simultaneous anterior iliofemoral and posterior Kocher-Langenbeck (K-L) exposures with two surgical teams have also been described. To assess whether modified Kocher-Langenbeck (K-L) approach can substitute standard K-L approach in the management of elementary acetabular fractures other than the anterior wall and anterior column fractures and complement anterior surgical approaches in the management of complex acetabular fractures. Materials and Methods: 20 patients with transverse and associated acetabular fractures requiring posterior exposure were included in this prospective study. In 9 cases (7 transverse, 1 transverse with posterior wall, and 1 posterior column with posterior wall), stabilization was done through modified K-L approach. In 11 cases (3 transverse and 8 associated fractures), initial stabilization through iliofemoral approach was followed by modified K-L approach. Results: The average operative time was 183 min for combined approach and 84 min for modified K-L approach. The postoperative reduction was anatomical in 17 patients and imperfect in 3 patients. The radiological outcome was excellent in 15, good in 4, and poor in one patient. The clinical outcome was excellent in 15, good in 3 and fair and poor in 1 each according to modified Merle d'Aubigne and Postel scoring system. Conclusion: We believe that modified K-L approach may be a good alternative for the standard K-L approach in the management of elementary fractures and associated fractures of the acetabulum when combined with an anterior surgical approach. It makes the procedure less invasive, shortens the operative time, minimizes blood loss and overcomes the exhaustion and fatigue of the surgical team.

However, this approach has not yet been described in relation to fracture reduction of the distal radius. The aim of this study was to assess the technical and logistical feasibility of computer-assisted surgery in a clinical setting using PSI for fracture reduction and fixation. Materials and Methods: Five patients with varied fracture patterns of the distal radius underwent operative treatment with using PSI. The first applied PSI guide allowed specific and accurate placement of Kirschner wires inside the multiple fragments, with subsequent concurrent reduction using a second guide. Results: Planning, printing of the guides, and operations were performed within 5.6 days on average (range of 1-10 days). All patients could be treated within a reasonable period of time, demonstrating good outcomes, and were able to return to work after a follow-up of three months. Mean wrist movements (degrees) were 58 (standard deviation (SD) 21) in flexion, 62 (SD 15) in extension, 73 (SD 4) in pronation and 74 (SD 10) in supination at a minimum follow-up of 6 months. Conclusions: Three-dimensional planned osteosynthesis using PSI for treatment of distal radius fractures is feasible and facilitates reduction of multiple fracture fragments. However, higher costs must be taken into consideration for this treatment.

ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Pubic symphysis diastasis; Plating; Implant failure; Functional outcome	PELVIC RING; INTERNAL-FIXATION; TRAUMATIC DIASTASIS; STABILITY; DISRUPTIONS; FAILURE	Introduction Open reduction and internal fixation with plates is the most widespread surgery in traumatic pubic symphysis diastasis. However, implant failure or recurrent diastasis was commonly observed during follow-up. The aim of our study was to evaluate the radiologic findings and clinical outcomes. Materials and methods Sixty-five patients with traumatic pubic symphysis diastasis treated with plating between 2008 and 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. The exclusion criteria were a history of malignancy and age under 20 years. Radiographic outcomes were determined by radiograph findings, including pubic symphysis distance (PSD) and implant failure. Clinical outcomes were assessed according to the Majeed score at the final follow-up. Results Twenty-eight patients were finally included. Nine patients (32%) experienced implant failure, including four (14%) with screw loosening and five (18%) with plate breakage. Only one patient underwent revision surgery. Postoperatively, a significant increase in PSD was observed at 3 months and 6 months. Postoperative PSD was not significantly different between patients with single plating and double plating, but it was significantly greater in the implant-failure group than in the non-failure group. The Majeed score was similar between patients with single plating and double plating or between the implant-failure group and the non-failure group. Body mass index, number of plates, age, and initial injured PSD were not significantly different between the implant-failure group and the non-failure group. Only a significant male predominance was observed in the implant-failure group. Conclusion A gradual increase in the symphysis distance and a high possibility of implant failure may be the distinguishing features of traumatic pubic symphysis diastasis fixation. The postoperative symphyseal distance achieved stability after 6 months, even after implant failure. Radiographic outcomes, such as increased symphysis distance, screw loosening, and plate breakage, did not affect clinical functional outcomes.

In the recent years, upper extremity fractures and their operative treatment have increased in children. Nevertheless, the trends of humeral shaft fractures are not clear. Materials and Methods: All children aged <16 years, with a humeral shaft fracture in the geographical catchment area of Northern Finland Hospital District, with a yearly child population-at-risk of similar to 86 000 from the year 2001 until the end of 2015 were included. There were 88 cases, who comprised the study population. Radiographs were available of all. Injury, patient, and treatment characteristics were reviewed from hospital databases. Results: There was an increasing trend of surgical fixation of humeral shaft fractures during the 15 years' study period (beta = 1.266, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.36, p = 0.035). However, we found no patient or fracture-related reasons that could have explained the increasing trend of surgical care. Comminuted fracture increased the risk of operative treatment 8-fold (Odds Ratio, OR 7.82, 95% CI 1.69 to 36.3, p = 0.009). Higher age, greater angular deformity or greater diameter of the humerus were not associated with the increased operation risk. Conclusions: The treatment philosophy concerning pediatric humeral shaft fractures has presented a shift from conservative care to surgical fixation. To authors' understanding there is not evidence supporting the increasing rate of osteosynthesis.

Sufficiently stable constructs may be difficult to obtain with ankle fractures in patients with severe osteopenic bone. Augmentation of the osteosynthesis with a new synthetic bone void filler may help to solve this problem, and it can improve the clinical outcome. Materials and methods. A prospective, open-label study was performed in two surgical clinics in Norway. In 37 of 42 selected patients with Weber type B ankle fractures showing clinical and radiologic signs of osteopenic bone, at least one screw was found to be stripping during open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). All the stripped screws were augmented with the bone void filler, and tightness was assessed clinically afterwards. All patients were followed up for 2 years. Successful healing of the fracture after 3 months and absence of radiographic movement of the augmented screws were assessed relative to the plate and the bone. Safety was assessed by recording adverse events and abnormal haematology findings. Results. All 86 augmented screws were clinically tight after augmentation. After 3 months, all fractures healed, and 1 augmented and 1 non-augmented screw appeared to be radiographically loose. After 2 and 6 months, respectively, deep wound infections occurred in 2 patients (5%), necessitating antibiotic treatment, revision surgery and implant removal. After 2 years, all patients had resumed their normal daily activities, and none of the augmented screws showed signs of loosening. Conclusions. Augmentation of bone screws with this new synthetic bone void filler was an effective means of gaining screw anchorage. Screw stabilisation with the new synthetic bone void filler proved to be safe and effective in the ORIF of ankle fractures in patients with osteopenic bone.

Material/Methods: Operative surgeries performed between January 2016 and July 2018 were included in the analysis. The surgical internal fixation implants were chosen according to surgeon preference and the choice of patients between the BCFS and CLP. Functional outcomes, fracture union, complications, pain, and patient satisfaction post-operation were assessed at a follow-up of 12 to 24 months. Results: Two hundred and seventeen (217) patients, aged 21-79 years, were operated, 87 using BCFS and 130 using CLP. The operation time of the BCFS group was significantly less than the CLP group (P<0.01). We also found that BCFS group had higher degree of satisfaction (100% vs. 97%, P<0.03) and less VAS scale (0.25 +/- 0.18 vs. 0.35 +/- 0.21, P<0.001) compared with the CLP group, but the significance could only be obtained during the follow-up at 3 months after surgery. No significant differences were observed between the 2 groups when compared for fracture unions, functional scores, or complications. Conclusions: BCFS significantly reduced the operation time when compared with CLP. No significant differences were ob- served for functional outcomes, including fracture union and complications, and there was less pain and higher patient satisfaction. Both methods appeared to be safe in terms of complications. However, the effectiveness and safety of BCFS in treating comminuted multi-fragmentary mid-shaft clavicle fractures (AO/OTA 15-2C classification) need further confirmation.

This study compared the biomechanical properties of a cannulated screw tension band construct using a metal wire tension band vs. a suture tension band, considering that the suture construct could allow for decreased hardware burden in the clinical setting. Methods: A meso-type os acromiale was created in 16 cadaveric shoulders. Two cannulated 4-mm screws were placed in each specimen. Tension band augmentation was accomplished with a 1-mm stainless steel wire (wire group) or a #5 braided polyethylene suture (suture group), with 8 specimens in each group. An inferiorly directed force was applied to the anterior acromion at 1 mm/s on a materials testing machine. Stiffness and ultimate failure load were recorded and analyzed. Results: No significant difference (P = .22) was observed in the ultimate failure load between the wire (228 +/- 85 N; range, 114-397 N) and the suture (275 +/- 139 N; range, 112-530 N). No significant difference (P =.17) was observed in the stiffness between the wire (28 +/- 12 N/mm; range, 18-53 N/mm) and the suture (38 +/- 25 N/mm; range, 10-83 N/mm). Conclusions: Stainless steel wire and polyethylene suture have similar biomechanical strength in the cannulated screw tension band fixation of meso-type os acromiale at time zero.
