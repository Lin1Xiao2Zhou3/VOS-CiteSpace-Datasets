A national survey of Italian AO members	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Distal humerus fractures; Coronal shear fractures; AO Trauma Italy survey	DISTAL HUMERUS; OPEN REDUCTION; INTERNAL-FIXATION; ARTICULAR FRACTURES; PLANE FRACTURES; CAPITELLAR; ELBOW; MANAGEMENT	Introduction: Coronal shear fractures of the distal humerus are uncommon injuries representing 6% of distal humeral fractures. There is no univocal consensus about the correct management of this type of fracture. A national survey was conducted to gain more insight into the current classification, diagnosis and treatment of coronal shear fractures in Italy. Materials and methods: A postal survey was sent to all AO Italian members including residency orthopaedic surgeons. The survey consisted of general questions about personal experience in the management of these fractures: types of classification systems used, surgical approaches, treatment options and rehabilitation programs. Results: 114 orthopaedic surgeons answered a 13-items questionnaire. The most used classification system was AO/OTA (72,8%). Independent screws and if necessary plates were the most answered regarding surgical treatment (81,6%). The most encountered post-surgical complication was stiffening of the elbow (81,6%). Conclusion: An algorithm of treatment has been proposed. To better classify coronal shear fractures, the authors recommended the integration of two classification systems: AO and Dubberley classifications. In the case of posterior wall comminution, a Kocher extensile approach is recommended, otherwise, if a posterior wall is intact, Kocher or Kaplan approach can be used. The posterior transolecranic approach can be reserved to Dubberley type III or AO 13B3.3. The best treatment choice is represented by independent screws and plates placed according to fracture patterns while arthroplasty is indicated when a stable ORIF is not possible. Mobilization is postponed for about 2 weeks. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bartonícek, J; Tucek, M; Klika, D				Bartonicek, Jan; Tucek, Michal; Klika, Daniel			Inferior glenoid fossa fractures: patho-anatomy and results of operative treatment	INTERNATIONAL ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Scapular fractures; Glenoid fossa fractures; Inferior glenoid; Operative treatment	SCAPULAR FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; INTRAARTICULAR FRACTURES; CLASSIFICATION; OUTCOMES; IV	Introduction A typical feature of inferior glenoid fractures is a distal fragment separated from the glenoid fossa. In most cases, the inferior glenoid fractures are associated with a fracture of the scapular body. However, there are no detailed studies of inferior glenoid fractures, and only brief mentions can be found in the literature in this respect. Material and methods The basic group comprised 42 patients, with the mean age of 48 years, who sustained 42 fractures of the inferior glenoid. In this group, the scapular fracture anatomy was evaluated, based on 3D CT reconstructions. A total of 29 patients operated on were followed up for 12 to 128 months after injury (average, 52 months), three patients were lost to follow up. The results of the operative treatment, including complications, were assessed radiologically and functionally. Results Fracture anatomy was described from various aspects, i.e., the size of the articular surface carried by the separated glenoid fragment, the existence of multiple articular fragments, the size of the separated glenoid fragment and the extent of injury to the scapular body. All 29 operatively treated fractures radiologically healed within three months. Full and pain-free range of motion was restored in 18 patients; in eight patients it was limited by 20 degrees and in three patients by more than 40 degrees. The mean Constant score was 82. Conclusion Fractures of the inferior glenoid fossa requires CT examination, including 3D CT reconstruction with subtraction of the surrounding bones. Displaced fractures are indicated for operative treatment.

Herein, a series of isoreticular MOFs [Zn(Trz)(R-BDC)(1/2)] (FJU-40-R, R=H, NH2, Br, or OH) are synthesized. Among them, FJU-40-NH2 exhibits the highest robustness, and good heat and water resistance, attributed to its intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions. A CO2/N-2 (15: 85, v/v) mixture can be separated efficiently through a column packed bed of FJU-40-NH2 solid. The structures of CO2-loaded FJU-40-NH2 at 1 atm under various atmosphere conditions, including pure CO2, CO2/N-2 (15: 85, v/v), and air, are observed, and it is found that: 1) the mechanism for CO2 loading into the cages depends on the CO2 partial pressure; 2) FJU40-NH2 can capture CO2 directly from air, and CO2 will have priority to occupy hydrophobic cage-I, whereas hydrophilic cage-II containing the amino group is occupied by H2O molecules; 3) the triazolate C-H groups, rather than the amino groups in past observations in dry ice, act as predominant functional sites here under low CO2 partial pressure.

Beta (beta)-type titanium alloys with low elastic modulus made from non-toxic and non-allergenic elements are desirable to reduce stress shielding effect and enhance bone remodeling. In this work, a new beta-type Ti-23Nb-0.7Ta-2Zr-0.5N alloy with a Young's modulus of approximately 50 GPa was designed and characterized. The behavior of MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts on the new alloy, including adhesion, proliferation and differentiation, was evaluated by examining the cytoskeleton, focal adhesion formation, metabolic activity and extracellular matrix mineralization. Results indicated that the pre-osteoblast cells exhibited a similar degree of attachment and growth on Ti-23Nb-0.7Ta-2Zr-0.5N and Ti-6Al-4V. However, the novel alloy proved to be significantly more efficient in sustaining mineralized matrix deposition upon osteogenic induction of the cells than Ti-6Al-4V control. Further, the analysis of RAW 264.7 macrophages cytokine gene and protein expression indicated no significant inflammatory response. Collectively, these findings suggest that the Ti-23Nb-0.7Ta-2Zr-0.5N alloy, which has an increased mechanical biocompatibility with bone, allows a better osteogenic differentiation of osteoblast precursor cells than Ti-6Al-4V and holds great potential for future clinical prosthetic applications.

Fixed-angle plate osteosynthesis of the patella - An alternative to tension wiring?	CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS			English	Article						Biomechanical testing; Patella fracture; Fixed-angle plate; Modified anterior tension wiring; Cannulated screw	TRANSVERSE FRACTURES; OPERATIVE TREATMENT; INTERNAL-FIXATION; BIOMECHANICAL EVALUATION; PATELLOFEMORAL CONTACT; FEMORAL JOINT; BAND; COMPLICATIONS; PATELLECTOMY; QUADRICEPS	Background: The goal of this study is carry out a biomechanical evaluation of the stability of a bilateral, polyaxial, fixed-angle 2.7 mm plate system specifically designed for use on the patella. The results of this approach are then compared to the two currently most commonly used surgical techniques for patella fractures: modified anterior tension wiring with K-wires and cannulated lag screws with anterior tension wiring. Methods: A transient biomechanical analysis determining material failure points of all osteosyntheses were conducted on 21 identical left polyurethane foam patellae, which were osteotomized horizontally. Evaluated were load (N), displacement (mm) and run-time (s) as well as elastic modulus (MPa), tensile strength (MPa) and strain at failure (%). Findings: With a maximum load capacity of 2396 (SD 492) N, the fixed-angle plate proved to be significantly stronger than the cannulated lag screws with anterior tension wiring (1015 (SD 246) N) and the modified anterior tension wiring (625 (SD 84.9) N). The fixed-angle plate displayed significantly greater stiffness and lower fracture gap dehiscence than the other osteosyntheses. Additionally, osteosynthesis deformation was found to be lower for the fixed-angle plate. Interpretation: A bilateral fixed-angle plate was the most rigid and stable osteosynthesis for horizontal patella fractures with the least amount of fracture gap dehiscence. Further biomechanical trials performed under cycling loading with fresh cadaver specimen should be done to figure out if a fixed-angle plate may be an alternative in the surgical treatment of patella fractures.

These disturbances are commonly referred to as pitch problems in this industry. The complex composition of wood extractives is the reason why the nature of pitch problems is different for the various wood species. Also, there is a strong dependence on pulping, bleaching, and papermaking processes. Nowadays, the most common way of handling pitch is to use chemicals in order to fix the extractives to the fibers and thus remove them from the process with the final product. However, this causes serious problems in the final product and also increases problems when paper is recycled. Thus, fixation is not considered to be a sustainable operation for the future. Alternative methods to remove the extractives from the process water must be developed to overcome pitch disturbances and increase pulp quality. This is especially important in mills with closed water loops where the accumulation of extractives in the process waters can occur. In this paper an internal process water kidney, based on dissolved air flotation (DAF), is considered. The objective was to remove extractives from a kraft Mill process using Eucalyptus globulus as the raw material. The results show that with the dual system, polyethylene oxide and phenol formaldehyde resin (PEO/PFR), it is possible to remove 80% of the extractive compounds by DAF. Three different techniques, hemacytometry, gas chromatography and turbidity measurement, were used to evaluate the removal efficiency. The applicability of a fast measurement, such as turbidity, to optimize the DAF operation during a future mill operation was studied.

Material/Methods: A consecutive series of 197 Sanders type 2 joint depression calcaneal fractures was used. The segment and split functions were used to create each calcaneal fragment using Mimics Research 20.0 software. The fracture fragments were reduced in 3-matic Research 12.0 software. In the E-3D Medical 18.01 software, after superimposing the fractured calcaneus entity with the calcaneus template, we drew the fracture line on the template. Finally, the heatmap was obtained by fracture statistical analysis function. Simultaneously, the distribution of the fracture lines in the anterior part of the calcaneus (APC) and middle talar joint was recorded. Results: There were 109 cases of Sanders type 2A, 46 cases of Sanders type 2B, and 42 cases of Sanders type 2C. Based on the data, we drew the characteristic fracture map of type 2A 2B and 2C. This study found that the most common types of Sanders type 2A in APC and middle talar articular surface are type AC and type AD. In Sanders type 2B, the most common type is type AC, and in Sanders type 2C it is type ACD. Conclusions: The findings from this study showed that 3D CT imaging and reconstruction of the calcaneus was a useful diagnostic method to evaluate and classify joint depression calcaneal fractures. The calcaneal fracture map can be used to guide surgical planning and optimize the design of internal fixation.

Materials and methods A total of 120 cases were included, who underwent anteroposterior shoulder radiographs. From these, 30 cases with 3D shoulder computed tomography scans were randomly selected to print 3D model. The lateral angle between the lateral cortex of the humeral shaft and lateral border of the greater tuberosity (GT), neck-shaft angle, and height from the most proximal point of the GT to the angular point were measured. When the plates were applied on the 3D models, the gap from the most proximal point of the GT to the proximal rim of the plate was measured. Results The mean lateral angle in plain radiographs was 12.9 +/- 2.2 degrees and height from the most proximal point of the GT to the angular point was 44.4 +/- 4.7 mm. The bending angles of the three plates were 8 degrees and 10 degrees. Height from the proximal rim of the plate to the bending point was 42.4, 42.0 and 43.8 mm. In 98% of cases, the lateral angle of the humerus was larger than all three plates. In 43% of cases, height of the GT was smaller than height of plates. When plates were applied to the 3D model, the mean gap from GT to plate was 4.8 +/- 2.8 mm. Conclusions There was large variation in the lateral angle of the proximal humerus, which was not correlated with the neck-shaft angle. The lateral angle of the humerus was larger than the plates and prone to varus reduction and medial collapse.

The increasing role of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty in the treatment of proximal humerus fractures	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Proximal humerus fracture; Hemiarthroplasty; Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty	DISPLACED FRACTURES; FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES; HEMIARTHROPLASTY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MULTICENTER; PROSTHESIS; MANAGEMENT; TRENDS	Introduction: Hemiarthroplasty of the shoulder is a well established treatment for proximal humerus fractures not amenable to open reduction internal fixation. However, orthopedic surgeons have recently increased utilization of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) in the treatment of these injuries. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of hemiarthroplasty and RTSA between 2009 and 2016 for the treatment of proximal humerus fractures within a large United States integrated healthcare system. Materials and methods: A descriptive study was conducted using our integrated healthcare system's Shoulder Arthroplasty Registry. Shoulder arthroplasty cases performed for an acute proximal humerus fracture between the years of 2009 and 2016 were identified. Revision rates were determined, as well as changes in age and gender distribution of the cohort during the study period. Results: In 2015, RTSA utilization surpassed that of hemiarthroplasty for the first time in the healthcare system. The utilization of RTSA in the treatment of proximal humerus fractures increased from 4.5% of all arthroplasties in 2009 to 67.4% of arthroplasties in 2016. During the study period, patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty were younger and less likely to be female. Crude revision rate was 4.0% for hemiarthroplasty and 3.2% for RTSA. Conclusions: RTSA is increasingly being utilized for the treatment of proximal humerus fractures and now appears to be the treatment of choice. While hemiarthroplasty appears to be falling out of favor in the treatment of fractures of the shoulder, surgeons may still be preferentially using the procedure in younger patients.

These fractures may be managed operatively if substantially displaced. However, several fractures of glenoid fossa are managed nonoperatively, even if displaced, due to high incidence of associated injuries which may render patient unfi t to undergo major orthopaedic surgery. There is a relative paucity of articles reporting on outcome of treatment of glenoid fossa fractures. We present our experience of treating these injuries over past decade with operative and nonoperative methods. Materials and Methods: 21 patients of glenoid fossa fractures were included in this series with 14 males and 7 females. Patients with displacement of >5 mm who were fi t to undergo surgery within 3 weeks of injury were operated using a posterior Judet's approach. Overall 8 patients with displaced fractures were operated (Group A) while 9 patients with displaced fractures (Group B) and 4 patients with undisplaced fractures (Group C) were managed nonoperatively. Results: The mean age and followup period in this series was 29 years and 7.3 years respectively. In group A, average constant score was 87.25. The least constant score was observed for group B (58.55) while group C had an average constant score of 86. Brachial plexus injury and fracture-dislocations had poorer outcome. Conclusion: Operative treatment for displaced glenoid fractures is a viable option at centers equipped to handle critically ill patients and subset of patients with fracture-dislocation as opposed to fracture alone should always be treated operatively due to persistent loss of function.

Femur malunion treated with open osteotomy and intramedullary nailing in developing countries	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Diaphyseal malunion of the femur; Open intramedullary nailing; Femoral osteotomy		Introduction: In developing countries, malunion, after diaphyseal femur fractures initially untreated by internal fixation, is not rare. Their difficult management contrasts with the deficiency of the technical operating room facilities. Patients and methods: Our prospective study, conducted over a 1-year period, reports 16 open osteotomies fixed using Kuntscher intramedullary nailing in patients who presented malunion of the femoral diaphysis. Twelve males and four females (mean age, 34.5 years; range, 18-67 years) were managed with a mean time to surgery of 8 months (range, 4-14 months). All had initially consulted a bonesetter. The mean length inequality was 3 cm (range, 2-6 cm); the mean knee flexion limitation was 90 degrees (range, 10 degrees-120 degrees). Locking of the rotation was obtained by the obliquity of the osteotomy line. No bone filling was added but reaming and decortications were systematic. The patients were clinically and radiographically assessed at D21, D45, D90, and D120, based on the evaluation of the length inequality, mobility, and bone union. Rotational malunion or deformity were not analyzed. Results: Fifteen patients had achieved union in 90 days. In one case, secondary incurvation of the nail led to changing the nail, allowing union with no axis deformity at D120. The mean postoperative knee flexion was 120 degrees (range, 45 degrees-130 degrees). The mean gain in length was 2 cm (range, 1.5-4 cm). Discussion: This open technique using non-interlocking material allowed us to obtain bone union while improving joint mobility and length inequality. Level of evidence: Level IV. Retrospective study.

This is a rare condition and the studies supporting the procedure have small number of cases. The objective of the present study is to report a case series of six patients who underwent talar reconstructions. Materials and Methods: Six patients with talar malunions or nonunions who underwent surgical treatment were reviewed in this retrospective study. There were three nonunions and two malunions of the talar body and one malunion of the talar neck. Clinical evaluation included all the parameters used in the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot scale. Arthritic degeneration of the ankle joint was assessed according to a modified Bargon scale. Results: The mean followup was 86 months (range 24-282 months). There were no cases of postoperative avascular necrosis of the talus. Four of the six patients in our series required a subtalar fusion as part of the reconstruction procedure. The average preoperative AOFAS hindfoot score was 34, and at the time of the last evaluation, it was 74. The mean preoperative score on the modified Bargon scale for the tibiotalar joint was 1.17. At the last followup, it rose to 1.33. Three different deformities of the talus were identified (a) flattening of the talus (b) extra-articular step and (c) intraarticular step. Conclusion: Reconstruction of talar nonunions and malunions improved function in selected patients with a low risk of complications. Three different anatomical patterns of talar nonunions and malunions were identified.

Benign aggressive lesions of femoral head and neck: Is salvage possible	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Benign aggressive lesion; femoral neck; treatment	PROXIMAL FEMUR; BONE-TUMORS	Background: Benign aggressive bone lesions of the femoral head and neck are mostly seen in young adults and warrant treatment for pain, impending fracture or established fracture, and disease clearance. It becomes challenging to treat them effectively while attempting salvage of the femoral head and yet achieving long term disease control with minimum complications. We describe our technique and experience in dealing with these lesions which can achieve the above-mentioned goals and can be easily replicated. Materials and Methods: We analyzed 15 cases of surgically treated, biopsy-proven benign, locally aggressive lesions affecting the femoral head and neck in skeletally mature individuals. All cases were treated with extended curettage through anterolateral modified SmithuPetersen approach along with tricortical iliac crest bone graft (combined with fibular graft in some cases) reconstruction with or without suitable internal fixation. Results: All, except one, patients were available for follow up. The age ranged from 18 to 43 years and the follow up ranged between 24 and 124 months (average 78 months). These included aneurysmal bone cysts (9), giant cell tumors (4), and fibrous dysplasia (2). The indication was pain (8), with impending (2) or established pathological neck femur fracture (5). In all cases, there was satisfactory healing of lesion and timely rehabilitation. Nonunion, avascular necrosis or local recurrences were not seen. The MSTS functional score was good or excellent in all (range 26u29, average 28). Conclusion: Benign aggressive lesions affecting femoral head and neck in young and middle-aged adults pose a treatment challenge. A sturdy, lasting reconstruct with acceptable functional outcome and minimal recurrence rate can be achieved by salvaging the femoral head and neck using curettage and reconstruction, obviating the need for replacement at such an early age.

The understanding of their corrosive mechanism in physiological environments is therefore essential for making application-orientated designs. Thus, this in vitro study was designed to assess the effects of CO2 on corrosive behavior of AZ31D to mimic in vivo special ingredient. Electrochemical technologies accompanied with Scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, Energy dispersive spectroscopy and hydrogen evolution measurement were employed to analyze corrosive rates and mechanisms of AZ31D. Moreover, the biocompatibility of AZ31D was assessed with a direct cell attachment assay and an indirect cytotoxicity test in different diluted extracts. The ion concentrations in extracts were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to offer explanations on the differences of cell viability in the indirect test. The results of the direct cytotoxicity assay showed that the corrosive rate of AZ31D was too rapid to allow for cell adhesion. Extracts diluted less than 20 times would cause adverse effects on cell proliferation, likely due to excessive ions and gas release. Moreover, the presence of CO2 did not cause significant differences on corrosive behavior of AZ31D according to the results of electrochemical testing and hydrogen evolution measurement. This might be caused by the simultaneous process of precipitation and dissolution of MgCO3 due to the penetration role of CO2. This analysis of corrosive atmospheres on the degradation behavior of magnesium alloys would contribute to the design of more scientific in vitro testing systems in the future. (C) 2013 The Authors.

However, such studies on complications are limited, and quantitative evidence is still lacking. To evaluate the clinical value of cervical discometry combined with adjacent intraoperative intradiscal pressure in cervical vertebral surgery through clinical explorations. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, 100 patients who were treated with anterior decompression, reconstruction, and internal fixation, were enrolled. Among them, 50 patients received ACDF combined with perioperative pressure adjustment of the adjacent segments to ensure that the pressure difference was less than 5 mmHg. The other 50 patients who had only simple ACDF were considered as the control group. Patient information, radiographic changes, axial symptoms (AS), and the occurrence of ASD were recorded in the study. Results: The degree of lordosis (D values) at postoperative of all cases were positive. The D value of the two groups of patients immediately after the operation and at the last follow-up were significantly higher than that before the operation (P < 0.05). The incidence of AS was significantly lower in the experimental group than that in the control group (P < 0.05). Besides, there were only 10 patients in the experimental group during the five-year follow-up period, which was significantly lower than the 19 patients in the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The intraoperative intervertebral disc pressure measurement could effectively monitor the vertebral body distraction strength and reduce the incidence of postoperative AS and ASD.

Material & Methods: The study sample involved 45 upper extremities from human adult cadavers. Two different plates (HOFER; PHILOS) were applied to the proximal humerus. Each hole was drilled until the respective participant thought to have placed the drill bit subchondral. Next, penetration of the far cortex was conducted to determine the residual bone stock. Additionally, the point of screw penetration of the far cortex was identified for each hole of the plates and allocated to five regions with different bone mineral density as described by Tingart et al. Results: The screw penetration rate and the residual bone stock were compared within the 5 BMD regions. A significantly thicker residual bone stock was found at the central region (SD +/- 13.1 mm) than in the anterior region (SD +/- 9.5 mm) and in the posterior region (SD +/- 8.5 mm). The anterior region revealed a significantly higher penetration rate than the posterior region (p = 0.01) and the central region (p = 0.03). Conclusion: The anterior region of the humeral head was associated with a higher over penetration rate of the far cortex into the glenohumeral joint and a decreased bone stock after subchondral drilling representing a reduced bone mineral density (BMD).

As a perfect classification should have high intra- and interobserver agreement, this study aims to access reliability of three classification systems: Garden, AO and simple II stage classification. Materials and methods: Four orthopaedic trauma surgeons (two of them professors) and two senior orthopaedic trauma residents were invited to evaluated 136 blinded anterior-posterior and lateral X-rays of patients with femoral neck fractures. Observers classified fractures according to IV stage Garden, AO and simple II stage classifications. The exercise was repeated after one month on same but randomised X-rays. Cohen kappa was used to measure inter- and intraobserver agreement. Fleiss kappa was used to access multi-rater agreement. Results: AO classification showed an overall agreement of 0.22 (fair agreement). Garden classification had overall reliability slightly higher than AO, but matching same fair agreement group (0.33). II stage classification provided the highest estimates: from 0.35 (fair agreement) to 0.83 (almost perfect agreement) and multi-rater agreement of 0.50 (moderate agreement). There was seen no difference in intra- and interobserver agreement between observer groups (professors, trauma surgeons and trauma residents) Discussion: All three classification systems showed equal adoption among differently experienced observer groups. Despite this finding, IV stage Garden and AO classifications should be avoided in clinical use because of poor reproducibility. Only simple II stage classification showed sufficient intra- and interobserver reliability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Mechanical performance in axial compression of a titanium polyaxial locking plate system in a fracture gap model	VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ORTHOPAEDICS AND TRAUMATOLOGY			English	Article						VetLOX; polyaxial; locking plate; Delrin rods; screw angulation	SINGLE-CYCLE; INTERNAL FIXATORS; TIBIAL FRACTURES; SOP IMPLANT; 3 STANDARD; BIOMECHANICS; CONSTRUCTS; STIFFNESS; FIXATION; STRENGTH	Objective: To evaluate the bending strength of the VetLO (R) polyaxial locking plate system. Materials and methods: Thirty-five 3.5 mm 12-hole titanium VetLOX (R) plates were used to stabilize seven different construct designs in a 1 cm fracture gap simulation model. Each construct was subjected to axial compression. Mean bending stiffness (BS) and yield load (YL) of each construct design were analysed using a one-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc analysis. Screw angulation was measured on reconstructed computed tomography (CT) images. Results: Reducing plate working length for fixed-angle constructs significantly increased BS (p <0.01) and YL (p <0.01). For a constant plate working length, increasing screw number did not significantly affect BS (p = 1.0) or YL (p = 0.86). Screw angulation measurement technique was validated by intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) (ICC >0.9 for inter- and intra-observer measurements). An average screw angle of 13.2 degrees did not significantly affect mechanical performance although incomplete screw head-plate engagement was noted on some reconstructed CT images when angulation exceeded 10. Prefabricated screw-head inserts did not significantly increase mechanical performance. A 4 mm bone-plate stand-off distance significantly reduced BS and YL by 63% and 69% respectively. Clinical relevance: The VetLOX (R) system allows the benefits of polyaxial screw insertion whilst maintaining comparable bending properties to fixed angle insertion. The authors recommend accurate plate contouring to reduce the risk of plate bending.	[Tomlinson, A. W.; Comerford, E.

Materials and Methods: Five Ni-Cr and 10 titanium disks with a diameter of 5 mm and thickness of 3 mm were prepared. DLC coating was applied to five titanium disks. Electrode samples were prepared, and open circuit potential measurements, galvanic current measurements over platinum electrodes, and potentiodynamic polarization tests were carried out. For the SEM evaluation, 20 Ni-Cr alloy and 10 gold alloy superstructures were cast and prepared over 30 abutments. DLC coating was applied to 10 of the abutments. Following the fixation of prosthetic assemblies, the samples were embedded in acrylic resin and cross sectioned longitudinally. Internal fit evaluations were carried out through examination of the SEM images. Results: Titanium showed more noble and electrochemically stable properties than Ni-Cr alloy. DLC coating over the cathode electrode served as an insulating film layer over the surface and prevented galvanic coupling. Results of the SEM evaluations indicated that the DLC-coated and titanium abutments showed no statistically significant difference in fit. Hence, no adverse effects on the adaptation of prosthetic components were found with the application of DLC coating over abutment surfaces. Conclusions: DLC coating might serve as a galvanic corrosion barrier between titanium abutments and Ni-Cr superstructures.

Grammont reversed prosthesis for acute complex fracture of the proximal humerus in an elderly population with 5 to 12 years follow-up	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Shoulder; Reverse prosthesis; Acute fracture	RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATION; SHOULDER REPLACEMENT; ARTHROPLASTY; HEMIARTHROPLASTY; REASONS	Purpose of the study: The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze outcome in 23 cases of Delta III reverse ball-and-socket total shoulder prosthesis implantation for acute complex fractures of the proximal humerus in an elderly population with poor bone quality. In this type of population, this procedure could respond to the difficulties of a reliable and efficient re-fixation of the tubercles. Material and methods: From 1993 to 2000, 23 Delta III prostheses were implanted by a single operator for acute injury: 18 three-part and four-part fractures and five fracture-dislocations. The study population included two men and 21 women, mean age 75 years, ten on the dominant side. Surgery was performed under general anesthesia in the semi-sitting position via the anterolateral approach without osteotomy of the acromion, with 10-20 degrees retroversion of the humeral stem (except in one shoulder) and cement fixation in two. For five shoulders, the tubercles were re-fixed. Postoperative physiotherapy was not possible in all patients. Outcome was assessed with the Constant score and with AP and lateral Lamy radiographs. Results: Seven patients died so the series included 16 cases for analysis. Complications were: reflex sympathetic dystrophy (n = 2), postoperative Acinetobacter infection (n = 1) requiring revision to clean and drain allowing preservation of the prosthesis, and early postoperative anterior dislocation (n = 1) (10 degrees stem anteversion) with surgical revision to re-orient the stem. At a mean follow-up of 86 months, the Constant score was 60 points (contralateral shoulder, 83 points). Outcome, influenced in cases of refixation of the tubercles, was good for pain (14.1), activity (13.3), strength (16.1), anterior elevation (6.5), and abduction (6.5), but very poor for external (1.1) and internal (2.4) rotation. The radiographs showed aseptic glenoid loosening (n = 1) at 12 years with surgical revision in 2005; the Constant score at 6 months follow-up was 48 points, inferior scapular notching (n = 11) according the Nerot classification (six stage 1, four stage 2, one stage 3, at 2, 4.3, and 5 years follow-up), inferior spurs (n = 9) appearing at a mean 2.5 years follow-up (stable after emergence without clinical impact), proximal humeral resorption (n = 4) (medially for three at a mean 8 years follow-up and one laterally at 10 years), and a humeral radiolucent line (n = 1) at 5 years follow-up. Discussion: For acute complex fractures of the proximal humerus in elderly subjects with poor bone quality, when effective and reliable re-fixation of the tubercles is difficult or impossible, the reverse ball-and-socket shoulder prosthesis is a possible alternative providing good functional outcome except for rotations, but with the risk of inferior scapular notching. Although not problematic in the medium term, these notches may contribute to glenoid loosening with bone loss in the long term. Nevertheless, this procedure seems to improve the status of patients with such fractures. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Methods: This prospective study included patients with fresh mono-thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures. Patients enrolled were randomly divided into three groups. The patients in group A underwent stentoplasty with calcium sulfate/calcium phosphate (CSCP) composite filler and patients in group B with hydroxyapatite/collagen (HAP/COL) composite filler, while patients in group C underwent BKP with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). The clinical outcome was evaluated with visual analogue pain scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability score (ODI). The radiological results were evaluated with anterior height (AH) and Cobb angle of vertebral body. Computed tomography (CT) was used to assess osteogenesis effect. Results: Each group included 14 patients. The VAS, ODI, Cobb angle and AH were statistically improved compared with preoperative and there was no significant difference between the three groups. However, the AH in group A and group B at 1-year follow-up presented slight loss compared with 1 day after surgery. CT results suggested both group A and group B presented obvious bone trabecula formation and variations of CT value. Conclusion: The stentoplasty with resorbable calcium salt bone void fillers demonstrated clinical outcomes similar to traditional BKP for vertebral compression fractures. Both HAP/ COL and CSCP performed certain osteogenesis. However, stentoplasty with studied fillers showed slight loss of AH within 1 year after surgery.

There is a paucity of literature on outcomes of parallel reconstruction plates using olecranon osteotomy technique along with large sample size. This study focuses primarily on rate of various complications encountered in intraarticular AO Type C distal humerus fractures. Materials and Methods: In this prospective study, we included 94 patients with isolated closed intraarticular AO type C distal and humerus injuries. Exclusion criteria were polytrauma, open injuries, and pathological fractures (except osteoporosis). The followup was done immediate postoperatively, 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year and at 2 years. Range of motion (ROM), Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS), and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score was recorded at each visit. Assessment of union was done based on X-ray. Patients were classified into two groups; Group 1 u patients without complications (n = 64) and Group 2 u with one or more complications. Results: The average duration of surgery was 2 h and 15 min. The complication rate was 31.9% (30/94), however, a total of 45 complications were noted. The difference between ROM in the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05), however, the difference between MEPS and DASH score was not statistically significant. The most common complication found was ulnar nerve neuropathy. Conclusion: Parallel plating using olecranon osteotomy is an acceptable approach for this fracture, but due to inherent nature of this injury, it has its own set of complications which must be counseled before surgery and active participation of patient is required to obtain realistic expectations and goals for the future.

Study of the mechanical reliability of an S-shaped adjustable osteosynthesis plate for bilateral sagittal split osteotomies. Study on 15 consecutive cases	JOURNAL OF STOMATOLOGY ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article						Bilateral sagittal split osteotomy; Osteosynthesis plate	RIGID INTERNAL-FIXATION; 2-YEAR FOLLOW-UP; MANDIBULAR ADVANCEMENT; ORTHOGNATHIC SURGERY; WIRE OSTEOSYNTHESIS; SKELETAL STABILITY; STABILIZATION; MULTICENTER; MAXILLARY; TERM	Introduction: The main challenge during the osteosynthesis of a bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) is to take into account the correct position of the condyle. Adjustable plates can be used to fine-tune the final occlusion without changing the osteosynthesis. A new type of adjustable plate is presented in this article. The aim is to assess the mechanical reliability of this system during the surgery and during the healing period, thanks to a preliminary prospective on 15 consecutive cases. Material and methods: The bridge of the plate studied here has an "S''-shape and can be bent in two different planes. Fifteen patients presenting a maxilla-mandibular disharmony have been operated on with this device. Clinical results were evaluated three months postoperatively and the mechanical reliability of the device was studied prospectively from teleradiographies of 15 patients operated on in our department. Results: This study shows good results, with respect to the mechanical reliability of this S-shaped adjustable plate, three months postoperatively corresponding to the bone-healing period. Radiographic observations did not show any significant displacement at the osteosynthesis site. Discussion: This preliminary study shows the mechanical reliability of this new S-shaped adjustable plate. Its semi-rigid character may allow for certain condyle position adaptability. No plate fracture was reported for this 15 patient series. These encouraging results have to be confirmed on a larger series. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an applied training course, including cadaveric dissection, for the surgical treatment of acetabular fractures. Material/Methods: This retrospective study included 35 patients who underwent surgical treatment for acetabulum fractures between 2012-2016. Patients were divided into three groups during two training courses, for the first two years and second two years. The surgical treatment was performed through single or combined standard approaches, according to the fracture pattern. The radiological outcome was evaluated using Matta's criteria to grade postoperative reduction and final radiological outcome and the restoration of the hip joint center (HJC). The clinical outcome was evaluated using the modified the Merle d'Aubigne-Postel (DAP) hip score. Results: Both post-course groups had statistically better functional and radiological outcomes compared with the precourse group. Depending on the learning curve, the mean duration of surgery decreased from 153 minutes to 82.3 minutes. Although there was no statistical difference between groups in the vertical shift of the HJC, there was a statistically significant in the amount of horizontal shift of the HJC in the second two years of training, compared with the other groups. Conclusions: Functional and radiological outcome of surgical treatment of acetabular fracture may be improved with increased training, depending on the learning curve.

The long-term scintigraphic findings of pasteurized bone grafts in relation to clinical patients' data were reviewed retrospectively. Twenty-two sarcoma patients (mean age, 24 years) done between April 2000 and January 2004 constituted the material of this study. One hundred and fifty-two 99 m TC-methylene diphosphonate (MDP) whole-body scans were reviewed. Initially, all autografts appeared as photon deficient areas. Diffusely increased bone uptake was present at the osteotomy sites within 4-6 months after surgery, the uptake of the grafted pasteurized bone was detected in 17 patients from about 6 months after surgery. Of 22 patients, 11 (50%) showed higher uptake than the normal bone, 6 (27%) had uptake similar to the normal bone, while 5 (23%) had less uptake than the normal bone. Radiologically, 15 patients (68%) showed complete incorporation of graft and 5 patients (23%) had partial incorporation. Oncologically, 16 patients are disease free, while 6 died of disease. No local recurrence was detected at a mean of 59 months, while fracture (13.6%) eventually healed with bone grafting and revision of internal fixation, graft collapse (9%) (needed revision arthroplasty) and infection (9%), one cured and one converted to rotationplasty, were the major complications encountered. Significantly more mechanical complications were seen when tracer uptake suggestive of revascularization occurred; thus, revascularization and partial bone ingrowth are not sufficient conditions for lower mechanical complication rate. The method of pasteurization of bone is a useful option for reconstruction after resection of malignant bone tumors.

Hip Fracture Trends in America Between 2009 and 2016	GERIATRIC ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY & REHABILITATION			English	Article						hip fractures; outcomes; demographics; procedures; diagnoses	CIGARETTE-SMOKING; EXCESS MORTALITY; RISK; OSTEOPOROSIS; IMPACT; OUTCOMES; WOMEN; METAANALYSIS; MORBIDITY; HEALTH	Background: Hip fractures are a common condition associated with high morbidity and mortality. In this study, we assess (1) yearly incidences, (2) demographic factors, (3) postoperative outcomes, (4) primary diagnoses, and (5) primary procedures. Materials and Methods: The National Inpatient Sample was queried for patients admitted with hip fractures from 2009 to 2016 (n = 2 761 850). Variables analyzed were age, sex, race, obesity status, Charlson Comorbidity Index, smoking status, osteoporosis status, lengths of stay (LOS), discharge dispositions, charges, costs, mortalities, inpatient complications, primary and secondary diagnoses, and primary procedures. Results: From 2009 to 2016, the overall gross number of hip fractures decreased (P < .001). At the conclusion of the study, more patients were male, obese, and smokers, while fewer had a diagnosis of osteoporosis (P < .001 for all). Mean LOS significantly decreased (P < .001), while charges and costs increased (P < .001 for both). Both mortality and the overall complication rate decreased (P < .001 for both). Specifically, complications that decreased included myocardial infarctions, deep vein thromboses, pulmonary emboli, pneumoniae, hematomas/seromas, urinary tract infections, and transfusions (P < .001 for all). Complications that increased included cardiac arrests, respiratory failures, mechanical complications, and sepsis (P < .001 for all). The most common diagnosis was "closed fracture of intertrochanteric section of neck of femur." The procedure performed most often was "open reduction of fracture with internal fixation, femur." Conclusion: An increasing number of males and smokers have sustained hip fractures, although fewer patients with osteoporosis experienced these injuries. A decreasing overall complication rate may indicate improving perioperative courses for hip fracture patients. However, several shortcomings still exist and can be improved to further decrease negative outcomes.

In this study, we analyzed the healing status of articular cartilage using second-look arthroscopy with clinical and radiological results from patient's in schatzker Type I, II, and III tibial plateau fracture. Materials and Methods: 43 patients operated between January 2011 and December 2013 were included in this retrospective study. Radiological evaluation was performed by comparing simple radiographs from the preoperative, postoperative, and final followup period. Clinical evaluations were performed using the Knee Society Knee Score (KSKS) and the Knee Society Functional Score (KSFS). Moreover, second-look arthroscopic evaluation was performed during implant removal, and cartilage healing status was classified according to the International Cartilage Repair Society grading system (ICRS). Results: In all 43 patients, bony union was achieved with a mean duration of 13.7 weeks. The degree of cartilage healing was poor when the step-off was high (P = 0.016). Furthermore, even in cases with satisfactory step-off <2 mm, there was no case with complete cartilage healing. Between ICRS grade and clinical results, the respective Pearson coefficient for KSKS and KSFS were r = 0.62 and r = 0.59 indicating mean statistically significant negative correlations (P = 0.001). Conclusion: Even though step off was reduced anatomically and clinical outcome was excellent or good, there was not always complete cartilage healing in a followup on second-look arthroscopy. Therefore, we focused on not only radiologic and clinical outcome but also the actual status of cartilage with second-look arthroscopy.

The coronoid fractures of these patients were repaired using Mother-Child screw (MCS). MATERIAL AND METHODS Twelve men and six women (mean age: 47.2 years) with terrible triad injury of the elbow were followed up for a mean of 17.6 months (range: 13-42 months). Surgical treatment consisted of open reduction and internal fixation of coronoid fractures with MCS, radial head fracture with MCS (Mason type II, n = 10), or mini-plate (Mason type III, n = 3). Furthermore, all underwent lateral collateral ligament repair (n = 9, 100%), and in cases of persistent instability, medial collateral ligament repair was performed (n = 3, 33%). RESULTS At last follow-up, average arc of ulnohumeral motion was 130 (range: 65 to 150), average arc of forearm rotation was 148 (range: 100-160), mean Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score was 7.1 (range: 0-28.5), and mean Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) was 92 (range: 70-100). According to the Mayo Elbow Performance Index (MEPI), 10 patients were excellent in, seven patients were good, and one patient was fair. All patients had a stable elbow. No secondary coronoid fragment dislocation or implant failures was reported. Fracture healing was observed in all patients. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that coronoid fracture treatment with MCS may be a new, effective and easy therapeutic option in terrible triad injury.

Materials and methods: The subjects were 39 patients (78 sides) who underwent bi-maxillary surgery. They consisted of 2 groups (18 class II cases and 21 class III cases), and were selected randomly from among patients who underwent surgery between 2012 and 2016. The TMJ disc tissue and joint effusion were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the TMJ space, condylar height, ramus height, ramus inclination and condylar square were assessed by computed tomography (CT), pre-and postoperatively. Results: The number of joints with anterior disc displacement in class II was significantly higher than that in class III (p < 0.0001). However, there were no significant differences between the two classes regarding ratio of joint symptoms and ratio of joint effusion pre-and post-operatively. Class II was significantly better than class III regarding reduction ratio of condylar height (p < 0.0001) and square (p = 0.0005). Conclusion: The study findings suggest that condylar morphology could change in both class II and III after bi-maxillary surgery. The findings of the numerical analysis also demonstrated that reduction of condylar volume occurred frequently in class II, although TMJ disc position classification did not change significantly, as previously reported.

Significantly increased rates were noticed in women and older population. From the histopathological point of view, venous arterialization, smooth muscle cell hypertrophy, and hyperplasia are the main changes noticed in varicose vein disease. Some of the main therapeutic methods used in the management of varicose disease are injection sclerotherapy, conservative, surgical, saphenous vein inversion and removal, high saphenous ligation, ambulatory phlebectomy, transilluminated powered phlebectomy, endovascular management, cryostripping. Aim : The aim of this study was to evaluate the morphology of connective fibers from the wall of the varicose veins extirpated by cryostripping. Patients, Materials and Methods : The study included 109 samples taken by cryostripping method. Hematoxylin-Eosin, Masson's trichrome, Silver and Orcein staining were applied. The assessment of fibers was made according to score values between 0 and 3. Results : It was found no major structural differences in terms of alterations of collagen fibers induced by the applied surgical procedure. It was noticed duplications and multiplications of the internal elastic lamina, as diffuse and nodular forms. Depletion of elastic fibers at the media was a lesion identified in most of the specimens. The depletion of reticulin fibers correlates with the accumulation of collagen fibers, which partially or completely replace the network in the media and intima. No correlation was found between changes in the reticulin network and the time between prelevation and buffered formalin fixation, the maximum time investigated being five days. Conclusions : The Orcein staining in the venous vessel evaluation panel may be a useful investigation.

The therapeutic option remains controversial. Aims: The goal of our study was to evaluate the long-term results and to identify predictive factors of functional outcomes. Settings and Design: Retrospective monocentric study. Materials and Methods: Forty consecutive FS were included (24 nonoperated and 16 operated) from 1984 to 2009. Clinical results were assessed with Simple Shoulder Test (SST), Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), Short Form-12 (SF12), Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand score (DASH), and Constant score (CST). Plain radiographs were reviewed to evaluate secondary displacement, fracture healing, and modification of the lateral offset of the gleno-humeral joint (chest X-rays). New radiographs were made to evaluate osteoarthritis during follow-up. Statistical Analysis Used: T-test, Mann-Whitney test, and the Pearsons correlation coefficient were used. The significance level was set at 0.05. Results: At mean follow-up of 135 months (range 12-312), clinical results were satisfactory regarding different mean scores: SST 10.5 points, OSS 14 points, SANE 81%, SF12 (50 points and 60 points), DASH 14.5 points and CST 84 points. There were no significant differences between operative and non-operative groups. However, the loss of lateral offset influenced the results negatively. Osteoarthritis was diagnosed in five patients (12.5%) without correlation to fracture patterns and type of treatment. Conclusions: This study advocates that floating shoulder may be treated conservatively and surgically with satisfactory clinical long-term outcomes. However, the loss of gleno-humeral lateral offset should be evaluated carefully before taking a therapeutic option.

Distal humerus lateral condyle fracture in children: When is the conservative treatment a valid option?	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Distal humerus fracture; Humerus lateral condyle fracture; Children; Closed treatment; Humerus	SLIGHTLY DISPLACED FRACTURES; PREVENTION	Introduction: Distal humerus condyle fracture in children is rare. These fractures often mislead the emergency physician or surgeon. However, treatment adapted to the degree of displacement achieves excellent clinical and radiographic results. The objective of this study was to clarify indications for conservative treatment of lateral humeral condyle fracture in children. Materials and methods: Twenty-two children who had sustained lateral humeral condyle fracture between January 2007 and January 2010 were reviewed in April 2010. At this consultation, the children underwent clinical and radiological examination. The Hardacre functional score was used to determine objective clinical outcome. Results: Conservative treatment was exclusive to cases of lateral condyle displacement equal to or less than 1 mm. All other fractures were managed by surgical open reduction and fixation using cross-pinning. There was no statistically significant difference in clinical or radiological outcome between conservative and surgical management. Discussion: Lateral humeral condyle fracture is difficult to diagnose in children. The majority of poor results reported in literature relate to inadequate initial treatment. Given a radiological aspect of hemarthrosis of the elbow, the emergency physician prescribes multiple X-ray views of the affected elbow (anteroposterior, lateral and internal oblique). The clinical aspect of lateral humeral condyle fracture is often characteristic (ecchymosis facing the head of the radius). Nondisplaced or minimally displaced lateral humeral condyle fracture can be managed conservatively under close survey. However, secondary displacement under the cast is often difficult or impossible to detect, and outpatient surgery is therefore being increasingly indicated in our department.

This study aimed to introduce an injury mechanism-based new classification of Schatzker IV tibial plateau fractures and evaluate its reliability. Additionally, this study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of operative Schatzker IV tibial plateau fractures treated according to the surgical sequences determined by the new classification.Materials and methodsA total of 63 cases of operative Schatzker IV tibial plateau fractures that were treated following the new surgical sequences were enrolled in our study. The CT images of these patients were reviewed and classified twice according to the new 3D classification by 4 independent observers. The reliability of the classification was calculated through kappa analysis. The classification-determined surgical sequence was evaluated by observing the postoperative efficacy during the follow-up.ResultsBoth the intra-observer (the mean k = 0.897, CI 0.806-0.971) and inter-observer (the mean k = 0.883, CI 0.786-0.961) reliability of 3D-classification showed excellent agreement according to Landis and Koch. All the patients were followed up for 6-28 months (average 12.8 months). As for the evaluation of the postoperative efficacy, according to KSS, 53 cases were rated as excellent, 8 cases as good, and 2 cases as fair results.ConclusionsThe new proposed classification showed high intra-observer and inter-observer reliability in our study. The surgical sequence determined by the classification can help surgeons to acquire good reduction and rigid internal fixation. Therefore the new classification of Schatzker IV tibial plateau fractures and the derived surgical sequences are worthy of further popularization and application in clinical trials.

Materials and methods: In this ex vivo study, conducted between June 2017 and August 2017, we used five fresh sheep shoulder joints. First, the shoulder joint space was filled with saline solution. An insulated cannula was placed in the joint capsule, and a conductive wire was introduced into the joint via this cannula. A single titanium screw was inserted from the tuberculum majus into the posteroinferior quadrant of the humeral head under fluoroscopic observation. Conductivity was continuously measured using a digital multimeter. When a sudden decrease in conduction resistance was detected, fluoroscopic images were obtained in the anteroposterior (AP) and lateral directions. These images were assessed for penetration by a blinded surgeon. Penetration was confirmed by dissection of the joint. Results: There was a significant decrease in electrical resistance when screw penetration occurred (p<0.001). All penetration events were confirmed using our novel method. For all five of the specimens, either AP or lateral images could not be used to confirm penetration. For two of these specimens, penetration was undetectable in both AP and lateral fluoroscopic images, but a decrease in resistance was recorded. Conclusion: The described method exhibits greater sensitivity and accuracy for metal penetration to joint, and it is effective in detecting screws in the joints. The novel method described in this paper was applied in a prototype setting, and we believe that this concept can continue to be developed.

Capitellar erosion after radial head arthroplasty: A comparative biomechanical study of operated radial head fractures on cadaveric specimens	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Capitulum; Cartilage; Erosion; Radial head fracture; Radial head arthroplasty	LIGAMENT REPAIR; ELBOW; PROSTHESIS; EXCISION; REPLACEMENT; STABILITY; SIZE	Background: We asked whether open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) or radial head arthroplasty (RHA), common techniques used for the confrontation of displaced or comminuted radial head fractures, are correlated with cartilage wear of the capitulum. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that neither ORIF nor RHA are correlated with capitellar cartilage wear. Material and methods: On 5 cadaveric elbow specimens, osteotomies were employed to simulate radial head comminuted fractures followed with ORIF by Herbert screws. Radial heads were also excised from other 5 cadaveric elbow specimens and were replaced by metallic monopolar implants. Finally, 2 elbows were not operated and used as a control group. Custom-made rotary machines, working unstoppably, generated 700,000 pronation and supination forearm movements at a 110 degrees arc of motion. The elbow joints were examined with pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and the articular surfaces of the capitula were resected and sent for histopathology study. Results: In the 2 cadaveric elbows of the control group and the 4 elbows treated with ORIF, no cartilage damage was found. The fifth one displayed cartilage fissures, which were, classified according to International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grading system as grade I cartilage damage. On the contrary, all 5 elbows treated with RHA sustained complete cartilage loss, exposure of the subchondral bone and were classified as ICRS grade IV cartilage damage. Discussion: Our study suggests that metallic monopolar RHA after a displaced or comminuted radial head fracture carries a high risk of rapidly evolving cartilage loss of the capitulum.

Palliative surgeries such as tendon transfer and ankle arthrodesis are reserved for permanent deformity, with the arthroscopic technique had not been widely studied before. This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcome and quality of life after arthroscopic ankle fusion of paralytic foot-drop deformity.Materials and MethodsThe patients who were retrospectively enrolled in this study underwent arthroscopic ankle fusion for paralytic foot-drop deformity between March 2017 and December 2021. The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score and Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT) were the measures used for clinical assessment. To judge the union, serial plain radiographs of the ankle were obtained. The preoperative and postoperative means were analyzed utilizing a two-tailed paired t-test, with a p value of less than 0.05 indicating statistical significance.ResultsThis study included 21 consecutive patients with a mean follow-up of 35.09 +/- 4.5 months and a mean age of 41.5 +/- 6.1 years. Highly significant improvements were observed between the preoperative and final follow-up means of the AOFAS score (from 57.6 +/- 4.6 to 88.3 +/- 2.7) and CAIT (from 12.1 +/- 2.2 to 28.9 +/- 1.01; p < 0.00001 for both). All patients attained radiographic union and resumed their previous occupations without reporting serious adverse effects.ConclusionsArthroscopic ankle fusion is an effective, minimally invasive palliative surgery for patients suffering from permanent paralytic foot-drop deformity. This technique was shown to provide good functional and radiologic outcomes without significant complications.

Quantifying and visualizing <i>Nitrospirillum amazonense</i> strain CBAmC in sugarcane after using different inoculation methods	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						FISH-CLSM; Inoculant; Bioinput; qPCR; Biological nitrogen fixation; Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria	TARGETED OLIGONUCLEOTIDE PROBES; REAL-TIME PCR; AZOSPIRILLUM-BRASILENSE; NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; DIAZOTROPHIC BACTERIA; SENSITIVE DETECTION; GROWTH; VARIETIES; YIELD; SOIL	Background and AimsNitrospirillum amazonense strain CBAmC is a nitrogen-fixing bacterium that has been used for sugarcane inoculation. Despite its beneficial effects, however, little is known about the establishment and colonization of this microorganism in its inoculated host plant. Furthermore, alternative inoculation methods need to be tested in the sugarcane crop. The objective of the present work was to quantify and visualize CBAmC in sugarcane cultivar RB867515 after using three inoculation methods.MethodsUtilizing one node as propagation material, three bacterial inoculation methods were tested under greenhouse conditions. For up to 60 days after inoculation (DAI), qPCR was used to quantify the bacterial loads in the plant or substrate while FISH-CLSM was used to confirm the establishment and colonization profile of CBAmC in different plant tissues.ResultsFISH-CLSM indicated that the CBAmC strain could establish itself on different tissues of sugarcane, especially roots. qPCR revealed variable bacterial loads in the plants inoculated according to the three methods tested. In addition, little or no bacterial loads were detected in the substrate a few days after inoculation, regardless of the method used.ConclusionsN. amazonense CBAmC proves to be a bacterium that preferentially associates with the surface of the root tissues of sugarcane propagated by one node, instead of colonizing internal plant tissues or remaining in the soil. The inoculation method consisting of immersion of the mini-setts in bacterial suspension proved to be more efficient than the inoculation methods of applying the suspension onto the post-sprouting substrate or to the lowest leaf.

Fortunately, poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA), a bioabsorbable aliphatic polyester, has exhibited certain advantages in practical application due to its degradation over time in vivo with a minimal inflammatory response. However, the use of a PLLA bone screw for repairing defective bones is actually limited by the difficulty in realizing the balance between stiffness and toughness in current products. Herein, we report a novel strategy to fabricate the microbone screw from a blend of PLLA and poly[(butylene succinate)-co-adipate] (PBSA) by adopting the combination of the microinjection molding process featured with an intensive shear stress field and the subsequent annealing strategy. Accordingly, the hybrid shish-kebab structures consisting of flexible PBSA fibers attached by well-aligned lamellar crystals of PLLA could be generated, which prove to be able to overcome the difficulties well in keeping the balance between stiffness strength and toughness of the regular PLLA microparts. Thanks to the above-formed unique hybrid shish-kebab structures, the bone-mimicking PLLA/PBSA (90/10) blend material not only possesses excellent ductility (elongation at break of 51%) but also exhibits high stiffness (Young's modulus of 2.32 GPa) and balanced tensile strength (61.2 MPa). Moreover, the flexural measurements show that the fabricated PLLA/PBSA microbone screw also possesses good flexural properties (comparable flexural strength and much better toughness) compared to that of the pure PLLA bone screw. The strategy proposed in this work for fabrication of the PLLA-based microbone screw could be industrially scalable and shows good application prospects.

Three Dimensional Morphologic Analysis of the Lateral Surface of the Canine Femur	VETERINARY SURGERY			English	Article							LOCKING COMPRESSION PLATE; INTERNAL-FIXATION; FRACTURES; STABILITY; BONE; DOGS; LCP	ObjectivesAnalyze the lateral plating surface of the femur to obtain bend and twist angles in dogs with non-chondrodystrophic phenotype. Study DesignRetrospective computed tomography (CT) morphologic analysis. Sample PopulationHistorical cohort, hindlimb CT scans (n=30). Materials and MethodsThe CT images of 30 normal femurs were uploaded to surgical planning software and 13 points of interest and their respective bend/twist angles were identified on the lateral surfaces. Mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (CV), and range were calculated for each bend/twist angle. Hierarchal clustering and fast Fourier Analyses were used to segment the cohort. Distribution of age, breed, sex, and weight was evaluated between clusters with an exact Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. ResultsThe CV of bending ranged from 17% to 46% and for twisting ranged from 21% to 58%. The greater trochanter was the most pronounced bend on the lateral surface of the femur (meanSD 8.11 +/- 1.35 degrees, CV 17%), and the supracondylar region of the distal femur was the most marked twist (mean +/- SD 48.98 +/- 10.06 degrees, CV 21%). Although there were no differences between dogs in proximal femur anatomy, 2 clusters of 9 and 21 dogs each were identified due to differences in bend/twist angles in the distal femur. There was no difference between clusters for age (P=.85), breed (P=.62), and sex (P=.15); however, weight differed (P=.03) but was not predictive. ConclusionAlthough distal femoral lateral surfaces varied sufficiently to result in 2 population clusters, further analysis is needed to determine if the differences prevent using the mean bending and twisting parameters as a template for clinical applications.

This study was designed to present our experience with treatment of this injury throughout; age, sex, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, method and results of treatment, and complications of floating knee are discussed. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was performed between January 2006 and December 2011. All patients with floating knee injuries who were admitted to the referral educational hospitals were included. The information about the 238 cases of floating knee injuries were gathered through the 254,620 trauma files and after excluding 18 patients who died within 6 months, the remaining files were studied and the target information was recorded. Results: The most frequent age group was 20-29 years (44.5%). The floating knee injuries were more common in males (85.5%). Type (D) according to "the classification of Letts and Vincent" was observed in 38.9% cases. The most frequent mechanism of injury was car to motorcycles accidents (48.2%). The most common associated injury was pelvic fractures (86.8%). Open reduction and internal fixation was the common type of treatment (70%). The most common early and late complications were knee hemarthrosis in 31 cases (14%) and knee osteoarthritis in 30 cases (13.6%), respectively. Death during the 5 years follow up was due to circulatory disruption, followed by deep vein thrombosis (61%). There was a significant relation between the age and outcomes as it worsens with age (P-value < 0.05). Conclusion: This study revealed that the complication rate associated with floating knee injuries remained high, regardless of the used treatment regimen and surgeons should focus on reducing complications while treating it.

However, an aggressive early rehabilitation may lead to non-union of the greater tuberosity. We hypothesise that a delayed rehabilitation will result in a good union rate without undue risk of shoulder stiffness. Materials and methods Between December 1996 and June 2003, 40 patients with three or four part fracture of proximal humerus with or without dislocation, not amenable to open reduction and internal fixation underwent hemiarthroplasty with reconstruction of tuberosities and a conservative rehabilitation regime at our centre (age range of 39-92 with a mean of 68). Pathologic fractures and non-cooperative and/or demented patients were excluded. Patients were kept in a sling for 4 weeks before physiotherapy was commenced. They were reviewed at an average of 55 months (12-95) for assessment of pain, range of movement, activities of daily living and strength. Radiographs were taken to evaluate the union of the greater tuberosity. Results One patient lost to follow up. In 12.8% of the patients (mainly elderly, with mean age of 78.8) the greater tuberosity failed to heal. In those with a healed greater tuberosity the average elevation was more than 130 degrees, and the average external rotation was 40 degrees. A total of 51.3% of the patients had excellent results, 33.3% had satisfactory and 15.4% had unsatisfactory results. Keywords Postoperative immobilisation did not result in excessive stiffness and excellent functional results were achieved, especially in those younger than 70 years of age. However, tuberosity union could not be guarantied in very old patients.

Materials and methods In a retrospective cohort study, the outcome was defined as FNI at 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. Potential predictors included age, sex, etiology, fracture site and pattern (dislocation/non-dislocation), concomitant facial fractures, interval to surgery, surgeons' experience, plate types, and the marginal mandibular branch-traversing approach (deep/superficial group). We employed generalized estimating equations (GEEs) for repeated measurements throughout the 6-month follow-up period. Results Among 102 patients with 114 fractures, 27 patients (26.5%) developed FNI within 1 week. Prolonged FNI (>= 1 month) occurred in 19 (19.2%) of 99 patients. Multivariate GEE analyses revealed that deep surgical approaches (i.e., traditional submandibular and retroparotid approaches; odds ratio [OR], 18.90; p = 0.011), fractures with dislocation (OR, 3.60; p = 0.025), and female gender (OR, 2.71; p = 0.040) were independently associated with the overall FNI risk. Additionally, the deep approaches (OR, 15.91; p = 0.014) and female gender (OR, 3.41; p = 0.035) were correlated with a prolonged FNI risk. Sensitivity analyses for the outcomes identified the same predictors. Conclusion The predictors longitudinally associated with FNI in CN/SCF surgeries included a deep MMB-traversing approach, dislocated fracture, and female gender.

Methods: Twelve 3D finite element models were created to investigate the effect of pullout strength when comparing between pedicle screw types and bone cement clouds. The bottom side of bone block model was constrained and U-shape head was applied 1 mm in direction of longitudinal axis of pedicle screw to perform pullout resistance. The material properties of the FEA was set as linear elastic, homogenous, isotropic condition. The element sensitivity of convergence testing has been performed and variation of the sequential analytical results was less than 3%. Results: The results showed that the maximum total reaction force (133.8 N) was detected in the model of cannulated pedicle screw combined with a central pin with 4 ml cement augmentation, but, in contrast, the minimum total reaction force (106.8 N) was discovered in the model of cannulated pedicle screw without cement. A strong relationship (r = 0.9626) is found in comparison with the biomechanical results between pullout strength of sawbone testing and reaction forces of the FEA. Conclusions: The study concludes that the cannulated pedicle screw can not only provide an inner guider for cement flow and increase bending resistance (deflection effect) when a central pin is selected, but also can improve the pullout strength in the osteoporotic bone to add cement augmentation. The design of the cannulated pedicle screw is suggested for poor bone quality to change pullout failure.

In the present study, composite membranes based on silk fibroin (SF) were fabricated to form a synthetic periosteum. The fabricated membranes were physicochemically characterized by their morphology, porosity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, chemical structure, and mechanical properties. Following the addition of polycaprolactone (PCL) to the silk fibers, there was a 3-5-fold increase in the elongation at break compared with the pure silk membranes, and surface wettability was retained. The degradation time of the SF within the membranes was also prolonged by adding PCL. Compared with pure PCL membranes or plastic culture plates, the SF-based membranes significantly enhanced the cellular viability and osteogenic differentiation capability of MC3T3-E1 cells. Higher expression levels of osteogenic differentiation markers (runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and osteopontin (OP)) further supported the use of the SF component in bone-related applications. A non-rigid internal fixation (non-RIF) fracture model that healed via endochondral bone formation was created, and fracture callus samples were collected to perform micro-computed tomography, histology, and immunohistochemistry analyses at 8 weeks after surgery. A smaller bone volume accompanied by a mineralized bony callus was observed in SF/PCL membrane-treated rats. Immunohistochemistry also indicated that the SF/PCL membrane-treated rats exhibited increased osteocalcin expression but reduced collagen type X expression. These findings could lead to an alternative strategy for treating comminuted fractures with enhanced intramembranous ossification and reduced endochondral ossification.

JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							HEAD-INJURY; CALLUS FORMATION; EXPRESSION; RECEPTOR; SERUM	Purpose: To investigate the occurrence of accelerated bone healing evidenced by early callus formation in patients with mandibular fractures and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed in patients who presented for mandibular fracture evaluation and management over a 6-year period. Subjects eligible for the study included those who underwent a computed tomographic examination of the mandible more than 2 weeks after the injury and had not undergone surgery with rigid internal fixation. TBI was used as the predictor variable. Time to callus formation as detected on computed tomographic scans was recorded as the primary outcome variable. Other variables considered included age, gender, coma duration, and fracture distribution. Appropriate statistical analyses were performed to determine the influencing factors. Results: Forty-five patients with mandibular fractures (24 with severe TBI and 21 without TBI) were retrospectively analyzed. Twelve patients with TBI and 6 without TBI exhibited a visible callus on their computed tomographic scans. Statistical analysis showed no significant differences in age, gender, examination time, and fracture distribution between the groups. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis indicated a positive correlation of time to callus formation with TBI and coma duration but not with age, gender, and fracture distribution. Conclusions: These findings suggest that patients with severe TBI and mandibular fractures exhibit increased fracture healing as evidenced by early callus formation. A more exhaustive study is required to advance the understanding of this phenomenon and provide additional clinical significance.

Although the additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4 V functionally graded porous structure (FGPS) has proven to be the most promising material owing to its good mechanical performance, the impact of porosity gradient pattern on their mechanical performance has scarcely been investigated. In this study, FGPSs with varied porosity gradient pattern and same overall porosity were designed by triply periodic minimal surface and fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), and their structural and mechanical properties were analyzed. A semi-empirical equation was derived to predict the mechanical properties of FGPSs. Hence, we discovered that the lattice with solid core exhibited the best mechanical performance among all FGPS designs. X-ray microscopy (XRM) analysis revealed a strong relationship between the internal micro-porosity of the L-PBFfabricated samples and the dimensions of the manufactured components, further proving the rationale of the lattice with solid core design. In situ compression tests under XRM visualized the different failure mechanisms in the porous and dense portion of the lattice with solid core. The strengthening mechanism of the lattice with solid core was further revealed by finite element analysis. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The literature about ankle fracture sport related is reduced. Severe fractures, fractures-dislocations, syndesmosis lesions, associated osteochondral lesions, postoperative complications, as well as age are associated in several studies with worse functional results and may, therefore, also be associated with a lower rate of sports return. This study aims to retrospectively assess the return to physical activity at the level prior to injury in individuals undergoing surgical treatment of unstable malleolar ankle injuries and to identify risk factors associated with a non-return. Materials and methods We retrospectively evaluated between January 2008 and December 2017, patients with an unstable malleolar fracture of the ankle surgically treated, recreational or competitive sportsman with a minimum follow-up of one year. Demographic data, fracture classification according to AO classification, presence/absence of osteochondral lesion, presence/absence of unstable syndesmosis lesion, associated dislocation, type of surgery, postoperative complications, functional outcome evaluation with the AOFAS score and sports return. Results 92 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean AOFAS score observed was 90.93 (67-100). 69.7% of patients returned without limitations in performing physical activity. 21.75% returned with limitations and 8.7% did not return to physical activity. No association was observed between age, sex, syndesmosis lesion and greater risk of not returning to physical activity. Patients with bimalleolar or trimalleolar fractures, osteochondral injury, or associated dislocation presented an increased risk of inferior functional score and non-return sporting activity. Conclusions Bimalleolar and trimalleolar fractures, associated presence of dislocation and osteochondral lesions are associated with worse clinical outcome and lower return onset.

However, there is concern about whether the MIPO in comminuted proximal humeral fractures is also comparable to open plating. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of open plating and MIPO for acute displaced proximal humeral fractures. Materials and methods: In this prospective, randomized controlled study, 107 patients who had an acute proximal humeral fracture were randomized to either the open plating or MIPO techniques. Forty-five patients treated with open plating and 45 with the MIPO technique who were followed up at least 1 year were evaluated. Shoulder functional assessment, operating time, several radiographic parameters, and complications were evaluated at final follow-up. Results: The mean follow-up period was 15.0 months in the open plating and 14.3 months in the MIPO technique. There were no statistically significant differences in functional assessment scores and radiographic parameters between the two groups. High complications rates were found in 4-part fracture in both surgical methods The average operation time in the MIPO group were significantly lower compared to the open plating group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: This study showed MIPO in proximal humerus fractures had similar clinical and radiographic outcomes compared to the open plating. However, the MIPO technique in proximal humerus fracture provided significantly shorter operation time than the open plating. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of celecoxib on bone healing in rats femur mold with a dose based on body surface area conversion. Materials and Methods: 72 adult female Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups after the internal fixation operation of nondisplaced transverse mid diaphyseal fractures of the right femurs. Each group was treated with 1% methylcellulose, celecoxib (21 mg/kg/d) for 1 week, or celecoxib (21 mg/kg/d) for 4 weeks after surgeries respectively. Bone healing scores and callus formation were evaluated by radiographs at 3, 4, 6 weeks after surgeries. Half of these rats were sacrificed for histological analysis at 4 weeks after surgery. The remaining fractured femurs were evaluated by biomechanical tests at 6 weeks after surgery. Results: The mean radiographic scores for fracture healing of both short and long term groups were lower than that of the control group and the differences among the three groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05) at 3, 4, 6 weeks after surgery. The mean bone trabecula density of both groups was smaller than that of the control group and the differences were also statistically significant (P < 0.05) at 4 week. The maximum load, total energy and stiffness in both the short term and long term groups were significantly decreased compared with those in the control group (P < 0.05) at 6 week. Conclusion: Both short term and long term sustained use of celecoxib in rat models has significantly inhibitory effects on rat fracture healing.

Adduction of the ipsilateral hip joint is necessary to facilitate closed hip nailing for trochanteric fracture. Even though positioning the patient supine with the perineal post against the ipsilateral medial thigh can change the course of the neurovascular structure in the proximal thigh, there have been no reports regarding the position of the femoral artery in the hip nailing position. Materials and methods. We studied the position of the superficial femoral artery in 59 thighs using color-flow duplex scanning method in three hip nailing positions. Results. The mean of the distance between the superficial femoral artery and the femur in 48 normal limbs was 20.28 mm in neutral position (D1), 11.85 mm in 20(o) adduction (D2), and 9.53 mm in 20(o) adduction plus 20(o) internal rotation of the foot plate (D3). The distances D2 and D3 were always shorter than D1 (p<0.001). D3 was less than 10 mm in 30 of the normal limbs (62.5%) and less than 5 mm in 4 (8%). In 11 patients who sustained a trochanteric fracture, the mean of D1, D2, and D3 in the injured limbs was 25.28 mm, 17.98 mm, and 14.38 mm, respectively. The mid-thigh circumference and D3 of the injured limbs were always greater than those of the normal limbs (p<0.001). However, D3 of both sides was less than 10 mm in 3 patients. Conclusion. To lessen the vascular injury during hip nailing, we recommend that the limb be placed in neutral position during preparation of the interlocking holes.

The aim of this study was to analyze results and identify risk factors for an unfavorable outcome.Material and methods: Children and adolescents up to the age of 16 years who sustained a carpal fracture other than in the scaphoid between 2004 and 2021 were reviewed in this single-center retrospective study.Results: In a series of 209 children and adolescents with carpal fractures, 22 had fractures other than the scaphoid. Mean age was 13 years (range 8-16) years, with a total of 41 fractures, with highest incidences for the capitate (10), trapezium (6), triquetrum (4) and pisiform (4). Twenty-nine of these 41 fractures were missed on initial X-ray. Non-displaced fractures were treated with a short arm spica cast including the thumb. Four patients were operated on for displacement fracture or carpometacarpal subluxation. All fractures united, and patients returned to full activities. At the final consultation at a median 14 months (range 6-89) post-injury, all patients with non-displaced fractures were free of symptoms, with excellent Mayo Wrist Scores (MWS). However, three patients with operated trapezium fractures developed early radiological signs of osteoarthritis, two of them with residual pain and MWS rated only good.Conclusion: Non-displaced pediatric carpal fractures treated by forearm cast have excellent prognosis. Fractures of the trapezium with displacement or first carpometacarpal subluxation incur a risk of osteoarthritis despite anatomical reduction and internal fixation.(c) 2023 SFCM.

Herein, metal organic framework-derived in situ-developed ZnIn2S4@C is innovatively synthesized to mediate lithium polysulfide (LPS) conversion based on high electron conductivity and strong chemical interactions for advanced LSBs. Polar ZnIn2S4 possesses strong chemisorption in keeping with the DFT calculation results and catalytic for LPSs, ensuring a high sulfur utilization. Meanwhile, the hollow non-polar carbon frame possessing hierarchical pores not only provides internal space to contain active species but also accommodates efficient electronic transferring and diffusion of lithium ions in the process of cycling. The above advantages make the electrode possess promising stability and good rate performances, achieving long-term and high-rate cycling. Thus, under a sulfur loading of 1.5 mg cm(-2), after 500 cycles, at 2 and 5 C, the as-prepared ZnIn2S4@C@ S delivers reversible capacities of 734 mA h g(-1) (75.7% of the initial capacity with a dropping rate of 0.015% per cycle) and 504 mA h g(-1) (68.5% of the primal capacity with a dropping rate of 0.029% per cycle), respectively. Even at a high sulfur loading of 5.0 mg cm(-2), at 5 C, 65.6% of the initial capacity can be maintained with a low fading rate of 0.430% per cycle after 500 loops with a high Coulombic efficiency of around 99.8%.

Then, the clinical efficacy was evaluated using statistical analysis based on the materials about the Cobb angle of kyphosis, visual analog scale (VAS), Frankel grade, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP).Results:All patients' age ranged from 28 to 64 years (mean 46.216.3). The mean operation time was 145 minutes (range 90-180 mins), intraoperative blood loss was 425mL (range 200-1000mL), and the average bone fusion time was 7.4 months. Postoperative neurological function of Frankel grading was significantly improved compared with that of preoperative. At final follow-up, the kyphosis angle was significantly decreased to 10 +/- 2.1 degrees, the mean VAS score was 1.6 +/- 0.9 showing significant improvement, ESR and CRP returned to normal. The incidence of complications within 3 months after surgery was 25%, and the incidence of complications directly related to surgery was 12.5% (cerebrospinal fluid leakage).Conclusion:On the basis of familiarity with the anatomical structure and combining with the experience of the surgeon, the anterior approach to the lower cervical spine can be an effective treatment method for CTSTB.

However, no studies providing head-to-head comparisons of stainless-steel or titanium-alloy locking plates exist. Materials and methods: Custom-designed identically structured locking plates were made from stainless steel (F138 and F1314) or titanium alloy. Three screw-hole designs were compared: threaded screw-holes with angle edges (type I); threaded screw-holes with chamfered edges (type II); and non-threaded screw-holes with chamfered edges (type III). The plates' bending stiffness, bending strength, and fatigue life, were investigated. The stress concentration at the screw threads was assessed using finite element analyses (FEA). Results: The titanium plates had higher bending strength than the F1314 and F138 plates (2.95: 1.56: 1) in static loading tests. For all metals, the type-III plate fatigue life was highest, followed by type-II and type-I. The type-III titanium plates had longer fatigue lives than their F138 counterparts, but the type-I and type-II titanium plates had significantly shorter fatigue lives. All F1314 plate types had longer fatigue lives than the type-III titanium plates. The FEA showed minimal stress difference (0.4%) between types II and III, but the stress for types II and III was lower (11.9% and 12.4%) than that for type I. Conclusions: The screw threads did not cause stress concentration in the locking plates in FEA, but may have jeopardized the fatigue strength, especially in the notch-sensitive titanium plates. Improvement to the locking plate design is necessary. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Outcome and incidence of periprosthetic supracondylar femoral fractures in TKA	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Distal femoral locking plate; periprosthetic fracture; supracondylar femur fracture; total knee arthroplasty	TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY; FEMUR FRACTURES; MANAGEMENT	Background: Periprosthetic supracondylar femoral fractures following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are infrequent, but is a devastating complication. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence and outcomes of periprosthetic supracondylar femoral fractures following TKA using nonoperative as well as open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) techniques. Materials and Methods: Between January 2004 and December 2010, we followed 3,920 operated patients of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and identified 23 patients with periprosthetic supracondylar fractures. A retrospective analysis of the records of these patients was conducted. Details regarding pre fracture status, treatment offered and the present status were also recorded and analyzed. Time from index arthroplasty to periprosthetic fracture ranged from five days to six years. There were 17 women and 6 men and the average age was 68.26 years (range 52-83 years). Of the 23 patients, 20 patients were treated by operative method, whereas only three patients with relatively undisplaced fractures were treated nonoperatively. Results: The total incidence of periprosthetic fractures in operated cases of TKA was 0.58%. Three patients had infection after surgery. As per radiological assessment, two of three conservatively treated cases had malunion, whereas among 20 cases treated operatively, 16 had primary union with one malunion. Two patients had union after bone grafting, whereas two had nonunion. The average reduction in the knee score after fracture was 20.53%. Twenty one patients were able to achieve limited but independent activity. Conclusions: Desirable results for periprosthetic fractures can be obtained if proper and timely intervention is done, taking into account the other comorbid conditions. However, short duration of followup and small number of patients were major limiting factors in this study.

Materials and methods: The study included 42 patients (34 male, 8 female) who underwent surgery for pilon fractures and were followed up. The mean follow-up period of the patients was 72 months (range: 36-102 months). The patients were classified into 2 groups as Ruedi-Allgower (RA) Type II, including 20 patients and RA Type 111, including 22 patients. The fibula fractures of the patients were classified according to the Weber classification. The reduction quality was determined by evaluating the early postoperative graphs of the patients based on the scale defined by Conroy etal. The standard anterior-posterior and side graphs were investigated for arthrosis. The clinical evaluation of the ankles of the patients was based on the rating scale of Teeny and Wiss. Results: In the RA Type II group, Weber B fibular fractures were significantly more common and, in the RA Type III group, Weber C fibular fractures were significantly more common (P < 0.001). Comparisons of the fibular fracture types revealed that in Weber Type C fractures, the incidence of posttraumatic arthrosis was higher (P < 0.05). The clinical evaluations recorded on the final controls of the patients showed that sufficient outcome was achieved in 55% of the patients with RA Type II fractures and in 45.5% of the patients with the RA Type III fractures. Conclusion: The type of fibular fracture and the presence of syndesmotic injury affect the functional outcome of pilon fractures.

Previous studies have shown the usefulness of combining information from different data sources to identify and analyse variations in transfusion practices. Good knowledge of the conditions leading to blood use is a fundamental requirement for the assessment of the appropriateness of blood transfusion. Materials and methods. In this study we combined blood transfusion data obtained from the Blood Bank information system with patients' data from the Hospital Discharge Database, based on the ICD9 classification system, from 1,827 surgical procedures performed in seven different orthopaedic divisions in the Ravenna area between January and December 2009. Hip and knee replacement surgery (primary or revision) and operations following femoral fractures (partial hip replacement and reduction with internal fixation) were considered. For a subgroup of patients clinical and transfusion data were also combined with haemoglobin values obtained from the laboratory information system. Results. Of the 1,827 surgical procedures, 1,038 (56.8%) were followed by transfusion of red cells. The likelihood of receiving a transfusion varied depending on the patient's sex (49% for males, 60% for females), age, and on the surgical procedure, being higher for interventions following femoral fractures and for revisions of hip replacement: about 70% of patients undergoing these interventions required transfusion. A large variability in transfusion rates was observed between the seven divisions, which was only partially explained by the different types of surgery (post-traumatic or elective) performed by any of them: relevant variations were also observed for the same type of intervention. Discussion. Combining information from different data sources could be a time-sparing way to gain useful information about transfusion practices, so contributing to optimising blood usage.

Materials and methods: Anatomic study was performed on 16 shoulders of unembalmed cadavers. A proximal humeral internal locking system (PHILOS) plate was placed to simulate the osteosynthesis of a fracture of humeral surgical neck. The relationships between the plate and the nerve were evaluated. Selective dissection of all the nerve branches inside the deltoid muscle was performed. Results: The mean distance between the point where the AN entered into the deltoid muscle and the humeral head was 5.0 cm, and it was 6.8 cm from the acromion. The mean distance between the origins of the anterior and posterior branches of the axillary nerve was 5.4 cm. The mean diameter of the AN was 0.57 cm, the anterior branch diameter was 0.40 cm, of posterior branch diameter was 0.33 cm, and the teres minor branch diameter was 0.24 cm. The application of the PHILOS plate demonstrated that in 100% of cases, the 2 distal holes of the plate of those dedicated to the humeral head coincided with the passage of AN. Discussion: The different patterns of nerve branches inside the deltoid muscle show that the "safe zone" during transdeltoid approaches is the anterior region of the deltoid muscle for a maximum of 6.7 cm from the acromion. In addition, the insertion of the 2 distal screws of those dedicated to humeral head of the plate should be avoided.

J	Brilhault, J				Brilhault, Jean			Single Medial Approach to Modified Double Arthrodesis in Rigid Flatfoot with Lateral Deficient Skin	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Valgus Deformity; Hindfoot; Arthrodesis	TRIPLE ARTHRODESIS; INTERNAL-FIXATION; FOLLOW-UP; ADULTS; HINDFOOT; DEFORMITY; SUBTALAR; JOINTS; FOOT	Background: Triple arthrodesis through a two-incision approach is the traditional surgical treatment of fixed flatfoot in adults. However, since it limits motion and forces the remaining joints to absorb more load, long-term studies report diminishing results over time from symptomatic breakdown of adjacent joints. In addition, wound-healing problems have been reported in up one-third of patients undergoing a major flatfoot reconstruction which are more commonly associated with the anterolateral approaches. Therefore, since 2003, we have been interested in selective arthrodesis of the subtalar and talonavicular joints sparing the uninvolved calcaneocuboid joint and the lateral skin. Materials and Method: We have performed this procedure in 11 patients (14 feet) who had deficient lateral skin and a fixed hindfoot valgus deformity where adequate correction may have led to lateral wound complication. They were followed in a prospective fashion and assessed at a minimum of 6 months followup. Results: Wound healing occurred without any complications in all cases. Evaluation was performed at an average of 21.5 (range, 6 to 50) months. Significant radiographic improvements were observed on each measurement: anteroposterior talonavicular coverage angle improved from 38.5 degrees to 7 degrees, lateral talo-first metatarsal angle improved from 21 degrees to 0 degrees, hindfoot frontal alignment angle improved from 18 degrees to 7.5 degrees. All patients had an asymptomatic calcaneocuboid joint. Conclusion: Arthrodesis of the subtalar and talonavicular joints through a medial approach combined with peroneal lengthening is a reliable procedure for the treatment of rigid flatfoot with deficient lateral skin without calcaneocuboid joint degeneration.

Material and methods: Retrospective study of 537 patients aged >= 65 years who survived at the sixth month after fracturing their hip, of which the age, sex, type of fracture, surgical risk, independence (BI), walking ability, cognitive level (PS), comorbidities, indicated drugs, complications, surgical delay, hospital stay, and surgical technique are known. Using Pearson's chi(2) test, all the variables were contrasted with respect to the limitation or not, at the sixth month of the recovery of both independence and pre-admission walking ability. Multivariate analysis provides the necessary adjustment to the previous contrast. Results: We have found that age and PS >= 5 at admission limit recovery from both dependency and walking ability. Surgical risk, independence (BI) upon admission, anemia, and constipation during the hospital stay limit the recovery of the BI. Worsening of walking ability during the hospital stay and the type of extra-articular fracture, which was surgically treated by osteosynthesis, limit the recovery of walking ability. Conclusions: The factors previously exposed, and perhaps the fact that patients with hip fractures are not routinely referred to rehabilitation, explain the high proportion of patients who do not recover their previous independency (36%) or walking ability (45%) to the fact of fracturing.

J	Tsao, HM; Sun, YC; Liou, DM				Tsao, Hsiao-Mei; Sun, Ying-Chou; Liou, Der-Ming			A Rational Approach to Estimating the Surgical Demand Elasticity Needed to Guide Manpower Reallocation during Contagious Outbreaks	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INFECTION-CONTROL; SARS OUTBREAK; EPIDEMIC; FEAR	Background Emerging infectious diseases continue to pose serious threats to global public health. So far, however, few published study has addressed the need for manpower reallocation needed in hospitals when such a serious contagious outbreak occurs. Aim To quantify the demand elasticity of the major surgery types in order to guide future manpower reallocation during contagious outbreaks. Materials and Methods Based on a nationwide research database in Taiwan, we extracted the monthly volumes of major surgery types for the period 1998-2003, which covered the SARS period, in order to carry out a time series analysis. The demand elasticity of each surgery type was then estimated by autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) analysis. Results During the study period, the surgical volumes of most selected surgery types either increased or remained steady. We categorized these surgery types into low-, moderate- and high-elastic groups according to their demand elasticity. Appendectomy, 'open reduction of fracture with internal fixation' and 'free skin graft' were in the low demand elasticity group. Transurethral prostatectomy and extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) were in the high demand elasticity group. The manpower of the departments carrying out the surgeries with low demand elasticity should be maintained during outbreaks. In contrast, departments in charge of surgeries mainly with high demand elasticity, like urology departments, may be in a position to have part of their staff reallocated. Conclusions Taking advantage of the demand variation during the SARS period in 2003, we adopted the concept of demand elasticity and used a time series approach to figure out an effective index of demand elasticity for various types of surgery that could be used as a rational reference to carry out manpower reallocation during contagious outbreak situations.

Bone substitute first or screws first? A biomechanical comparison of two operative techniques for tibial-head depression fractures	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SCIENCE			English	Article							CALCIUM-PHOSPHATE CEMENT; PLATEAU FRACTURES; GRAFT SUBSTITUTES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION	Background The aim of this study was to investigate a drillable and injectable bone substitute (calcium phosphate cement) and the operative technique enabled by the drillable option in a new biomechanical fracture model for tibial depression fractures in synthetic bones. Materials and methods Lateral depression fractures of the tibial plateau (AO 41-B2, Schatzker III) were created in a biomechanical fracture model in three different synthetic bones (Sawbone 3401, Synbone 1110/1116). Reproducible fractures were generated employing Synbone 1110, which exhibited a comparable strength to human osteoporotic bones and was used for the further experiments. After reduction of the fractures, the stabilization was performed with two different operative techniques. In group 1, first an osteosynthesis with four screws was performed and then the metaphyseal defect was filled up with calcium phosphate cement (Norian drillable). In group 2, initially the filling up with Norian drillable was done enabling a complete filling of the defect, followed by placing of the screws. Displacement under cyclic loading with 250 N for 3,000 cycles, stiffness, and maximum load in load-to-failure tests were determined. Results A comparison of the two operative techniques of stabilization showed a distinctly lower displacement and higher stiffness for group 2 when the defect was filled up first. For the maximum load, no significant differences could be demonstrated. Conclusions A complete filling of the defect by first applying the calcium phosphate cement significantly reduces the secondary loss of reduction of the depression fracture fragment under cyclic loading with a clinically relevant partial weight bearing. The beneficial effects of drillable calcium phosphate cement may also be transferable to defects other than tibial-head depression fractures.

JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							ORBITAL FRACTURES; INFRAORBITAL RIM; SUBCILIARY; FLOOR	Purpose: The subtarsal incision is a frequently used approach to orbital floor fractures. Compared with the subciliary incision, there is a lower rate of lower lid retraction. Unlike the transconjunctival incision, there is no need to perform a lateral canthoplasty to restore canthal integrity. Despite its widespread use, the exact location of the subtarsal incision is not uniform among surgeons. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients underwent open reduction and internal fixation of orbital floor fractures by a single surgeon over a 4-month period, using the subtarsal incision. Postoperative photographs of the first 7 consecutive patients were analyzed by 4 nonmedical personnel and 4 plastic surgeons regarding scar visibility. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine if a correlation existed between more inferior placement of the scar and scar visibility. Results: No patients in the series developed any complications such as lower lid retraction or enophthalmos. One patient developed transient facial palsy. The results of the survey showed a positive correlation between distance from lash line to scar and scar visibility at the level of the lateral limbus (Pearson r coefficient, 0.73) and at the level of the lateral canthal angle (Pearson r coefficient, 0.65). Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that the optimal placement of the subtarsal incision is as close as possible to the inferior border of the tarsal plate. The incision should be placed within an existing skin crease, if possible, and should be made with the knowledge that the more inferior the incision is placed, the greater the visualization of the fracture, but the more visible the scar.

Comparison of Rietveld-compatible structureless fitting analysis methods for accurate quantification of carbon dioxide fixation in ultramafic mine tailings	AMERICAN MINERALOGIST			English	Article						Carbon accounting; X-ray diffraction; Rietveld analysis; PONKCS method; Pawley/internal standard method; serpentine; amorphous material; pyroaurite; hydromagnesite	QUANTITATIVE PHASE-ANALYSIS; POWDER DIFFRACTION DATA; CO2 SEQUESTRATION; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; PREFERRED ORIENTATION; TRANSITION-METALS; ANION-EXCHANGE; THETFORD MINES; ASBESTOS MINE; AIR CAPTURE	The carbonation of ultramafic rocks, including tailings from ultramafic-hosted ore deposits, can be used to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and store it safely within minerals over geologic timescales. Quantitative X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Rietveld refinements can be employed to estimate the amount of carbon sequestered by carbonate minerals that form as a result of weathering of ultramafic rocks. However, the presence of structurally disordered phases such as serpentine minerals, which are common in ultramafic ore bodies such as at the Woodsreef chrysotile mine (New South Wales, Australia), results in samples that cannot be analyzed using typical Rietveld refinement strategies. Previous investigations of carbon sequestration at Woodsreef and other ultramafic mine sites typically used modified Rietveld refinement methods that apply structureless pattern fitting for disordered phases; however, no detailed comparison of the accuracy (or precision) of these methods for carbon accounting has yet been attempted, making it difficult to determine the most appropriate analysis method. Such an analysis would need to test whether some methods more accurately quantify the abundances of certain minerals, such as pyroaurite [Mg6Fe23+(CO3)(OH)(16)center dot 4H(2)O] and other hydrotalcite group minerals, which suffer from severe preferred orientation and may play an important role in carbon sequestration at some mines. Here, we assess and compare the accuracy, and to a lesser extent the precision, of three different non-traditional Rietveld refinement methods for carbon accounting: (1) the PONKCS method, (2) the combined use of a Pawley fit for serpentine minerals and an internal standard (Pawley/internal standard method), and (3) the combined use of PONKCS and Pawley/internal standard methods. We examine which of these approaches represents the most accurate way to quantify the abundances of serpentine, pyroaurite, and other carbonate-bearing phases in a given sample. We demonstrate that by combining the PONKCS and Pawley/internal standard methods it is possible to quantify the abundances of disordered phases in a sample and to obtain an estimate of the amorphous content and any unaccounted intensity in an XRD pattern. Eight artificial tailings samples with known mineralogical compositions were prepared to reflect the natural variation found within the tailings at the Woodsreef chrysotile mine. Rietveld refinement results for the three methods were compared with the known compositions of each sample to calculate absolute and relative error values and to evaluate the accuracy of the three methods, including whether they produce systematic under- or overestimates of mineral abundance. Estimated standard deviations were also calculated during refinements; these values, which are a measure of precision, were not strongly affected by the choice of refinement method. The abundance of serpentine minerals is, however, systematically overestimated when using the PONKCS and Pawley/internal standard methods, and the abundances of minor phases (<10 wt%) are systematically underestimated using all three methods. Refined abundances for pyroaurite were found to be increasingly susceptible to error with increasing abundance, with an underestimation of 6.6 wt% absolute (60.6% relative) for a sample containing 10 9 wt% pyroaurite. These significant errors are due to difficulties in mitigating preferred orientation of hydrotalcite minerals during sample preparation as well as modeling its effects on XRD patterns. The abundances of hydromagnesite [Mg,(CO3)(4)(OH)(2)center dot 4H(2)O], another important host for atmospheric CO2 during weathering of ultramafic rocks, was consistently underestimated by all three methods, with the highest underestimation being 3.7 wt% absolute (or 25.0% relative) for a sample containing 15.0 wt% hydromagnesite. Overall, the Pawley/internal standard method produced more accurate results than the PONKCS method, with an average bias per refinement of 6.7 wt%, compared with 10.3 wt% using PONKCS and 12.9 wt% for the combined PONKCS-Pawley/internal standard method. Furthermore, the values for the refined abundance of hydromagnesite obtained from refinements using the Pawley/internal standard method were significantly more accurate than those for refinements done with the PONKCS method, with relative errors typically <25% for hydromagnesite abundances between 5 and 15 wt%. The simpler and faster sample preparation makes the PONKCS method well-suited for rapid carbon accounting, for instance in the field using a portable XRD; however, the superior accuracy gained when using an internal standard make the Pawley/internal standard method the preferable means of undertaking a detailed laboratory-based study. As all three methods displayed an underestimation of carbonate phases, applying these methods to natural samples will likely produce an underestimate of hydromagnesite and hydrotalcite group mineral abundances. As such, crystallographic accounting strategies that use modified Rietveld refinement methods produce a conservative estimate of the carbon sequestered in minerals.

However, thermal osteonecrosis may occur when a pin is inserted using a drill. There have been no reports on late-onset fractures at the Steinmann pin insertion site. Materials and Methods: A 32-year-old man who underwent surgery for a femoral shaft fracture 5 years ago complained of proximal thigh pain 1 month after the removal of the internal device. On physical examination, the patient showed a limping gait due to pain, and tenderness was observed on the lateral aspect of the proximal thigh. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed because the symptoms did not improve, despite conservative treatment. A new fracture line was observed in the lateral cortical bone of the proximal femur. It was found that a fracture occurred at the site where the Steinmann pin was inserted for a closed reduction at the time of the first operation. The patient was instructed to limit weight bearing and to use crutches while walking. Parathyroid hormone was additionally administered to promote bone formation. Results: Six months after diagnosis, a complete union was achieved at the subtrochanteric fracture site, and the patient's pain subsided. Conclusions: A fracture that occurs as a late onset at the provisional Steinmann pin insertion site is an extremely rare complication; however, orthopedic surgeons must consider this possibility and make more efforts to lower the occurrence of thermal damage. In addition, if the patient complains of pain in the region where the pin was inserted after surgery, surgeons should spare no effort to determine whether a new fracture has occurred.

We have introduced a new surgical technique for dual plating of periprosthetic distal femur fractures following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and determined the clinical and radiological outcomes of minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) with a dual locking compression plate (LCP).Materials and methodsBetween January 2010 and July 2019, 18 patients [mean age, 74.8 (68-89) years; average follow-up period, 14.8 (12-43) months] underwent MIPO with distal femoral LCP laterally and proximal humeral internal locking system (PHILOS) medially for periprosthetic distal femoral fractures following TKA. The minimum follow-up was 1 year. The clinical and radiological outcomes were assessed using the modified WOMAC scores, knee range of motion, time to callus formation, time to union, and complications of malunion, nonunion, and shortening.ResultsThe average time to union was 18.4weeks (range, 10-51weeks) and to callus formation was 7.8weeks (range, 2-14weeks). At the 1-year follow-up, the average JLETS was 37.6 (range, 24-53), average knee ROM was 110.3 degrees (range, 80-135 degrees), and average varus-valgus angles of the distal femur were 3.2 degrees (range, -2.9-10.5 degrees). No nonunion, broken plates, or implant failure occurred. Malunion occurred in three patients.ConclusionMIPO with dual LCP is a reliable method for stabilizing periprosthetic distal femoral fractures following TKA, with satisfactory bone union rates and low complication rates.

Materials and methods: Skeletal Class II malocclusion patients who underwent bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy (BSSRO) were included. Three-dimensional reconstruction was based on one-week and one-year post-operative CT scans. The condylar morphological alterations were assessed by anterior-posterior, medial-lateral diameter and condylar height. The mandibular relapse was calculated by the positional changes of pogonion, menton, gonions, gnathion and mental foramens. All data were measured by MIMICS and analyzed by SPSS software; significance was set at p<0.05. Results: 31 patients (62 condyles) were enrolled into this study. 28 of 62 condyles showed resorption beyond 1 mm on condylar height and 15 were beyond 2 mm. Positional changes of chin, mental foramens and gonion were respectively 1.57 +/- 2.36 mm, 1.31 +/- 1.23 mm and 1.42 +/- 1.02 mm. 21 of 31 patients experienced mandibular relapse less than 1 mm but additional 4 patients showing relapse more than 2 mm. Correlation with moderate intensity could be observed between condylar height alteration and post-operative mandibular displacement more than 1 mm (p = 0.035). Conclusion: The resorption degree of condylar height can be regarded as a useful parameter for evaluating post-operative skeletal relapse.

Achieving union is paramount while minimizing complications. An essential item for successful union is preparation of the articular surface. Our study aims to evaluate the difference in joint preparation between direct lateral and dual mini-open approaches. Materials and Methods Ten below knee fresh-frozen specimens were used for this study. Five were prepared through lateral approach, and five using dual mini-incisions. After preparation, all ankles were dissected and images of tibial plafond and talar articular surfaces were taken. Surface areas of articulating facets and unprepared cartilage of talus, distal tibia, and distal fibula were measured and analyzed. Results A greater amount of total surface area was prepared with the mini-open approach in comparison to the transfibular approach. Percentage of prepared surface area of total articulating surface (including talus and tibia/fibula), talus, tibia, and fibula with the transfibular approach were 76.9%, 77.7%, and 75%, respectively. Percentages were 90.9%, 92.9%, and 88.6% with the mini-open approach. When excluding medial gutter, there was no significant difference between techniques (83.94% vs. 90.85%,p = 0.1412). Conclusion Joint preparation with the mini-open approach is equally efficacious as the transfibular approach for the tibiotalar joint. The mini-open approach does provide superior preparation of the medial gutter and inferior tibial surface which may help to increase union rates and decreased complications.

Diversity and taxonomic identification of <i>Shionodiscus</i> spp. in the Australian sector of the Subantarctic Zone	DIATOM RESEARCH			English	Article						diatom; Shionodiscus; taxonomy; Southern Ocean; sediment traps	POLAR FRONTAL ZONES; OCEAN SURFACE SEDIMENTS; MAJOR DIATOM TAXA; SOUTHERN-OCEAN; GENUS THALASSIOSIRA; PACIFIC-OCEAN; BERING-SEA; PHYTOPLANKTON; ASSEMBLAGES; WATERS	Diatoms are siliceous phytoplankton that play a major role in global carbon fixation, as well as forming the basis of most marine food webs. In the Southern Ocean, diatoms are responsible for significant volumes of carbon export and sequestration in the deep sea. Diatoms are unicellular and microscopic, thus diatom taxonomy has naturally progressed as imaging and molecular technologies have developed. Despite recent advancements, some aspects of diatom taxonomy remain unclear. The genus Shionodiscus was separated from Thalassiosira in 2006, and possesses, as a group, internal extensions of the marginal strutted processes as well as a labiate process on the valve face, usually distant from the margin. The features distinguishing Shionodiscus from Thalassiosira, and Shionodiscus spp. from each other, are difficult to examine under light microscopy, and most taxonomists will group similar Shionodiscus species together when encountered, rather than discriminating species. As a result, the full extent of Shionodiscus diversity is rarely examined in individual studies. In this study, sediment trap material captured in the Australian sector of the Subantarctic Zone was examined using both light and scanning electron microscopy, and compared to known measurements on Shionodiscus species and varieties. This study had two aims; to catalogue for the first time the diversity of Shionodiscus spp. within the Australian sector, and to create a formalized set of criteria for grouping Shionodiscus species, when only light microscopy analysis is possible. By documenting Shionodiscus diversity in the Australian sector and establishing a standard identification protocol, researchers will be better able to determine the ecological significance of the genus in diatom assemblages.

J	Hwang, DS; Kim, YI; Lee, KM				Hwang, Dae-Seok; Kim, Yong-Il; Lee, Kyung-Min			Effect of intended manual condylar positioning on skeletal and dental changes in Skeletal Class III deformities: CBCT-generated Half-Cephalograms	JOURNAL OF CRANIO-MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article						Intended manual condylar positioning; CBCT-generated Cephalogram	SPLIT RAMUS OSTEOTOMY; RIGID INTERNAL-FIXATION; TEMPOROMANDIBULAR-JOINT; MANDIBULAR ADVANCEMENT; STABILITY; SURGERY; ANGLE	Introduction: To investigate the effect of intended manual condylar positioning on skeletal changes from preoperative stage to posttreatment stage. Materials and methods: The sample comprised 23 patients divided into two groups according to surgery type: mandible-only setback surgery (group I) versus 2-jaw surgery (group II). CBCT-generated Half-Cephalograms were fabricated to evaluate the skeletal, dental, and condylar positioning changes for each subject at three time points (preoperatively (T0), immediate-postoperatively (T1), and posttreatment (T2)). Results: The angle of the proximal segment in group II was reduced immediate-postoperatively. In both groups, the result showed a negative mean value for the horizontal mandibular position (B point to N-perpendicular plane at T2-T1 stage). In group II, the vertical mandibular position (B point to FH plane at T2-T1 stage) also had a negative mean value. In group I, the change of the B point to N-perpendicular plane (T2-T1) had statistically significant correlations with the change of the Cd to Po-perpendicular plane (T2-T1). In group II, the change of the B point to the N-perpendicular plane (T2-T1) had statistically significant correlations with the change of the angle Cd-Cp-FH plane angle (T2-T1) and the Cp to FH plane (T1-T0). Conclusions: In this study, the change from the T1 to T2 stage, though not statistically significant, showed a negative short-term relapse. Intended manual condylar positioning may suppress the short-term skeletal relapse. (C) 2013 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Pal, JN; Banik, R				Pal, Jitendra N.; Banik, Rajeeb			Monoaxial distraction of ulna to second metacarpal followed by single bone forearm in massive post infective radial bone loss	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Massive radial shaft loss; monoaxial distractor; single bone forearm; ulna to metacarpal distraction	CLUBHAND DEFORMITY; NONUNION; CENTRALIZATION	Introduction: Radial bone loss associated with gross manus valgus deformity can be managed by open reduction internal fixation using intervening strut bone graft, callus distraction using ring or monoaxial fixator, and achieving union by distraction histogenesis. These methods are particularly suitable when bone loss is small. Single or staged procedure is described for congenital as well as in acquired extensive bone loss of radius. Distraction through radial proximal to distal segments, to achieve reduction of distal radio-ulnar joint (DRUJ), is also described in acquired cases. In the present series, functional results of distraction through ulna to 2nd metacarpal is studied alongwith, functional status of hand, stability of wrist, level of patient's satisfaction are also studied. Materials and Methods: 7 unilateral cases of radial loss (M = 5, F = 2) affecting 4 right hands of mean age 17 years (range 9 to 24 years) were included in this study. They were treated by distracting through ulna to 2nd metacarpal to achieve DRUJ alignment in first stage. Subsequently ulna was osteotomised and translated to distal stump of radius. It was then fixed to the distal radial remnant in 30 degrees pronation in dominant and 30 supination non dominant hands. Results: Union was achieved in all cases associated with beneficial cross union of distal ulna. Hand functions improved near to normal, with fully corrected stable wrist joint, hypertrophied ulna and without recurrence. All of them had practically complete loss of forearm rotations, however patients were fully satisfied. Conclusion: This method is particularly suitable when associated with 6 cm or more radial bone loss. But when loss is small, sacrifice of one bone may not be justifiable.

J	Geng, JX; Liang, CZ				Geng, Jianxin; Liang, Chengzhi			Analysis of the Internal Relationship between Ecological Value and Economic Value Based on the Forest Resources in China	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						forest ecosystem value; balance sheet of natural resources; environmental and economic accounting	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CHOICE EXPERIMENTS; VALUATION; WETLAND; DESIGN; MODEL; GIS	In this study, we applied gross ecosystem product (GEP) theory in a case study to analyze and explain the natural resource asset value and ecosystem service value of forest resources in Jiaokou County, Shanxi Province, Northern China, in 2018. GEP refers to the total value of various final material products and services provided by ecosystems. In this paper, six service functions of a forest system, including water conservation, soil conservation, carbon fixation and oxygen release, forest nutrients, purification of atmospheric environment, and biodiversity, are valued by three calculation methods: the alternative cost method, market value method, and control cost method. The study revealed the following: (1) There is a parallel relationship between the value of natural resource assets and the value of ecosystem services. GEP includes the market value of natural resource assets, but it is mostly the value of ecosystem services. (2) The measurement of the physical quantity of forest ecosystem services depends on parameter data, and the monetary calculation often has no mature pricing basis, which leads to the large scale and uncertainty surrounding the evaluation results of ecosystem services. (3) The ecosystem service value and natural resource asset value have different practical significance, as well as alternate theoretical bases. The value of natural resource assets can be used as the asset valuation basis of economic transactions, which plays a role in macroeconomic management. The value of ecosystem services can be used as the basis of ecological compensation, providing information for the preparation of the balance sheet of natural resources.

Dominance of in situ produced particulate organic carbon in a subtropical reservoir inferred from carbon stable isotopes	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON; INLAND WATERS; SAO-PAULO; BOHAI SEA; LAKE; FRACTIONATION; DYNAMICS; RIVER; CO2; ECOSYSTEM	Sources of particulate organic carbon (POC) play important roles in aqueous carbon cycling because internal production can provide labile material that can easily be turned into CO2. On the other hand, more recalcitrant external POC inputs can cause increased loads to sedimentary organic matter that may ultimately cause CH4 release. In order to differentiate sources, stable isotopes offer a useful tool. We present a study on the Itupararanga Reservoir (Brazil) where origins of POC were explored by comparing its isotope ratios (delta C-13(POC)) to those of dissolved inorganic carbon (delta C-13(DIC)). The delta C-13(POC) averaged around - 25.1 parts per thousand in near-surface waters, which indicates higher primary production inferred from a fractionation model that takes into account carbon transfer with a combined evaluation of delta C-13(POC), delta C-13(DIC) and aqueous CO2. However, delta C-13(POC) values for water depths from 3 to 15 m decreased to - 35.6% and indicated different carbon sources. Accordingly, the delta C-13(DIC) values of the reservoir averaged around + 0.6 parts per thousand in the top 3 m of the water column. This indicates CO2 degassing and photosynthesis. Below this depth, DIC isotope values of as low as - 10.1 parts per thousand showed stronger influences of respiration. A fractionation model with both isotope parameters revealed that 24% of the POC in the reservoir originated from detritus outside the reservoir and 76% of it was produced internally by aqueous CO2 fixation.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the skeletal stability between large and small counterclockwise rotational advancement of the mandible in patients with skeletal class II deformity. Materials and methods This retrospective study included 50 adult patients with skeletal class II deformity corrected by Le Fort I setback and bilateral sagittal split osteotomy counterclockwise rotational advancement. Patients were divided into two groups, according to the amount of counterclockwise rotation: small rotation (n = 25) and large rotation (n = 25). Serial cone beam computed tomography scans were analyzed to identify skeletal and dental position from presurgery to at least 12 months postsurgery. Changes in the facial skeleton (maxilla and mandible) and teeth (central incisor and first molar) were determined for six skeletal and four dental landmarks by measures before treatment (T0) and 1 week postsurgery (T1), and from T1 to at least 12 months postsurgery (T2). Results A relapse was found both after large and small rotational advancement of the mandible (pogonion: 1.0 (2.4) mm and 1.4 (3.0) mm, respectively). The result was statistically significant (both p < 0.05) and was with less than 1.5 mm clinically acceptable. There were no between-group differences in the postsurgical horizontal and vertical mandibular stability. Conclusions The results suggest that counterclockwise rotational advancement of the mandible using bilateral sagittal split osteotomy is a clinically stable procedure. The amount of rotation does not affect the postsurgical stability of the mandible.

Due to the lack of close-packed TCBPE chromophores in Hf-TCBPE, which was required for aggregation-induced ECL (AI-ECL) enhancement, we defined this unprecedented phenomenon as matrix coordination-induced ECL (MCI-ECL) enhancement. The strong ECL intensity of Hf-TCBPE not only originated from the fixation of the TCBPE ligand between Hf-6 clusters that restricted the intramolecular free motions of TCBPE and suppressed the nonradiative relaxation but also stemmed from the high porosity of Hf-TCBPE that rendered both internal and external TCBPE chromophores able to be excited. Considering the unique ECL characteristic of Hf-TCBPE, we combined the new ECL indicator of Hf-TCBPE as well as the phosphate-terminal ferrocene (Fc)-labeled hairpin DNA (Fc-HP3) aptamer together as a signal probe (Hf-TCBPE/Fc-HP3), which was employed to construct a novel "off-on" ECL sensor for ultrasensitive mucin 1 (MUC1) detection with the assistance of the exonuclease III (Exo III)-assisted recycling amplification strategy. As expected, the ECL sensor displayed a desirable linear response range from I fg/mL to 1 ng/mL and the detection limit down to 0.49 fg/mL. The MCI-ECL enhancement demonstrated by the Hf-TCBPE developed a new and promising strategy to design and synthesize high-performance metal-organic framework (MOF)-based ECL materials for constructing ultrasensitive ECL sensors.

Patients with hematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis (HVO) occasionally require instrumentation for spinal stabilization. However, placing instrumentation in the setting of spinal infection raises concerns about recurrent infection due to bacteria adhering to the foreign material. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic outcomes of patients with HVO who underwent instrumented surgery. Methods. We conducted a retrospective chart review of adult patients with microbiologically diagnosed HVO who underwent surgical intervention in 5 tertiary care hospitals over an 8-year period. Results. A total of 153 patients with HVO underwent surgical management for their infections. Of these 153 patients, 94 (61.4%) underwent surgical debridement alone (noninstrumented surgery) and 59 (38.6%) underwent surgical debridement and instrumentation (instrumented surgery). The median durations of antibiotic therapy were 66 and 80 days for the noninstrumentation and instrumentation groups, respectively (P=.22). Clinical outcomes were similar between the groups, including rates of infection-related death (2.1% vs 0%; P=.52), primary failure (1.1% vs 5.1%; P=.30), and recurrence (4.8% vs 6.8%; P=.72). Among the instrumentation group, there was a significant decreasing trend for recurrence according to total duration of antibiotic therapy: 22.2% (4-6 weeks), 9.1% (6-8 weeks), and 2.6% (>= 8 weeks; P=.04). Duration of pre-instrumentation antibiotic therapy and single-stage operation (vs 2-stage operation) were not risk factors for recurrence. Conclusions. Spinal instrumentation in patients with HVO may be safe with pathogen-directed prolonged antibiotic therapy and should not be abandoned or delayed solely because of the risk of recurrence.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the technique provides stability to match that of conventional (fixed-angle) angle-stable constructs. Material and methods: In seven pairs of human cadaver radii, an Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthese (AO) 23 C2.1 intra-articular fracture was created. One radius of each pair received a juxta-articular 2.4-mm locking compression plate (LCP) Volar Distal Radius Plate, whilst the contralateral one received a 2.4-mm Variable Angle Locking Compression Plate (LCP) Two-Column Volar Distal Radius Plate (both plates: Synthes, Oberdorf, Switzerland). Parameters tested were construct stiffness (static axial loading with 150 N), range of motion and secondary loss of reduction (dynamic 150 N axial loading over 5000 cycles). Stiffness and range of motion were measured both pre- and post-cycling. Results: The polyaxial constructs were significantly stiffer, both before and after cyclic testing. However, the two-column plates showed a significant loss of stiffness during cyclic testing. The range of motion was significantly greater, both initially and at the end of cyclic testing, in the fixed-angle constructs. The conventional constructs had significantly greater secondary loss of reduction. Conclusion: The polyaxial two-column plate tested in this study provides a biomechanically sound construct for the management of intra-articular fractures of the distal radius.

Outcomes of Ankle Fractures in Patients with Uncomplicated Versus Complicated Diabetes	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Diabetes; Ankle; Fractrures; Complications; Neuropathy	OPERATIVE TREATMENT; INTERNAL-FIXATION; GLYCEMIC CONTROL; OPEN REDUCTION; RISK-FACTORS; FOOT; MANAGEMENT; SURGERY; INFECTION; MELLITUS	Background: Patients with diabetes who sustain an ankle fracture are at increased risk for complications including higher rates of in hospital mortality, in-hospital postoperative complications, length of stay and non-routine discharges. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively compare the complications associated with operatively treated ankle fractures in a group of patients with uncomplicated diabetes versus a group of patients with complicated diabetes. Complicated diabetes was defined as diabetes associated with end organ damage such as peripheral neuropathy, nephropathy and/or PAD. Uncomplicated diabetes was defined as diabetes without any of these associated conditions. Our hypothesis was that patients with uncomplicated diabetes would experience fewer complications than those patients with complicated diabetes. Materials and Methods: We compared the complication rates of ankle fracture repair in 46 patients with complicated diabetes and 59 patients with uncomplicated diabetes and calculated odds ratios (OR) for significant findings. Results: At a mean followup of 21.4 months we found that patients with complicated diabetes had 3.8 times increased risk of overall complications 3.4 times increased risk of a non-infectious complication (malunion, nonunion or Charcot arthropathy) and 5 times higher likelihood of needing revision surgery/arthrodesis when compared to patients with uncomplicated diabetes. Open ankle fractures in this diabetic population were associated with a three times higher rate of complications and 3.7 times higher rate of infection. Conclusion: Patients with complicated diabetes have an increased risk of complications after ankle fracture surgery compared to patients with uncomplicated diabetes. Careful preoperative evaluation of the neurovascular status is mandatory, since many patients with diabetes do not recognize that they have neuropathy and/or peripheral artery disease.

Methods: Twenty-eight left sawbone femurs were divided into two groups. The 14 femurs in each group were osteotomized with subcapital or transcervical fractures. The shafts of all femurs were also osteotomized, and 1 cm of the distal segmental cortex was excised. Next, all the fractures were treated with static recon nails to concomitantly stabilize both femoral neck and shaft fractures. Additionally, seven subcapital fractures and seven transcervical fractures were supplemented with one cannulated screw in front of the recon nails. All specimens were tested with a Material Testing System machine to investigate the relative stability during uniaxial cyclic compression. Findings: The subcapital and transcervical fractures supplemented with one cannulated screw could bear more loads than those without screw supplementation (P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively at any testing interval). Moreover, in the case of the subcapital fractures, the single supplemented cannulated screw could reduce the displacement at 500 N by 24% (P < 0.001). On the other hand, in the case of the transcervical fractures, one supplemented cannulated screw could reduce the displacement at 500 N by 4% (P = 0.003). Interpretation: From the biomechanical viewpoint, the subcapital fractures in combined fractures are recommended to supplement with one cannulated screw in front of the recon nails to eliminate complications associated with stabilization.

Pyrosequencing analysis of endosymbiont population structure: co-occurrence of divergent symbiont lineages in a single vesicomyid host clam	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							16S RIBOSOMAL-RNA; DEEP-SEA; BACTERIAL SYMBIONTS; HYDROTHERMAL VENT; CALYPTOGENA-MAGNIFICA; COLD SEEPS; GENOME; EVOLUTION; BATHYMODIOLUS; DNA	P>Bacteria-eukaryote endosymbioses are perhaps the most pervasive co-evolutionary associations in nature. Here, intracellular chemosynthetic symbionts of deep-sea clams (Vesicomyidae) were analysed by amplicon pyrosequencing to explore how symbiont transmission mode affects the genetic diversity of the within-host symbiont population. Vesicomyid symbionts (Gammaproteobacteria) are presumed to be obligately intracellular, to undergo nearly strict vertical transmission between host generations, and to be clonal within a host. However, recent data show that vesicomyid symbionts can be acquired laterally via horizontal transfer between hosts or uptake from the environment, potentially creating opportunities for multiple symbiont strains to occupy the same host. Here, genotype-specific PCR and direct sequencing of the bacterial internal transcribed spacer initially demonstrated the co-occurrence of two symbiont strains, symA and symB (93.5% nt identity), in 8 of 118 Vesicomya sp. clams from 3 of 7 hydrothermal vent sites on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. To confirm multiple strains within individual clams, amplicon pyrosequencing of two symbiont loci was used to obtain deep-coverage measurements (mean: similar to 1500x coverage per locus per clam) of symbiont population structure. Pyrosequencing confirmed symA-symB co-occurrence for two individuals, showing the presence of both genotypes in amplicon pools. However, in the majority of clams, the endosymbiont population was remarkably homogenous, with > 99.5% of sequences collapsing into a single symbiont genotype in each clam. These results support the hypothesis that a predominantly vertical transmission strategy leads to the fixation of a single symbiont strain in most hosts. However, mixed symbiont populations do occur in vesicomyids, potentially facilitating the exchange of genetic material between divergent symbiont lineages.

Materials and Methods: Nineteen ankles in 19 patients were fused using CEF. All patients had approximately 3 (range, 1 to 5) operations for bone and soft tissue reconstruction preceding the arthrodesis. Ankle arthrodesis was performed an average of 2.3 (range, I to 7) years after the initial trauma. The mean age at operation was 22 (range, 20 to 31) years old and all patients were male. Results: The average time spent in the CEF was 3.5 (range, 2 to 7) months. The mean followup was 59 (range, 31 to 90) months. Successful arthrodesis was achieved in all patients in an acceptable position. Clinically, 6 patients were assessed as excellent, 9 patients as good, 3 patients as fair, and I patient had a poor result. Twelve patients reported no pain postoperatively, 4 patients reported reduced to mild and/or occasional pain, 2 patients reported moderate pain, and 1 patient reported persistent pain. Sixteen patients described their outcome as satisfactory, one was somewhat satisfied, and two were dissatisfied. There were pin track infections in 10 patients and ring sequestration in one patient. Conclusion: Patients who have degenerative ankle arthritis due to gunshot wounds and landmine injuries with poor bone quality and soft tissue conditions at the distal tibia can be successfully managed by using CEF.

The intramedullary skeletal kinetic distractor (ISKD) is a new internal, mechanically activated implant, which distracts by mild rotations of 3degrees. Material and methods: In a prospective clinical study, four patients with an mean age of 29 years (18-36 years) underwent intramedullary lengthening via ISKD. The average lengthening of three femora and one tibia was 31 mm (26-40 mm). Results: All patients performed the rotations for the distraction themselves without any significant problems. One patient took mild analgesics during the first days of distraction, whereas three patients did not require any analgesics. The average patient discharge occurred 10 days (8-11 days) postoperatively with no complications during the hospital stay. The planned length of distraction was achieved in all patients with normal alignment and normal joint orientation. Full weight bearing was performed on average after 10 weeks (7-14 weeks). Consolidation was noted 80 days (51-111 days) postoperatively with an average consolidation index of 2.9 days/mm. No complications were observed during the follow-up period of 14 months. The Enneking score was 26.8 points, and according to the classification of Paley all patients had an excellent result. Conclusions: From these preliminary results we conclude that the comfort of limb lengthening with the ISKD is increased by the elimination of fixator-associated complications and by the simple distraction mechanism, which is well tolerated by the patients. Further advantages of the ISKD are early full weight bearing and excellent limb function.

Materials and MethodsTwenty five milliunits elastase and inactivated elastase were, respectively, injected into the cerebellomedullary cistern of 60 C57/BL6 mice which were divided into experimental group (EG, n = 30) and control group (CG, n = 30) by using a computer-based random order generator. The modified modeling protocol clarified these aspects including brain three-dimensional parameters of mouse head fixation, angle of head inclination, fixed position of taper ear, needle holding technique, needle entry depth, prevention of liquid drug back flow, and storage conditions of elastase. And it was observed for the following parts such as mortality, inflammatory factors, craniocerebral arteries scanning, vascular tortuosity index, artery diameter, pathology of the cerebrovascular. ResultsWithin differently surveyed stage, the total mortality of mice in EG was 20%. ELISA illustrated that the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in peripheral blood were increased significantly after modeling. Angiography indicated that 100% of IADE in EG were observed and the diameter and tortuosity index of the basilar artery were significantly increased (P < 0.01). EVG histological processing and staining showed the disrupted internal elastic lamina, the atrophied muscle layer, and the hyalinized connective tissue of the basilar artery with the vascular wall tunica media in EG. Micro-computed tomography reported that the craniocerebral arteries of the mice in EG were outstandingly elongated, tortuous, and dilated. ConclusionThe modified modeling protocol can reduce the mortality, improve the success rate, and provide a stable animal model for IADE.				zhangdaopei89@163.com		zhang, ZhenQiang/0000-0002-1736-1289	Special Project for Scientific Research of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Henan Province [2019ZY1013, 2019JDZX2101, 2019JDZX2032]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [81573874]; Leading Talent Project of Henan Chinese Medicine Department [8]	Special Project for Scientific Research of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Henan Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Leading Talent Project of Henan Chinese Medicine Department	Funding The Special Project for Scientific Research of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Henan Province (Grant Nos. 2019ZY1013, 2019JDZX2101, and 2019JDZX2032), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 81573874), and Leading Talent Project of Henan Chinese Medicine Department (Yu Wei Zhong Yi Han [2021] No. 8) provided financial support for the conduct of the research.		29	3	4	1	7	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND	1664-2295			FRONT NEUROL	Front.

A 10-Year Retrospective Study of 490 Hip Fracture Patients: Reoperations, Direct Medical Costs, and Survival	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article						Hip fracture; complication; reoperation; costs; survival	FEMORAL-NECK; DISPLACED FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; SURGICAL APPROACH; MORTALITY; HEMIARTHROPLASTIES; DISLOCATION; SERVICES; SURGERY	Background and Aims: Reoperations after operative treatment of hip fracture patients may be associated with higher costs and inferior survival. We examined the acute hospital costs, long-term reoperation rates, and survival of patients with a new hip fracture. Materials and Methods: A total of 490 consecutive new hip fracture patients treated at a single center between 31 December 2004 and 6 December 2006 were analyzed retrospectively. Fractures were classified according to Garden and AO. All medical records were checked manually. The costs of reoperations were calculated using the diagnosis-related groups (DRG)-based prices. Survival analysis was performed using the life-table method. The follow-up time was 10 years. Results: In all, 70/490 patients (14.3%) needed reoperations. Of all reoperations, 34.2% were performed during the first month and 72.9% within 1 year after the primary operation. The hemiarthroplasty dislocation rate was 8.5%, and mechanical failures of osteosynthesis occurred in 6.2%. Alcohol abuse was associated with a heightened risk of reoperation. The mean direct costs of primary fracture care were lower than the mean costs of reoperations (euro7500 vs euro9800). The mortality rate at 10 years was 79.8% among non-reoperated patients and 62.9% among reoperated patients. Conclusions: According to our hypothesis, the cost per patient of reoperation in acute care was 31% higher than the corresponding cost of a primary operation. Reoperations increased the overall immediate costs of index fractures by nearly 20%. One-third of all reoperations were performed during the first month and almost 75% within 1 year after the primary operation.

Materials and methods All data were collected from the Chinese National Medical Data Centre database, which contained the hospitalisation data of 73 tertiary hospitals from 24 provinces. The included patients were first hospitalised with the main diagnosis of femoral neck or intertrochanteric fracture, and were discharged between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2015. Secondary hospitalisation, multiple trauma or pathologic fracture (except for osteoporotic fracture) patients or patients with missing data were excluded. The impact of various factors on the cost was investigated using analysis of variance and multivariable linear regression analysis. The Gross Domestic Product per capita and average annual disposable income were obtained from the website of the National Bureau of Statistics. Results 27 205 cases were included in the study. The mean cost of all patients was (sic)53 440. 60-69 years age group had a significantly higher cost compared with 80 years and above age group. The mean cost of femoral neck fractures was lower than that of the patients with intertrochanteric fractures; the mean cost of hip replacement was higher than that of internal fixation, which showed a strong effect of the surgical approach to the cost. Patients in low-income provinces spent less than those in high-income provinces, while the gap between high-income and middle-income provinces were relatively small. Conclusion The hospitalisation cost of hip fracture has become a great burden to the patients' families. The Chinese medical insurance policy may need further consideration of the demographic and economic factors.

Materials and methods: Coronal CT images of hips in 50 randomly selected healthy cases were analysed using a unique measurement method with respect to the height, diameter, bending angle and inclination angle of lateral cortex of proximal femur. The data were then compared with dimensions of PFNA and PFNA-II. Results: The average height of proximal femur was 61.1 +/- 5.2 mm, diameter 18.1 +/- 1.5 mm, bending angle 8.4 +/- 2.2 degrees and inclination angle of lateral cortex 11.9 +/- 1.1 degrees. The average impingement length of the lateral cortex was 54.2 +/- 4.7 mm (range 41.4-64.2 mm), which was shorter than the height of the proximal femur. On comparison with dimensions of PFNA and PFNA-II, the lateral inclination angle and impingement length were found to be discrepant in PFNA; however, in the latter the. at lateral surface helps avoiding impingement with the lateral femoral cortex. Conclusion: Our study provides clear evidence that the. at lateral shape of PFNA-II is better suited for the femur of Asian patients by reducing the chances of impingement with the lateral proximal femoral cortex during intra-operative reduction in subtrochanteric fractures.

J	Stella, JA; Sacks, MS				Stella, John A.; Sacks, Michael S.			On the biaxial mechanical properties of the layers of the aortic valve leaflet	JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article							INTERNAL SHEAR PROPERTIES; GLUTARALDEHYDE FIXATION; VENTRICULARIS; STRETCH; FIBROSA	All existing constitutive models for heart valve leaflet tissues either assume a uniform transmural stress distribution or utilize a membrane tension formulation. Both approaches ignore layer specific mechanical contributions and the implicit nonuniformity of the transmural stress distribution. To begin to address these limitations, we conducted novel studies to quantify the biaxial mechanical behavior of the two structurally distinct, load bearing aortic valve (AV) leaflet layers: the fibrosa and ventricularis. Strip biaxial tests, with extremely sensitive force sensing capabilities, were further utilized to determine the mechanical behavior of the separated ventricularis layer at very low stress levels. Results indicated that both layers exhibited very different nonlinear highly anisotropic mechanical behaviors. While the leaflet tissue mechanical response was dominated by the fibrosa layer, the ventricularis contributed double the amount of the fibrosa to the total radial tension and experienced four times the stress level. The strip biaxial test results further indicated that the ventricularis exhibited substantial anisotropic mechanical properties at very low stress levels. This result suggested that for all strain levels, the ventricularis layer is dominated by circumferentially oriented collagen fibers, and the initial loading phase of this layer cannot be modeled as an isotropic material. Histological-based thickness measurements indicated that the fibrosa and ventricularis constitute 41% and 29% of the total layer thickness, respectively. Moreover the extensive network of interlayer connections and identical strains under biaxial loading in the intact state suggests that these layers are tightly bonded. In addition to advancing our knowledge of the subtle but important mechanical properties of the AV leaflet, this study provided a comprehensive database required for the development of a true 3D stress constitutive model for the native AV leaflet.

We also tested a hypothesis that the effect of photofunctionalization is as substantial as the one of surface roughening. Two different surface morphology, a roughened surface (sandblasted and acid-etched surface) and relatively smooth surface (machined surface), was tested. Ti6Al4V samples were photofunctionalized withUV light for 15min using a photo device. Photofunctionalization converted Ti6Al4V surfaces from hydrophobic to superhydrophilic. The attachment, spread, proliferation, and the expression of functional phenotype of bone marrow-derived osteoblasts were promoted on photofunctionalized Ti6Al4V surfaces. The strength of bone-implant integration examined using a biomechanical push-in test in a rat femur model was at least 100% greater for photofunctionalized implants than for untreated implants. These effects were seen on both surface types. The strength of bone-implant integration for photofunctionalizedmachined implants was greater than that for untreated roughened implants, indicating that the impact of photofunctionalization may be greater than that of surface roughening. Newly prepared Ti alloy was hydrophilic, whereas the hydrophilic status degraded with time and was converted to hydrophobic in 4 weeks. This finding uncovered biological aging of Ti alloy and allowed us to consider photofunctionalization as a countermeasure for aging. These results suggest that photofunctionalization accelerates and enhances bone-implant integration of Ti6Al4V regardless of smooth and roughened surface features, supporting photofunctionalization as an effective and viable measure for improving efficacy of a wide range of Ti6Al4V-based materials used in dental and orthopedic medicine.

Little is known about Listeria monocytogenes-associated bone and joint infections. Only case reports of this infection have been published. Methods. Retrospective study of culture-proven bone and joint cases reported to the French National Reference Center for Listeria from 1992 to 2010. Results. Forty-three patients were studied: 61% were men, and the median age was 72 (range, 16-89); 24 patients exhibited comorbidities (56%). Thirty-six patients (84%) had orthopedic implant devices: prosthetic joints (n = 34) or internal fixation (n = 2); the median time after insertion was 9 years (0.1-22). Subacute infection was more frequent (median, 4 weeks [range, 2-100], 74%) than acute infection (< 7 days, 23%), with nonspecific clinical features; 45% of patients had no fever. Blood cultures were positive in 3 of 19 cases. Isolate polymerase chain reaction genogrouping revealed 4 patterns: IVb (21 of 42, 50%), IIa (17 of 42, 40%), IIb (2 of 42, 5%), and IIc (2 of 42, 5%). Five groups of strains with similar pulsotype patterns were identified without an epidemiological link. Antibiotics, primarily amoxicillin (80%) with aminoglycosides (48%), were prescribed for a median duration of 15 weeks (range, 2-88). Eighteen patients (50%) underwent prosthesis replacement; all were successful after median follow-up of 10 months (range, 1-75). Five of 13 patients for whom material was not removed had protracted infection despite prolonged antibiotherapy; 3 of these patients later underwent prosthesis replacement with sustained recovery. Conclusions. Osteoarticular listeriosis primarily involves prosthetic joints and occurs in immunocompromised patients. It requires intensive treatment with antibiotherapy and usually requires implant removal or replacement for cure.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of cefazolin prophylaxis on the surgical site infection. Materials and Methods: Total 298 patients with implants removal surgeries had subjected to randomize into two groups of 149 each. Patients had received bolus 1 g of cefazolin (CN group) or normal saline (NS group) before surgeries. The incidences of deep and superficial surgical site infection, health-related quality of life, functional outcome, visual analog scale, clinical and bacteriological assessments within 1 month after surgery were evaluated. Mann-Whitney test following Turkey post hoc tests were used for the surgical site infection at 95% of confidence level. Results: CN and NS groups had reported 19 (13%) and 21 (14%) superficial surgical site infection and 2 (1%) and 8 (5%) deep surgical site infection within 1 month, respectively. Both groups did not show a significant improvement in health-related quality of life, functional outcome and pain during 1 month. There were 12 (67%) microorganisms' species found sensitive and 6 (33%) found not sensitive to cefazolin in bacteriological assessments. Conclusion: Single dose of 1 g of cefazolin prophylaxis reduced numbers of patients with the surgical site infection.

To demonstrate the bone forming capacity of nHAP-PLGA-collagen prior to in vivo experiments, nHAP-PLGA-collagen films and 3D porous scaffolds were seeded with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) to characterize cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. Over 21 days hMSCs seeded on 2D nHAP-PLGA-collagen films proliferate, form nodules, deposit mineral and express high alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) indicating commitment of hMSCs towards osteogenic lineage. When seeded in 3D scaffolds, hMSCs migrate throughout the connected porous network of the nHAP-PLGA-collagen scaffold and proliferate to fill the scaffold voids. Over 35 days, cells express ALP, osteocalcin and deposit minerals with kinetics similar to osteogenesis in vivo. Adipogenic or chondrogenic differentiation is not detected in 3D constructs, indicating that in an osteogenic environment the presence of bone ECM specific molecules in nHAP-PLGA-collagen scaffolds support homogeneous bone tissue development. This ability of nHAP-PLGA-collagen matrices to provide biochemical stimulation to support osteogenesis from stem cells along with its high mechanical strength suggests that nHAP-PLGA-collagen is a suitable biomaterial for bone regeneration. This platform technology of covalently attaching ECM proteins and molecules with synthetic and natural polymers to adjust material properties and biochemical signaling has a potential for a wider range of applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

HMC receives poor reimbursement for these services, creating a disproportionate financial burden on the hospital. In this study we aim to identify the variables associated with increased cost of care, measure the relative financial impact of these variables, and quantify the revenue loss incurred from the treatment of isolated mandibular fractures. Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients treated at HMC for isolated mandibular fractures from July 1999 through June 2010, using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Current Procedural Terminology coding. Data collected included demographics, injury, hospital course, treatment, outcomes, and billing. Results: The study included 1,554 patients. Total billing was $22.1 million. Of this, $6.9 million was recovered. We found that there are multiple variables associated with the increased cost of treating mandibular fractures; 4 variables-length of hospital stay, treatment modality, service providing treatment, and method of arrival-accounted for 49.1% of the total variance in the amount billed. In addition, we found that the unsponsored portion of our patient population grew from 6.7% to 51.4% during the study period. Conclusions: Our results led to specific cost-efficiency recommendations: 1) perform closed reduction whenever possible; 2) encourage performing procedures with patients under local anesthesia (closed reductions and arch bar removals); 3) provide improved and shared training among the services treating craniofacial trauma; 4) encourage arrival by privately owned vehicle; 5) provide outpatient treatment, when applicable; 6) offer provider incentives to take trauma call; and 7) offer hospital incentives to treat patients and not transfer them.

Subtalar stabilization of pes equinovaigus by conventional open surgery using bicortical iliac crest bone graft (mid-term results)	ACTA CHIRURGIAE ORTHOPAEDICAE ET TRAUMATOLOGIAE CECHOSLOVACA			English	Article						cerebral palsy; pes equinovalgus; subtalar extra-articular arthrodesis	INTERNAL-FIXATION; CEREBRAL-PALSY; ARTHRODESIS; VALGUS; DEFORMITIES; CHILDREN	PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The aim of the study was to analyze the results of subtalar stabilization of the foot by conventional open surgery with the use of bicortical graft in cerebral palsy patients with pes equinovalgus and to compare our results with those of other authors. MATERIAL A total of 193 operations were performed, with bilateral surgery in 84, surgery on the right foot in nine and surgery on the left foot in 16 patients. The average follow-up was 5 years and 2 months. METHODS Before and after surgery, the clinical presentation in each patient was evaluated according to our subjective, description-based classification using a I-to-III scale (I, normal foot; II, moderate deformity; III, severe deformity). On lateral radiographs of the foot in a standing position, the talocalcaneal (TC) angle and that between the longitudinal calcaneus axis and foot-supporting surface (CS) were measured. The data was analyzed by statistical methods. RESULTS The pre-operative findings were compared with the post-operative ones on the basis of our I-III classification system. In all results obtained with the McNemar test, p-values were lower than 0.001; therefore, at a 5 % level, the null hypothesis can be ruled out and a conclusion can be drawn that this surgery has an effect on the change in foot shape, as defined by our classification. Surgery failed in 13 feet (6.7 %), i.e., it did not produce any change in the degree of deformity. Similarly, values of the TC and CS angles were compared. The null hypothesis of Wilcoxon's test is that the patient's condition (TC and CP angles) remains the same before and after surgery. In all cases, the p-values were lower than 0.001; therefore, at a 5 % level, the null hypothesis can be ruled out, with the conclusion that differences between pre- and postoperative conditions were statistically significant. DISCUSSION The results of this study, as compared with the relevant data, show that, for correction of pes equinovalgus, subtalar stabilization with bicortical iliac crest graft is a sufficiently reliable method even without metal fixation. The failure rate is only 6.7 %. CONCLUSIONS The method described here achieves good results, the validity of which is supported by statistical analysis.

Materials & Methods: A total of 37 patients with unilateral calcaneal fractures were randomly divided into two groups as a conventional surgery group (n: 19) and a 3D model-assisted surgery group (n: 18). The preoperative, postoperative and last follow up angles of the Bohler and Gissane, calcaneal width and facet height were measured. The duration of the operation, blood loss volume, fluoroscopy usage, instrumentation time for both groups were recorded. Finally, the follow-up AOFAS scores were evaluated. A questionnaire was used to determine the perceptions of the resident doctors about the 3D model. Results: The duration of the operation, blood loss volume, fluoroscopy usage, instrumentation time for 3D model-assisted surgery group were 83.3 +/- 4.6 minutes, 83.6 +/- 4.6 ml, 6.8 +/- 1.4 times and 13.0 +/- 0.8 weeks, and as for conventional group they were 130.0 +/- 5.8 minutes, 105.1 +/- 5.6 minutes, 11.7 +/- 1.5 ml, 22.2 +/- 2.4 times and 13.3 +/- 0.8 weeks, respectively (p < 0.0001). The both groups significantly restored Bohler angle, Gissane angle, calcaneal width and calcaneal facet height after operation (p < 0.0 001). The 3D model-assisted group was significantly more succesful in restoration and protection of achieved correction of calcanel facet height (p < 0.0001). The difference was determined among the groups at the final follow-up examination with respect to the amount of change according the values achieved postop. were significant in Bohler angle (p < 0.001), calcaneal facet height (p < 0.0001) and calcaneal widht (p = 0.017). There was no significant difference between AOFAS scores of the two groups at last follow-up. Resident doctors exhibited high scores of overall satisfaction with the use of a 3D printing model. Conclusions: Compared to the conventional group, the 3D model-assisted group provide successful intervention and reduce operation, instrumentation time and the fluoroscopy usage with less blood loss. Performing 3D-assisted surgery helps the quality of reduction during the surgery and stability of internal fixation to protect achieved reduction at follow-up more succesfully. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the clinical outcomes following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) surgery are generally good, 2 major complications are graft migration and nonunion. These complications have led some to advocate rigid internal fixation and/or cervical immobilization postoperatively. This paper examines a single-surgeon experience with single-level ACDF without use of plates or hard collars in patients with degenerative spondylosis in whom allograft was used as the fusion material. Methods. The authors conducted a retrospective review of a prospective database of (Cloward-type) ACDF operations performed by the senior author (J.A.J.) between July 1996 and June 2005. Radiographic follow-up included static and flexion/extension radiographs obtained to assess fusion, focal and segmental kyphosis, and change in disc space height. At most recent follow-up, the patients' condition was evaluated by an independent physician examiner. The Odom criteria and Neck Disability Index (NDI) were used to assess outcome. Results. One hundred seventy patients underwent single-level ACDF for degenerative pathology during the study period. Their most common presenting symptoms were pain, weakness, and radiculopathy; 88% of patients noted : 2 neurological complaints. The mean hospital stay was 1.76 days (range 0-36 days), and 3 patients (2%) had major immediate postoperative complications requiring reoperation. The mean duration of follow-up was 22 months (range 12-124 months). Radiographic evidence of fusion was present in 160 patients (94%). Seven patients (4%) showed radiographic evidence of pseudarthrosis, and graft migration was seen in 3 patients (2%). All patients had increases in focal kyphosis at the operated level on postoperative radiographs (mean -7.4'), although segmental alignment was preserved in 133 patients (78%). Mean change in disc space height was 36.5% (range 28-53%). At m ost recent clinical follow-up, 122 patients (72%) had no complaints referable to cervical disease and were able to carry out their activities of daily living without impairment. The mean postoperative NDI score was 3.2 (median 3, range 0-3 1). Conclusions. Single-level ACDF without intraoperative plate placement or the use of a postoperative collar is an effective treatment for cervical spondylosis. Although there is evidence of focal kyphosis and loss of disc space height, radiographic evidence of fusion is comparable to that attained with plate fixation, and the rate of clinical improvement is high.

The goal of this IBRA symposium and this paper was to evaluate current trends and potential changes of treatment strategies for mandibular condylar fractures, which remain controversial over the past decades. Methods: Using a cross-sectional study design, we enrolled the consensus based on the panel of experts and participants in the IBRA Symposium 2012. The outcomes of interest were the panel and electronic votes on management of condylar base, neck and head fractures, and panel votes on endoscopic and paediatric condylar fractures. Appropriate descriptive and univariate statistics were used. Results: The consensus derived from 14 experts and 41 participant surgeons, using 12 case scenarios and 27 statements. The experts and participants had similar decision on the treatment of condylar base, neck and head fractures, as well as similar opinion on complications of condylar fracture osteosynthesis. They had a parallel agreement on using open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) as treatment of choice for condylar base and neck fractures in adults. Endoscopic approaches should be considered for selected cases, such as condylar base fractures with lateral displacement. There was also a growing tendency to perform ORIF in condylar head fractures. The experts also agreed to treat children (> 12 years old) in the same way as adults and to consider open reduction in severely displaced and dislocated fractures even in younger children. Nevertheless, non-surgical treatment should be the first choice for children <6 years of age. The decision to perform surgery in children was based on factors influencing facial growth, appropriate age for ORIF, and disagreement to use resorbable materials in children. Conclusions: The experts and participating surgeons had comparable opinion on management of condylar fractures and complications of ORIF. Compared to the first Condylar Fracture Symposium 2007 in Strasbourg, ORIF may now be considered as the gold standard for both condylar base and neck fractures with displacement and dislocation. Although ORIF in condylar head fractures in adults and condylar fractures in children with mixed dentition is highly recommended, but this recommendation requires further investigations.

Materials and Methods: 29 elderly patients of 60 years and above sustaining fresh subcapital femoral neck fracture underwent total hip arthroplasty (group I, n=14) and modified Pauwels intertrochanteric osteotomy (group II, n=15). Functions were evaluated using modified Harris hip score, dAubigne and postel criteria and SF-36 score at 6, 12, 52 and 100 weeks. Results: The fracture union in group II was achieved in 14 (93.3) patients at the fracture site at an average of 15 weeks and osteotomy united in all patients. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head was observed in one patient (6.7). Average operative time was 88.9 and 65.6 minutes in group I and II, respectively (P value = 0.00001). An average of 0.8 and 0.2 unit blood was transfused in patients in group I and II, respectively (P value = 0.001). Average time of full weight bearing was 6.1 weeks and 11.6 weeks in group I and group II, respectively. At 100 weeks 71.4 (n = 10) patients in group I and 80 (n = 12) patients in group II showed good to excellent results on the basis of modified Harris hip score. 71.4 (n = 10) patients in group I and 66.6 (n = 10) patients in group II showed good to excellent results on the basis of dAubigne criteria. Average SF-36 score was 17.2 in group I and 17.6 in group II. Revision osteotomy was performed in one patient in group II because of implant cut through. Another patient in group II underwent THR because of painful hip. One patient in group I presented with dislocation after 3 weeks of surgery. Conclusion: Functional results of total hip arthroplasty and intertrochanteric osteotomy are comparable and the valgus intertrochanteric osteotomy with osteosynthesis in subcapital femoral neck fractures in elderly patients of sixty years and above may be considered as an option.

We therefore conducted a retrospective study of centenarians with PFFs both to assess: (1) assess clinical outcomes according to geriatric and trauma scores, (2) and to determine whether routine surgery is warranted. Hypothesis: Morbidity and mortality in a single-centre cohort of centenarians with surgically treated PFFs are consistent with previous reports. Material and method: We retrospectively reviewed the data of 33 women and 6 men aged 100 years or over who were treated surgically for PFFs at a single-centre between 2008 and 2014. Of the 39 patients, 15 were living at home and 24 in an institution at the time of the injury. Mean (range) values were 3.30 (0-7) for the Parker Mobility Score, 5.84 (0-12) for the Katz index, and 7.46 (2-12) for the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). Mean time from injury to surgery was 1.7 days (0-12). The 26 extra-capsular fractures were managed by internal fixation and the 13 intra-capsular fractures by hip arthroplasty (n = 12) or screw fixation (n=1). Results: After a mean follow-up of 23 + 14 months (6-60 months), 29 patients had died, including 3 within 48 h, 10 within 3 months, and 15 within 1 year. Sequential mortality rates were 33.3% within the first 3 months, 26.9% from months 4 to 9, and 42.2% within the first year. Early dislocation occurred in 3 patients and surgical-site infection in 2 patients. Other complications were heart failure (n=1), confusional state (n=2), pneumonia (n=2), and pyelonephritis (n=2). Discussion: A PubMed search identified five studies of PFFs in more than 10 centenarians, of which only 2 provided detailed information on postoperative general and local morbidity related to the surgical treatment. Our hypothesis was confirmed for 3-month and 1-year mortality rates, which were at the lower ends of previously reported ranges. Local complications related directly to surgery were considerably more common in our study. PFFs in centenarians carry a high risk of death. Despite the absence of a control group, our data support surgery as the best treatment option. Level of evidence: IV, retrospective study. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

A large number of people worldwide suffer from pain caused by osteoporotic fractures every year, which can even cause disability and death. The compromised skeletal strength, lower density, trabecular microstructure, and bone-forming ability caused by osteoporotic fractures make them difficult to treat relative to normal fractures. An ideal scheme for osteoporotic fractures is to select internal fixation materials with matched mechanical and biological properties and carry anti-osteoporosis drugs on the plant to achieve bio-fixation and improve the condition of osteoporosis simultaneously. We designed a Mg-based MAO-MT-PLGA drug/ion delivery system (DDS) compatible with bone-like mechanical properties, degradation properties, and drug therapy. In this research, we evaluated the degradation behavior of Mg-based MAO-MT-PLGA DDS using immersion tests and electrochemical tests aided by SEM, EDS, XPS, XRD, and FT-IR. The DDS showed better corrosion resistance over Mg alloy and could release more Mg2+ due to the degradation of PLGA. According to cell viability and cell adhesion, the DDS showed better osteogenic characteristics over control group I (Mg alloy) and control group II (Mg-based MAO alloy), especially in the cells co-cultured with the leaching solution for 72 h, in which the DDS group increased to about 15% cell viability compared with group I (p < 0.05). The mRNA relative expressions, including ALP, collagen I, OCN, OPG, and Runx-2, as well as extracellular matrix calcium deposits of the DDS, are 1.5--2 times over control group I and control group II (p < 0.05), demonstrating a better ability to promote bone formation and inhibit bone resorption. After the DDS was implanted into the castrated rat model for one month, the trabeculae in the treatment group were significantly denser and stronger than those in the control group, with a difference of about 1.5 times in bone volume fraction, bone density, and the number of trabeculae, as well as the magnesium content in the bone tissue (p < 0.05). The above results demonstrated that the Mg-based MAO-MT-PLGA drug/ion delivery system is a potential treatment for osteoporotic fractures.

The aim of the present study was to compare the soft tissue biocompatibility of MgCa0.8 and commonly used surgical steel in vivo. Methods: A biodegradable magnesium calcium alloy (MgCa0.8) and surgical steel (S316L), as a control, were investigated. Screws of identical geometrical conformation were implanted into the tibiae of 40 rabbits for a postoperative follow up of two, four, six and eight weeks. The tibialis cranialis muscle was in direct vicinity of the screw head and thus embedded in paraffin and histologically and immunohistochemically assessed. Haematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to identify macrophages, giant cells and heterophil granulocytes as well as the extent of tissue fibrosis and necrosis. Mouse anti-CD79 alpha and rat anti-CD3 monoclonal primary antibodies were used for B-and T-lymphocyte detection. Evaluation of all sections was performed by applying a semi-quantitative score. Results: Clinically, both implant materials were tolerated well. Histology revealed that a layer of fibrous tissue had formed between implant and overlying muscle in MgCa0.8 and S316L, which was demarcated by a layer of synoviocyte-like cells at its interface to the implant. In MgCa0.8 implants cavities were detected within the fibrous tissue, which were surrounded by the same kind of cell type. The thickness of the fibrous layer and the amount of tissue necrosis and cellular infiltrations gradually decreased in S316L. In contrast, a decrease could only be noted in the first weeks of implantation in MgCa0.8, whereas parameters were increasing again at the end of the observation period. B-lymphocytes were found more often in MgCa0.8 indicating humoral immunity and the presence of soluble antigens. Conversely, S316L displayed a higher quantity of T-lymphocytes. Conclusions: Moderate inflammation was detected in both implant materials and resolved to a minimum during the first weeks indicating comparable biocompatibility for MgCa0.8 and S316L. Thus, the application of MgCa0.8 as biodegradable implant material seems conceivable. Since the inflammatory parameters were re-increasing at the end of the observation period in MgCa0.8 it is important to observe the development of inflammation over a longer time period in addition to the present study.

The influence of the hips position on measurements of posterior tilt in a valgus-impacted femoral neck fracture	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Femoral neck fracture; Undisplaced; Garden I and II; Posterior tilt; Three-dimensional; Lateral radiograph; X-ray	INTERNAL-FIXATION; GARDEN-I; FAILURE; REOPERATION; RELIABILITY; RISK	Introduction: Lateral radiographs are important for the evaluation of Garden I and II femoral neck fractures. These fractures appear undisplaced in the anteroposterior view, but posterior tilt of the femoral head may still be present in the lateral view. The influence of posterior tilt is, however, debated, which could be caused by the use of non-standardized cross-table radiographs in the conflicting reports. The aim of this bone-model study was therefore to evaluate the influence of the hips position on measurements of posterior tilt. Materials and methods: We generated models of a Garden I-II femoral neck fracture and the non-injured contralateral femur from CT reconstructions with a 3D-printer. Lateral radiographs of the models were obtained in positions ranging from 90 degrees internal rotation (IR) to 90 degrees external rotation (ER) and 0-80 degrees flexion. Two investigators independently measured posterior tilt on 27 lateral radiographs obtained from each model. Results: The inter-tester ICC was 0.91 (0.84-0.94), standard error of measurement (SEM) 2.6, and minimal detectable change (MDC) 7.2. The median (range) posterior tilt for the fracture model was 21.9 degrees (5.0, 33.8) and 23.6 degrees (2.2, 28.6) for observer 1 and observer 2, respectively. The corresponding posterior tilt within the range of 10 degrees IR to 40 degrees ER and 0 to 30 degrees flexion of the fracture model, was 27.3 degrees (24.0, 33.8) and 26.3 degrees (24.8, 28.6). Discussion: The range of posterior tilt measurements for positions of the proximal femur restricted from 10 degrees IR to 40 degrees ER and 0 to 30 degrees flexion, was above the MDC for observer 1, and below the MDC for observer 2. These findings indicate that rotation and flexion affect measurements of posterior tilt, but the influence may be negligible for positions of the injured extremity that are clinically relevant during cross-table lateral radiographs. A larger study that accounts for variations in anatomy and fracture displacement is required to confirm these findings. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: A retrospective review of paediatric patients who underwent ZMC repair with concomitant orbital floor fractures with bioresorbable implants in Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital from July 2015 to June 2019 was performed. The primary outcome measures included ocular motility, diplopia, enophthalmos, facial deformities, and restricted mouth opening, as well as complication rates. Pre- and post-operative computed tomography scans were obtained for clinical diagnosis and surgical effectiveness. Results: Twenty two children were included in this study. Facial deformities were corrected in all 22 cases by surgical reconstruction postoperatively, and the average relative distance of Portals point-Zygomaxillare and Anteriornasalspine-Zygomaxillare were 1.3 +/- 0.6mm (P = 0.22) and 1.2 +/- 0.5mm (P = 0.19). The eye movement restored to normal in 13 patients. The mean amount of relative enophthalmos was 1.0 +/- 0.4 mm (P = 0.12). 12 cases had complete resolution of diplopia postoperatively at the extremes of the gaze, and 1 case presented persistent diplopia on the down gaze as before, but from level III to level I. Facial numbness was resolved completely in 6 cases, and 2 cases presented with persistent numbness but relieved significantly. The average Hounsfield units of RapidSorb plates and OrbFloor PI were 154 +/- 5 and 99 +/- 4 respectively on computed tomography image obtained 1 week postoperatively, which showed no obvious difference compared with 0.5 year postoperatively (P > 0.1). Hounsfield units of implants gradually declined around 1 year postoperatively. Hounsfield units of RapidSorb plates (20 +/- 1) were consistent with periorbital tissue during postoperative 2-year follow-up, and Hounsfield units of OrbFloor PI (19 +/- 1) were consistent with periorbital tissue during postoperative 1.5-year follow-up. No patients had severe sequelae or implant related complications postoperatively. None of bone nonunion, malunion, infection or rejection occurred during the follow-up periods. Conclusions: Open reduction and internal fixation for the treatment of ZMC fracture have achieved significant improvement in functional and cosmetic outcomes postoperatively. Bioresorbable materials have been proved to be effective and safe in the treatment of children's ZMC and orbital wall fractures.

The aim of this report is to clarify the advantages and disadvantages of these surgical methods and to discuss current concepts for the surgical strategy in the treatment of craniosynostosis. Material and methods: From January 2001 to March 2003, 25 patients with craniosynostosis were examined. Among them, 7 patients, 5 with Apert syndrome, 1 with Crouzon disease, and 1 with multiple-synostosis, underwent surgical treatment using the distraction method with internal distraction devices, according to our treatment strategy for craniosynostosis. All patients underwent preoperative and postoperative evaluations, which included the patient's neurological state, developmental quotient (DQ), and three-dimensional CT (3D-CT). Results: The timing of the procedures undertaken was between the ages of 1 year 5 months and 12 years 6 months ( mean age 4 years 11 months). Five patients had received previous treatment and this procedure was used as a secondary operation. Postoperative distraction distances varied from 7 to 20.5 mm (mean distraction distance: 14 mm). Satisfactory cranial volume expansion and aesthetically pleasing morphological states were achieved in all cases. Regarding complications, one patient required re-operation because of dislocation of the device and skin erosion caused by infection around the penetrated wound. Finally, in a second patient a distortion of the device occurred, but no re-operation was needed. Conclusion: The advantage of the distraction method is its applicability for Toddler or Elder Children Calvarial Reconstruction to correct cosmetic and functional problems. One disadvantage is the difficulty in using it for Infantile Calvarial Normalization because of thin calvarial bones and the necessity for re-operation to remove the device, which may result in it becoming a "fixation procedure," essentially contraindicated for the fast-developing brain and calvarias. However, the efficacy of this procedure is that the many advantages outweigh the disadvantages as sufficient calvarial expansion and good results using the distraction method, especially in toddler and elder children age groups, can be achieved.

The treatment effects, complications, and reasons were analyzed retrospectively. Material and method: There were 54 juvenile cases under 18 years of age with thoracolumbar spinal tuberculosis. The average age was 9.2 years old, and the sample comprised 38 males and 16 females. The disease types included 28 thoracic cases, 17 thoracolumbar cases, and 9 lumbar cases. Nerve function was evaluated with the Frankel classification. Thirty-six cases were performed with focus debridement and deformity correction and were supported with allograft or autograft in mesh and fixed with pedicle screws from a posterior approach. Eight cases underwent a combined anterior and posterior surgical approach. Nine cases underwent osteotomy and deformity correction, and one case received focus debridement. The treatment effects, complications, and bone fusions were tracked for an average of 52 months. Results: According to the Frankel classification, paralysis was improved from 3 cases of B, 8 cases of C, 18 cases of D, and 25 cases of E preoperatively. This improvement was found in 3 cases of C, 6 cases of D, and 45 cases of E at a final follow-up postoperatively. No nerve dysfunction was aggravated. VAS was improved from 7.8 +/- 1.7 preoperatively to 3.2 +/- 2.1 at final follow-up postoperatively. ODI was improved from 77.5 +/- 17.3 preoperatively to 28.4 +/- 15.9 at final follow-up postoperatively. Kyphosis Cobb angle improved from 62.2 degrees +/- 3.7 degrees preoperatively to 37 degrees +/- 2.4 degrees at final follow-up postoperatively. Both of these are significant improvements, and all bone grafts were fused. Complications related to the operation occurred in 31.5 % (17/54) of cases. Six cases suffered postoperative aggravated kyphosis deformity, eight cases suffered proximal kyphosis deformity, one case suffered pedicle penetration, one case suffered failure of internal devices, and one case suffered recurrence of tuberculosis. Conclusion: As long as the treatment plan is fully prepared, the surgical option can achieve a satisfactory curative effect in treating juvenile spinal tuberculosis despite some complications.

Symptomatic herniated thoracic discs remain a surgical challenge and historically have been associated with significant complications. While neurological outcomes have improved with the abandonment of decompressive laminectomy, the attempt to minimize surgical complications and associated morbidities continues through less invasive approaches. Many of these techniques, such as thoracoscopy, have not been widely adopted due to technical difficulties. The current study was performed to examine the safety and early results of a minimally invasive lateral approach for symptomatic thoracic herniated intervertebral discs. Methods. Sixty patients from 5 institutions were treated using a mini-open lateral approach for 75 symptomatic thoracic herniated discs with or without calcification. The mean age was 57.9 years (range 23-80 years), and 53.3% of the patients were male. Treatment levels ranged from T4-5 to T11-12, with 1-3 levels being treated (mean 1.3 levels). The most common levels treated were T11-12 (14 cases [18.7%]), T7-8 (12 cases [16%]), and T8-9 (12 cases [16%]). Symptoms included myelopathy in 70% of cases, radiculopathy in 51.7%, axial back pain in 76.7%, and bladder and/or bowel dysfunction in 26.7%. Instrumentation included an interbody spacer in all but 6 cases (10%). Supplemental internal fixation included anterolateral plating in 33.3% of cases and pedicle screws in 10%; there was no supplemental internal fixation in 56.7% of cases. Follow-up ranged from 0.5 to 24 months (mean 11.0 months). Results. The median operating time, estimated blood loss, and length of stay were 182 minutes, 290 ml, and 5.0 days, respectively. Four major complications occurred (6.7%): pneumonia in 1 patient (1.7%); extrapleural free air in I patient (1.7%), treated with chest tube placement; new lower-extremity weakness in 1 patient (1.7%); and wound infection in posterior instrumentation in I patient (1.7%). Reoperations occurred in 3 cases (5%): one for posterior reexploration, one for infection in posterior instrumentation, and one for removal of symptomatic residual disc material. Back pain, measured using the visual analog scale, improved 60% from the preoperative score to the last follow-up, that is, from 7.8 to 3.1. Excellent or good overall outcomes were achieved in 80% of the patients, a fair or unchanged outcome resulted in 15%, and a poor outcome occurred in 5%. Moreover, myelopathy, radiculopathy, axial back pain, and bladder and/or bowel dysfunction improved in 83.3%, 87.0%, 91.1%, and 87.5% of cases, respectively. Conclusions. The authors' early experience with a large multicenter series suggested that the minimally invasive lateral approach is a safe, reproducible, and efficacious procedure for achieving adequate decompression in thoracic disc herniations in a less invasive manner than conventional surgical techniques and without the use of endoscopes. Symptom resolution was achieved at similar rates using this approach as compared with the most efficacious techniques in the literature, and with fewer complications in most circumstances.

Extracorporeal irradiated tumor bone: A reconstruction option in diaphyseal Ewing's sarcomas	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Ewing's sarcomas; extracorporeal irradiation; limb salvage	LIMB-SALVAGE; ALLOGRAFTS; SURGERY; RESECTION; REIMPLANTATION; FRACTURES; INFECTION; DEFECTS; GRAFT	Background: Limb salvage in extremity tumors is now established as an oncologically safe option without compromising long-term survival. En bloc resection followed by extracorporeal radiation and reimplantation is a biological reconstruction option in diaphyseal Ewing's sarcomas. We analyzed the results of 12 cases of diaphyseal Ewing's sarcomas treated using this modality. Materials and Methods: Between March 2006 and March 2008, 12 patients with Ewing's sarcoma underwent enbloc resection and reconstruction, with reimplantation of the sterilized tumor bone, after extracorporeal irradiation. There were eight males and four females, with a mean age of 14 years (range 2 to 22 years). The femur was the most common bone involved (n = 8) followed by the tibia and the humerus (two cases each). All these patients were non-metastatic at presentation and received chemotherapy as per the existing hospital protocol. The mean length of the bone resected was 20 cm (range 11 to 25 cm). The specimen was irradiated with 50 Gy prior to reimplantation and stabilized with the host bone, using suitable internal fixation. Standard biplanar radiographs were assessed for evidence of union on the follow-up visits. The functional status was assessed using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Scoring system at the time of the last follow up. The mean follow up duration was 29 months (range 12 to 57 months). Results: Two patients (17%) had early infection with graft removal, hence are excluded from any analysis of union, however they are included when analysing complications such as infection. Rest 10 cases were analyzed for bony union at the osteotomy sites. Sixteen (84%) of the 19 osteotomy sites united primarily, without any intervention. Implant failure and non-union was seen at three diaphyseal osteotomy sites. The average time for union of all osteotomy sites was 7.2 months (range 3 to 13 months). The average time for union of the metaphyseal osteotomy sites was 5.9 months (range 3 to 12 months) and of diaphyseal osteotomy sites was 8.3 months (range 4 to 13 months). The mean Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Score was 27 (range 19 to 30) with a mean of 27. Nine of the ten patients with lower limb involvement were independent ambulators without additional aids. At the time of the last review, six patients were free of disease and six patients had died from the disease. There were two recurrences around the operative site. Both were associated with disseminated disease and in both the recurrences were in the soft tissue, away from the irradiated graft. Conclusion: Extracorporeal irradiation is a useful, convenient technique for limb salvage in diaphyseal Ewing's sarcomas when there is reasonable residual bone stock. It is oncologically safe and has good functional results. A radiation dose of 50 Gy for sterilizing the bone ensures adequate tumor kill, while minimizing the deleterious effects on the biomechanical and biological properties of the bone. The use of appropriate implants for adequate internal fixation and supplementary bone grafting at the index surgery may help reduce the need for subsequent additional interventions to achieve union. The limitations of this procedure are that it is not applicable in tumor bones that are structurally weak and in bones with pathological fractures.	[Puri, Ajay; Gulia, Ashish; Agarwal, M.

A series of 54 patients (16 women and 38 men) with 62 calcaneal fractures were treated over a period of 6.5 years. Forty-five patients with 50 calcaneal fractures were completely clinically and radiologically followed up. Clinical follow-up included assessment of range of motion, pain according to a visual analogue scale, the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society hindfoot score, and the short-form 36 health survey. Radiological follow-up included plain axial and lateral radiographs and measurement of the Bohler's angle and Gissane's angle. Independent Student's t test and paired Student's t test were used alongside the chi-square test to compare clinical and radiological data and score values between different groups of patients. Eleven patients showed breakage of the osteosynthesis material during the healing process and 2 patients sustained deep wound infection requiring revision surgery. At the final follow-up all fractures had healed. The average range of motion was supination 26.4 degrees (range 0 degrees to 50 degrees; SD 11.6 degrees), pronation 15.4 degrees (range 0 degrees to 30 degrees; SD 6.4 degrees), dorsal extension 14.3 degrees (range -10 degrees to 30 degrees; SD 8.0 degrees), and plantarflexion 39.6 degrees (range 20 degrees to 65 degrees; SD 11.7 degrees). Patients with OTA type C4 fractures achieved significantly lower supination (p < .01) and plantarflexion (p < .01) compared with other fracture types. The mean visual analog scale pain score was 3.6 (range 0 to 8; SD 2.3) points, average American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society hindfoot score was 70.8 (range 33 to 100; SD 17.1) points, and the mean short-form 36 score was 60.98 (range 22.9 to 93.0; SD 18.4) points. The mean postoperative Bohler's angle was 28.9 degrees (range 8 degrees to 38 degrees; SD 7.1 degrees), which decreased to 23.6 degrees (range 4 degrees to 34 degrees; SD 8.7 degrees) at the final follow-up, and the mean postoperative Gissane's angle was 108.6 degrees (range 80 degrees to 140 degrees; SD 11.8 degrees), which finally decreased to 102.4 degrees (range 72 degrees to 126 degrees; SD 12.7 degrees). No statistically significant differences regarding Bohler's and Gissane's angles were found between different OTA fracture types. In conclusion, the presented surgical technique was found to provide comparable and adequate reduction of OTA type C2-C4 injuries based on statistically insignificant differences in radiographic measures of postoperative fracture reduction. Greater limitation in subtalar motion was observed in OTA type C4 fractures in comparison with less severe fractures (p < .01). (C) 2012 by the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons.

A retrospective matched cohort study. Objective. To comprehensively compare the 2-year postoperative results of posterior correction and fusion with segmental pedicle screw instrumentation versus those with hook constructs in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) treated at a single institution. Summary of Background Data. Despite the reports of satisfactory correction and maintenance of scoliotic curves by pedicle screw instrumentation compared to hook constructs, few reports on the comprehensive comparison of segmental pedicle screw instrumentation versus hook instrumentation exist Materials and Methods. A total of 52 patients with AIS at a single institution who underwent a posterior spinal fusion with segmental pedicle screw (26) or hook (26) instrumentation were sorted and matched according to four criteria: similar age at surgery (14.8 years in pedicle screw group and 14.2 years in hook group), identical Lenke curve types, same number of fused vertebrae (11.7 in each group), and identical operative methods (18 posterior spinal fusions with thoracoplasty, 4 posterior spinal fusions with iliac crest bone graft, and 4 anterior and posterior spinal fusions in each group). Patients were evaluated before surgery, immediate after surgery, and at the 2-year follow-up according to radiographic changes in curve correction, pulmonary function tests, operative time, intraoperative blood loss, implant costs, and SRS-24 scores. Results. After surgery, the average major curve correction was 76% in the screw group and 50% in the hook group (P < 0.001). At the 2-year follow-up, loss of the major curve correction was less in the screw group (5.4%) compared with the hook group (8.0%) (P = 0.35). Postoperative global coronal and sagittal balance was similar in both groups. An average of 0.8 levels from the distal end vertebra was saved using pedicle screws compared with hook constructs (P = 0.002). Postoperative 2-year proximal junctional change in the sagittal plane (angle between uppermost instrumented vertebra and two vertebral bodies above the uppermost-instrumented vertebra) was 9 in the screw group and 6 in the hook group (P = 0.19). Postoperative 2-year distal junctional change in the sagittal plane was similar in both groups. Operative time averaged 341 minutes in the screw group and 338 minutes in the hook group (P = 0.86), and intraoperative blood loss was similar in both groups (879 mL in screw group vs. 896 mL in hook group) (P = 0.12). Average implant cost in the hook group (11.8 fixation points; 5,816 U. S. dollars) was significantly lower than that of the screw group (17.1 fixation points; 11,508 U. S. dollars) (P < 0.001). Two years following surgery, the screw group demonstrated improved percent predicted pulmonary function values compared with that of the hook group (FVC, 80%-->79% in screw group vs. 82%-->74% in hook group, P = 0.0056; FEV-1, 73%-->76% in screw group vs. 80%-->79% in hook group, P = 0.017). Postoperative 2-year SRS-24 scores were similar in both groups (screw group [97] vs. hook group [101]) (P = 0.15). There were no neurologic or visceral complications related to hook or pedicle screw instrumentation. Conclusion. Pedicle screw instrumentation, although more expensive, offers a significantly better major and minor curve correction without neurologic problems and improved pulmonary function values in the operative treatment of AIS and enables a slightly shorter fusion length than segmental hook instrumentation.

FRONTIERS IN SURGERY			English	Article						chest wall; blunt thoracic trauma; rib fractures; rib stabilization; flail chest; flail segment	SURGICAL STABILIZATION; CHEST-WALL; OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; INJURIES; FIXATION	Introduction: Management of traumatic rib fractures is subject of controversial discussions. Rib fractures are common, especially after traffic accidents and falls. There is no consensus on whether and how many rib fractures need reconstruction. Not every rib fracture needs to be stabilized, but conservative treatment by internal splinting and analgesia is not effective for all patients. Deformities of the chest wall with reduced thoracic volume and restrictive ventilation disorders must be avoided. Intraoperative assessment of fractures and chest stability plays a central role. Material and methods: From 07/2016 to 07/2021, a total of 121 chest wall stabilizations were performed (m:f = 2:1, age 65 +/- 14.5 a). Indications for surgery were the following criteria: (1) palpatory instability of the chest wall, (2) dislocated fracture endings, (3) concomitant injuries, (4) uncontrollable pain symptoms. In all patients, a computed tomography scan of the thorax was performed before the osteosynthetic treatment to assess dislocation of the fracture endings and possible concomitant injuries of intrathoracic organs. Results: Video-assisted thoracoscopy was performed in all patients. Hemothorax and concomitant injuries of the lung, diaphragm and mediastinum could be assessed. This was followed by an intraoperative assessment of the rib fractures, in particular penetration of fracture endings and resulting instability and deformity. Relevant fractures could be identified and subsequent incisions for rib osteosynthesis precisely defined. 6.3 (+/- 2.7) rib fractures were detected, but 2.4 (+/- 1.2) ribs treated osteosynthetically. Bilateral rib fractures were present in 26 patients (21.5%). Post-operative bleeding occurred in seven patients (5.8%), a breakage of the osteosynthetic material in two patients (1.7%). Discussion: Intraoperative assessment of relevant fractures and dislocation is the decisive criterium for osteosynthesis. Thoracoscopy is mandatory for this purpose - also to identify accompanying injuries. Not every fracture has to be approached osteosynthetically. Even with serial rib fractures or multiple fractures in a single rib, the thoracic contour can be restored by stabilizing only relevant fractures. Intraoperative palpation can adequately assess the stability and thus the result of the osteosynthesis. Even after surgical treatment of thoracic trauma, adequate analgesia and respiratory therapy are important to the healing process.

J	Takase, K; Yamamoto, K				Takase, Katsumi; Yamamoto, Kengo			Outcomes and function of conoid ligament on the basis of postoperative radiographic findings of arthroscopic stabilization for the distal clavicle fractures	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Distal clavicle fracture; Arthroscopic reconstruction; Superoposterior displacement of the clavicle; Conoid ligament	NEER TYPE-II; HOOK PLATE	Purpose: Distal clavicle fractures are divided into three types according to Neer's classification. These fractures are usually treated with a sling to immobilize the upper extremity, however, the treatment of type 2 fractures remain controversial. We focused on the anatomical basis of these fractures in which disruptions in the conoid ligament led to the distraction between the two bony fragments. In this study, we report an arthroscopic procedure for conoid ligament reconstruction and its therapeutic outcomes, and discuss the function of the reconstructed conoid ligament. Hypothesis: Arthroscopic conoid ligament reconstruction alone is sufficient to retain the posteriorly displaced proximal fragment of the clavicle in its reduced position. Materials and methods: A retrospective cohort study were conducted on 18 patients with type 2 distal clavicle fractures. Arthroscopic techniques were performed with the patients in the beach chair position. Dacron artificial ligament (R) was used to reconstruct the conoid ligament, and the internal bone fixation materials included an EndoButton (R) on the coracoid process side and a screw with a spiked washer on the clavicle side. Preoperative assessment was performed via plain radiography or three-dimensional computed tomography to evaluate the displacement of the proximal fragment. Although the displacement was superoposterior in all the cases, the acromioclavicular joint was maintained. The mean duration of postoperative follow-up was 2 years and 5 months. Result: There were no injury-related complications during the surgery and bony union was achieved within 3 months after surgery. Evaluation using 3DCT also showed that the preoperative superoposterior displacement of the proximal fragment of the clavicle was immediately reduced postoperatively, and this reduced position was maintained until the final follow-up examination. Conclusions: We achieved good results by indirectly reducing fractures of the distal clavicle with conoid ligament damage using the minimally invasive surgical technique of arthroscopic conoid ligament reconstruction. Anatomical reconstruction of the conoid ligament might stabilize not only the superior displacement of the displaced proximal fragment of the clavicle but also its posterior displacement.

J	Goyal, R; Goel, SA; Bhatia, N				Goyal, Rakesh; Goel, Shakti A.; Bhatia, Nishant			Determination of outcomes of complex upper end tibial fractures in squatting and cross leg sitting South Asian population	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Complex fractures; Cross leg sitting; South Asian population; Squatting; Upper end tibia	PLATEAU FRACTURES; SCHATZKER CLASSIFICATION; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OSTEOSYNTHESIS; MANAGEMENT	Introduction: Treatment of complex upper end tibial fractures has always been a challenge to orthopaedic surgeons. Though the roentgenogram results are satisfactory, the clinical and functional outcomes especially in terms of squatting/cross-leg sitting after long term follow-up are little known. Hence, we have done this study with a primary aim to assess the clinico-radiological and functional outcomes after operative fixation (mostly by locking plates) in complex upper end tibial fractures and a secondary aim to analyze correlation between functional outcome scores/range of motion (ROM) and the ability to squat & sit cross-legged in post-operative period. Materials and methods: This prospective study included a total of 33 patients who were mainly treated with locking plates. In the follow-up, patients were assessed clinico-radiologically and outcome measurements were determined using the Tegner-Lysholm (T-L) Knee Score. Patients were categorized according to their ability to squat/sit cross-legged and a subgroup analysis was performed by comparing mean ROM and T-L score in each group. Results: Majority of patients were in young and adult age group with a male to female ratio of 4.5:1. The average age was 42.39 +/- 14.64 years. Road traffic accident was the most common mode of injury. Average time interval between injury and surgery was 5.8 +/- 4.4 days. All the fractures united by 5-9 months. Mean ROM and T-L score at last follow-up were 120.94 degrees +/- 13.63 degrees and 88.12 +/- 7.24 respectively. Average shortening, varus and valgus deformity were 0.43 +/- 0.09 cm, 2.12 degrees +/- 0.62 degrees and 1.06 degrees +/- 0.45 degrees respectively. 14 patients (42.42%) were able to squat and 15 (45.45%) were able to sit cross-legged postoperatively. Upon subgroup analysis, difference of mean ROM in those who could squat/sit cross-legged was found statistically significant ( p <= 0.05), however the difference in mean functional scores was not significant ( p >= 0.05). Conclusion: Complex upper tibial fractures are a difficult entity to deal with. Anatomical locking plates take care of the alignment, articular congruity as well as ligamentous balancing thus giving good midterm outcomes after ORIF/MIPO. However, applicability of the present functional outcome scores in assessing squatting/cross leg sitting remains doubtful. More weightage needs to be given to these activities to evaluate the outcome in South Asian population. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Progression toward osteoarthritis after wellconducted surgery and associated risk factors have been little reported. We performed a retrospective study: (1) to assess rates of post-traumatic elbow osteoarthritis after surgical treatment of TT; (2) to assess functional impact; and (3) to identify prognostic factors. Hypothesis: Prevalence of osteoarthritis after surgical treatment of TT is high, impairing functional results. Material and method: A single-center retrospective study included 53 patients, with a mean age of 50 + 17.8 years (range, 21-84 years), undergoing surgery for acute TT in our department. All received clinical examination with ranges of motion and Mayo Elbow Performance Index (MEPI) and radiographic assessment at a minimum 1 year's follow-up. Osteoarthritis at last follow-up was assessed on elbow X-ray in the humero-ulnar and radio-condylar compartments on the Broberg-Morrey classification. Functional impact on range of motion and MEPI and prognostic factors were assessed on Student test or ANOVA and Chi2 or Fisher test. Results: Prevalence of Broberg-Morrey grade 2 or 3 osteoarthritis was 45.3% (24/53) in the humero-ulnar compartment and 50% (25/50) in the radio-condylar compartment. Humero-ulnar osteoarthritis impaired MEPI (76.3 points with versus 88.4 points without; p = 0.003), flexion-extension (102.3 degrees versus 115.2 degrees p = 0.043) and pronation-supination (138.8 degrees versus 159.3 degrees p = 0.006). Radio-condylar osteoarthritis had no significant impact on MEPI (81.4 points with and 84.4 points without; p = 0.47), flexion extension (104.8 degrees and 113 degrees p = 0.23) or pronation-supination (141.8 degrees and 156.4 degrees p = 0.2). Humero-ulnar osteoarthritis at last follow-up was associated with dislocation or subluxation on immediate postoperative lateral view (45.8% with versus 10.3% without; p = 0.004) and at last follow-up (20.8% versus 3.4%; p = 0.047) and with postoperative complications (54.2% and 27.6%; p = 0.049). Radio-condylar osteoarthritis at last follow-up was associated with radial head replacement rather than internal fixation (respectively, 92% and 48%; p = 0.0007) and excessively high radial head implant positioning (47.8% versus 0%; p = 0.023). Conclusion: Prevalence of traumatic osteoarthritis after TT surgery was high, at 45.3% in the humeroulnar compartment and 50% in the radio-condylar compartment, with clinical impact in humero-ulnar involvement.

High strength, biodegradable and cytocompatible alpha tricalcium phosphate-iron composites for temporal reduction of bone fractures	ACTA BIOMATERIALIA			English	Article						Biodegradable metal; Tricalcium phosphate; Spark plasma sintering; Mechanical properties; Degradation test	POWDER-METALLURGY METHOD; HARD-TISSUE REPLACEMENT; IN-VIVO BIOACTIVITY; BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS; BIOCERAMIC COMPOSITES; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; IMPLANT APPLICATIONS; HYDROXYAPATITE; VITRO; TITANIUM	In this work alpha tricalcium phosphate (alpha-TCP)/iron (Fe) composites were developed as a new family of biodegradable, load-bearing and cytocompatible materials. The composites with composition from pure ceramic to pure metallic samples were consolidated by pulsed electric current assisted sintering to minimise processing time and temperature while improving their mechanical performance. The mechanical strength of the composites was increased and controlled with the Fe content, passing from brittle to ductile failure. In particular, the addition of 25 vol% of Fe produced a ceramic matrix composite with elastic modulus much closer to cortical bone than that of titanium or biodegradable magnesium alloys and specific compressive strength above that of stainless steel, chromium-cobalt alloys and pure titanium, currently used in clinic for internal fracture fixation. All the composites studied exhibited higher degradation rate than their individual components, presenting values around 200 um/year, but also their compressive strength did not show a significant reduction in the period required for bone fracture consolidation. Composites showed preferential degradation of alpha-TCP areas rather than beta-TCP areas, suggesting that alpha-TCP can produce composites with higher degradation rate. The composites were cytocompatible both in indirect and direct contact with bone cells. Osteoblast-like cells attached and spread on the surface of the composites, presenting proliferation rate similar to cells on tissue culture-grade polystyrene and they showed alkaline phosphatase activity. Therefore, this new family of composites is a potential alternative to produce implants for temporal reduction of bone fractures. Statement of Significance Biodegradable alpha-tricalcium phosphate/iron (alpha-TCP/Fe) composites are promising candidates for the fabrication of temporal osteosynthesis devices. Similar to biodegradable metals, these composites can avoid implant removal after bone fracture healing, particularly in young patients. In this work, alpha-TCP/Fe composites are studied for the first time in a wide range of compositions, showing not only higher degradation rate in vitro than pure components, but also good cytocompatibility and mechanical properties controllable with the Fe content. Ceramic matrix composites show high specific strength and low elastic modulus, thus better fulfilling the requirements for bone fractures fixation. A significant advance over previous works on the topic is the use of pulsed electric current assisted sintering together with alpha-TCP, convenient to improve the mechanical performance and degradation rate, respectively.

Methods: Thirty patients under-went osteofixation with poly (L-lactide-co-DL-lactide) copolymer and 30 had 2.0-mm titanium-miniplate osteosyntheses. Lateral cephalograms were analyzed preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 1-year follow-up. Average +/- SD values were as follows in resorbable plate-osteosyntheses (number of cases/titanium controls): for maxillary advancement, 3.5 +/- 4.1 mm (n = 19)/5.4 +/- 3.5 mm (n = 21); setback, 2.8 +/- 3.7 mm (n = 9)/1.9 +/- 1.8 mm (n = 8); elongation, 4.2 +/- 3.6 mm (n = 18)/3.7 +/- 5.2 mm (n = 14); and intrusion, 1.9 +/- 1.7 mm (n = 12)/3.3 +/- 2.7 mm (n = 13); for mandibular advancement, 4.6 +/- 3.6 mm (n = 10)/6.3 +/- 8.8 mm (n = 18); setback, 7.5 +/- 8.3 mm (n = 20) /7.2 +/- 3.2 mm (n = 12); enlargement of the mandibular angle, 11.8 +/- 9.9 degrees (n = 19)/7.9 +/- 6.6 degrees (n = 21); and reduction, 4.5 +/- 3.2 degrees (n = 9)/6.3 6.6 degrees (n = 9). Results: Preoperative to postoperative landmark positions within the study and control groups differed highly significantly (p = 0.008, paired t test), yet the amount of operative movement was comparable between the study and control groups (p = 0.5, two-sided t test). Absolute instability at the advanced A-point was (study group/controls) 2.3 +/- 1.8/2.4 +/- 2 mm, setback was 2.3 +/- 1.9 mm/2.5 +/- 1.7 mm, elongation at the anterior nasal spine was 3.8 +/- 3.1 mm/3.1 +/- 3.6 mm, intrusion was 2.1 +/- 1.9 mm/2.2 +/- 1.5 mm, advancement instability at the B-point was 4.9 +/- 4.3 mm/5.1 +/- 8.2 mm, setback was 3.0 +/- 2 mm/1.7 +/- 2 mm, mandibular angle enlargement instability was 6.7 +/- 8.9 degrees/8.2 +/- 9.6 degrees, and angle narrowing was 6.8 +/- 5.2 degrees/4.2 +/- 5.9 degrees. Absolute postoperative instability did not differ significantly between the study and control groups (p = 0.6). Conclusions: Resorbable osteofixation as tested proved to be as reliable as titanium, but as the study and control groups were not matched, the results have to be interpreted as preliminary. Resorbable materials permitted clinically faster occlusal and condylar settling than standard titanium osteosyntheses, as bone segments showed slight clinical mobility up to 6 weeks postoperatively.

Treatment Algorithm for Pilon Fracture - Clinical and Radiological Results	ACTA CHIRURGIAE ORTHOPAEDICAE ET TRAUMATOLOGIAE CECHOSLOVACA			English	Article						pilon; distal tibia fracture; outcome; algorithm	DISTAL TIBIA; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; MANAGEMENT	PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The aim of the present study was to evaluate the postoperative outcome of patients with pilon tibial fractures with a minimum follow-up of 24 months, treated according to a staged treatment algorithm. MATERIAL AND METHODS In total, 27 patients (mean age 43.6 +/- 13 years, range 18-69) with a pilon tibial fracture and a minimum follow-up of 24 months were included in the study. Medical recordings (discharge documents and surgical reports) and radiographic examinations were analyzed. All enrolled patients were invited for a clinical and radiological follow-up examination (ROM, AOFAS hindfoot score, Kellgren score). The mean follow-up time was 44.5 +/- 16 months (range 24-82). RESULTS In 21 cases a two-stage operative strategy with initial closed reduction and external fixation was necessary prior to definitive osteosynthesis. Overall, the patients scored 82.1 +/- 20 points (range 30-100) in AOFAS hindfoot score, which represents a good clinical outcome. Patients with B-type fractures scored significantly better than those with C-type fractures. Patients with closed pilon tibial fractures reached significantly higher values in the AOFAS hindfoot score than those with open ones. Age and gender did not affect the functional outcome. Total ankle range of motion was 41 degrees +/- 10 degrees for B-type fractures (range 20 degrees-55 degrees) and 35 degrees +/- 17 degrees (range 0 degrees-60 degrees) for C-type fractures respectively (p > 0.05). Only five patients reached higher scores (Grade III) in Kellgren classification system. DISCUSSION Within the last decades, the therapeutic algorithm of pilon fractures underwent a paradigm shift; a two-stage protocol has prevailed today. However, the initial severity of the fracture in terms of initial absorbed energy, bony comminution and soft-tissue trauma still affects the outcome. Moreover, the necessity for bone grafting, as an indirect measurement of bone comminution and bone defects, resulted in higher degrees of osteoarthritis in the final follow-up. Higher initial soft-tissue injury also had an impact on the functional outcome of the patients, as patients with closed fractures scored better in AOFAS at the final follow-up. In order to counteract these risk factors and to reduce complications that define the outcome of these severe injuries, clearly defined surgical principles and standardized treatment protocols are needed. CONCLUSIONS The present study confirms the fact that meticulous planning, respect of the soft-tissues and choice of the optimal time-point for the definitive osteosynthesis and overall treatment according to standardized protocols can optimize the outcome of this severe injury.

Objective The aims of this study are to investigate the effects of IM technique and WBR technique in repairing segmental bone defects, and to analyze the similarities and differences between them. Materials and Methods 66 patients of tibial segmental bone defects treated by IM technique and WBG technique were retrospectively analyzed. Aged 13-69 years old with an average of 35.3 years old. IM technique was divided into early IM group (bone grafting at 6-8 weeks of bone cement filling) and late IM group (bone grafting after 8 weeks of bone cement filling). WBG was divided into titanium mesh group and line suturing cortical bone blocks group. There were 11 cases, 25 cases, 10 cases and 20 cases in the early IM group, late IM group, titanium mesh group and line suturing group, respectively. Bone healing, complications and functional recovery (Paley's method) were observed, the causes of nonunion and delayed union and factors affecting bone healing were analyzed. Results There were no significant differences in terms of age, sex, defect length, course, fixation method, defect location and preoperative function of adjacent joints among the 4 groups. All patients were followed up for 12-50 months, with an average of 20.1 months. The clinical healing time of early IM group, late IM group, titanium mesh group and line suturing group were (5.81 +/- 0.75) months, (7.56 +/- 1.66) months, (7.50 +/- 0.70) months and (7.81 +/- 1.81) months, respectively, showing significant differences among the 4 groups (P = 0.005). However, only early IM group had significant difference with other groups (P < 0.05), while no significance was found between late IM group and WBR group, between titanium mesh group and suture group (P > 0.05). There were no significant differences in healing ration, complications and functional recovery of adjacent joints among the 4 groups (P > 0.05). There were 4 cases of nonunion and delayed union, all of which were caused by poor quantity or quality of bone graft or unstable bone graft or internal fixation. Conclusion Both IM technique and WBG technique are effective method for repairing segmental bone defects. In addition to mechanical encapsulation, early IM has biological osteogenesis. However, mechanical encapsulation is a common basis for repairing bone defects, and biological osteogenesis can enhance bone healing.

Materials and methods A total of 153 patients with hip instrumentation who had undergone CT with adaptive iterative dose reduction (AIDR) 3D and SEMAR algorithms between February 2015 and October 2019 were included retrospectively. Patients were divided into 5 groups by the hardware type. Two readers with 21 and 13 years of experience blindly reviewed all image sets and graded the extent of artifacts and imaging quality using 5-point scales. To evaluate reliability, the mean densities and image noises were measured at the urinary bladder, veins, and fat in images with artifacts and the reference images. Results No significant differences were found in the mean densities of the urinary bladder, veins, and fat between the SEMAR images with artifacts (7.57 +/- 9.49, 40.29 +/- 23.07, 86.78 +/- 38.34) and the reference images (7.77 +/- 6.2, 40.27 +/- 8.66, 89.10 +/- 20.70) (P = .860, .994, .392). Image noises of the urinary bladder in the SEMAR images with artifacts (14.25 +/- 4.50) and the SEMAR reference images (9.69 +/- 1.29) were significantly higher than those in the AIDR 3D reference images (9.11 +/- 1.12) (P < .001; P < .001). All AIDR 3D images were non-diagnostic (overall quality <= 3) and less than a quarter of the SEMAR images were non-diagnostic (16.7-23.7%), mainly in patients with prostheses [reader 1: 91.7% (22/24); reader 2: 92.6% (25/27)]. Conclusion The SEMAR algorithm significantly reduces metal artifacts in CT images, more in patients with internal fixations than in patients with prostheses, and provides reliable attenuation of soft tissues.

Regional differences in the three-dimensional bone microstructure of the radial head: implications for observed fracture patterns	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Elbow; Radial head; Fracture; Micro-CT; Trabeculae	COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; FORCE TRANSMISSION; MICROARCHITECTURE; ELBOW; DENSITY; RECONSTRUCTION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; KINEMATICS; STRENGTH; VOLUME	Introduction A characterization of the internal bone microstructure of the radial head could provide a better understanding of commonly occurring fracture patterns frequently involving the (antero)lateral quadrant, for which a clear explanation is still lacking. The aim of this study is to describe the radial head bone microstructure using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and to relate it to gross morphology, function and possible fracture patterns. Materials and methods Dry cadaveric human radii were scanned by micro-CT (17 mu m/pixel, isotropic). The trabecular bone microstructure was quantified on axial image stacks in four quadrants: the anterolateral (AL), posterolateral (PL), posteromedial (PM) and anteromedial (AM) quadrant. Results The AL and PL quadrants displayed the significantly lowest bone volume fraction and trabecular number (BV/TV range 12.3-25.1%, Tb.N range 0.73-1.16 mm(-1)) and highest trabecular separation (Tb.Sp range 0.59-0.82 mm), compared to the PM and AM quadrants (BV/TV range 19.9-36.9%, Tb.N range 0.96-1.61 mm(-1), Tb.Sp range 0.45-0.74 mm) (p = 0.03). Conclusions Our microstructural results suggest that the lateral side is the "weaker side", exhibiting lower bone volume faction, less trabeculae and higher trabecular separation, compared to the medial side. As the forearm is pronated during most falls, the underlying bone microstructure could explain commonly observed fracture patterns of the radial head, particularly more often involving the AL quadrant. If screw fixation in radial head fractures is considered, surgeons should take advantage of the "stronger" bone microstructure of the medial side of the radial head, should the fracture line allow this.

Radial head replacement with the MoPyC pyrocarbon prosthesis	JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY			English	Article						Radial head replacement; pyrocarbon	SILICONE-RUBBER REPLACEMENT; COMMINUTED FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; VALGUS STABILITY; FOLLOW-UP; ELBOW; ARTHROPLASTY; RESECTION; IMPLANTS; NECK	Background: Radial head fractures often pose therapeutic dilemmas. We present the early results of patients who underwent radial head replacement with the MoPyC prosthesis (Bioprofile, Tornier, Saint-Ismier, France). Materials and methods: We re-evaluated patients who underwent post-traumatic radial head resection and implantation of the MoPyC prosthesis due to pain and motion restriction. All patients underwent radiographic evaluation. Clinical evaluation was performed using the Broberg-Morrey and the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) scales. Results: Thirty-two patients (20 men, 12 women; mean age, 54 years; 22 dominant upper limbs) were evaluated. Twenty had a comminuted radial head fracture (Mason IV, 15; Mason III, 5), 2 from radial head fracture malunion, and 10 had complex elbow injuries (comminuted radial head fractures with ligamentous ruptures with or without coronoid process fractures). Mean follow-up was 27 months (range, 21-46 months). The mean results at the latest follow-up were flexion-extension, 130 degrees (range, 105 degrees-150 degrees); pronation, 74 degrees (range, 60 degrees-80 degrees); and supination, 72 degrees (range, 60 degrees-80 degrees). No laxity was evident during valgus and varus stress tests. Mean grip strength was 96% of the contralateral side. Broberg-Morrey scores were excellent in 33%, good in 44%, and fair in 23%. MEPS results were excellent in 80%, good in 17%, and fair in 3%. There were 6 cases of periprosthetic lucencies or osteolysis of the radius without any clinical signs of loosening. Conclusions: Radial head replacement with the MoPyC pyrocarbon prosthesis (when performed in carefully selected patients) yields satisfactory results regarding range of motion and function of the elbow joint.

Material and methods: A total of 337 community-dwelling elderly patients with acute hip fracture were observed during a 12-month period at a major teaching hospital in Serbia. Cognitive status was assessed at admission with the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ). Outcome after 4 months was analysed with respect to presence of severe cognitive impairment, defined as an SPMSQ score of < 3. Outcome assessment included presence of postoperative complications, absolute motor Functional Independence Measure (FIM) gain, Activities of Daily Living index (ADL), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living score (IADL), and walking ability. Results: An SPMSQ score of < 3 was observed in 36 patients (10.7%) with acute hip fracture. Patients with an SPMSQ score of < 3 achieved worse short-term outcomes regarding all observed variables. However, cognitive status was found to be an independent predictor only with respect to mortality at 4 months (odds ratio (OR) = 0.969, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.947-0.992, p = 0.009). In contrast, pre-fracture motor FIM independently predicted mortality (OR = 2.982, 95% CI = 1.271-7.000, p = 0.012), and preserved walking ability at 4 months follow-up (OR = 0.945, 95% CI = 0.912-0.980, p = 0.002). Correspondingly, pre-fracture ADL was an independent predictor of absolute motor FIM gain at 4 months follow-up (OR = 0.175, 95% CI = 0.405-11.426, p = 0.035). Conclusions: Failure to consider functional status prior to fracture might overestimate the impact of cognitive status on functional outcome of hip fracture patients.

However, it is not clear whether this material can be clinically used to treat pediatric epiphyseal injury and surrounding bone fracture. Methods: The PPSP and standard plate (SP) were designed to configure to the femoral condyle. Twelve premature female goats were enrolled in this study. Fracture models were successfully established on goats, on which the right femurs were fixed with SP, and the left femurs were fixed with PPSP. Radiographic analysis and biomechanical tests were done at 4 and 8 weeks after surgery. Results: The callus gray density increased with time going on in each group, at the same postoperational time point, the PPSP group was higher than that of the SP group. The difference between PPSP group and SP group was statistically significant at the same stage (P<0.01). The biomechanical tests showed that the PPSP group was stronger than the SP group in anticompression, antibending, and antitorsion at the same stage (P<0.05). In addition, it was shown through the radiographic analysis that PPSP extended accordingly as the epiphyseal plate grows, and the epiphyseal morphology was considered normal all the time. However, epiphyseal premature closure and angular deformity were observed in the samples of the SP group. Conclusions: PPSP contributed greatly to healing of bone fracture with increased callus density and callus strength in the early stage, and did not restrict the growth of the epiphyseal plate. It may be clinically applied in the treatment of pediatric epiphyseal injury and surrounding bone fracture in the future. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic level II.

In this paper, we designed an effective new surface grafting with the assist of l-lysine for nano-hydroxyapatite, and the nano-hydroxyapatite surface grafted with the assist of l-lysine (g-nano-hydroxyapatite) was incorporated into poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) to develop a series of g-nano-hydroxyapatite/poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) nano-composites. The surface modification reaction for nano-hydroxyapatite, the mechanical properties, and invitro human osteoblast-like cell (MG-63) response were characterized and investigated by Fourier transformation infrared, thermal gravimetric analysis, dispersion test, electromechanical universal tester, differential scanning calorimeter measurements, and invitro cells culture experiment. The results showed that the grafting amount on the surface of nano-hydroxyapatite was enhanced with the increase of l-lysine, and the dispersion of nano-hydroxyapatite was improved more, so that it brought about better promotion crystallization and more excellent mechanical enhancement effect for poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid), comparing with the unmodified nano-hydroxyapatite. Moreover, the cells' attachment and proliferation results confirmed that the incorporation of the g-nano-hydroxyapatite into poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) exhibited better biocompatibility than poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid). The above results indicated that the new surface grafting with the assist of l-lysine for nano-hydroxyapatite was an ideal novel surface modification method, which brought about better mechanical enhancement effect and invitro bioactivity for poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) with adding higher g-nano-hydroxyapatite content, suggesting it had a great potential to be used as bone fracture internal fixation materials in future.

However, insufficient fixation of the distal fragment could result in delayed healing, malunion or nonunion. Recently, a novel concept for angular stable nailing was developed that maintains the principle of relative stability and introduces improvements expected to reduce nail toggling, screw migration and secondary loss of reduction. The aim of this study was to investigate the biomechanical competence of the novel angular stable intramedullary nail concept for treatment of unstable distal tibia fractures, compared to a conventional nail locking in a human cadaveric model under dynamic loading. Materials and methods: Ten pairs of fresh-frozen human cadaveric tibiae with a simulated AO/OTA 42-A3.1 fracture were assigned to 2 groups for reamed intramedullary nailing using either a conventional (non-angular stable) Expert Tibia Nail (ETN) with 3 distal screws or the novel Tibia Nail Advanced (TNA) system with 2 distal angular stable locking low-profile retaining screws. The specimens were biomechanically tested under conditions including initial quasi-static loading, followed by progressively increasing combined cyclic axial and torsional loading in internal rotation until failure of the bone-implant construct. Both tests were monitored by means of motion tracking. Results: Initial nail toggling of the distal tibia fragment in varus and flexion under axial loading was lower for TNA compared to ETN, being significant in flexion, P = 0.91 and P = 0.03. After 5000 cycles, interfragmentary movements in terms of varus, flexion, internal rotation, axial displacement, and shear displacement at the fracture site were all lower for TNA compared to ETN, with flexion and shear displacement being significant, P = 0.14, P = 0.04, P = 0.25, P = 0.11 and P = 0.04, respectively. Cycles to failure until both interfragmentary 5 degrees varus and 5 degrees flexion were significantly higher for TNA compared to ETN, P = 0.04. Conclusion: From a biomechanical perspective, the novel angular stable intramedullary nail concept provides increased construct stability and maintains it over time while reducing the number of required locking screws without impeding the flexibility of the nail itself and resists better towards loss of reduction under dynamic loading, compared to conventional locking in intramedullary nailed unstable distal tibia fractures.

Materials and Methods: A prospective study was performed of 21 bear-associated injuries sustained to the facial region. Most patients were young to middle age and most were male. Most attacks occurred during the daytime, and the highest incidence occurred during the months of April to October. Wounds were assessed for soft and hard tissue injuries, including tissue loss, and corresponding management in the craniofacial region for 18 months. A standardized surgical treatment was used for patient management, which included thorough debridement of wounds and routine primary repair of soft tissue. Bony defect reconstruction was performed by open reduction and internal fixation. Regional or distant flaps were used for the reconstruction of soft tissue defects. Results: Mauled patients were treated for injuries varying from lacerations and puncture wounds to fractures and avulsive tissues. On average, most patients underwent a single operation for reconstruction of bony fractures and soft tissue repair and spent 3 to 7 days in the hospital; however, some patients underwent more than 1 operation and stayed in the hospital for more than 4 to 6 weeks. Facial fractures were mainly seen in the midfacial region (71%), followed by mandibular fractures (24%). Overall, the results were satisfactory, except for a few instances of scar formation, facial nerve palsy, and ectropion. The mortality rate was 5% (1 patient) from the severe injury caused by bear mauling. Conclusions: Extensive bear-bite injuries of the facial skeleton can be treated with immediate primary wound repair after meticulous wound debridement and according to commonly used criteria of esthetic reconstructive facial surgery.

Magnesium (Mg) and its alloys represent promising alternatives to produce biodegradable osteosynthesis devices, with biocompatibility and, specifically, hydrogen gas production during the degradation process, being the main drawback. Aim of this study is to test and compare biocompatibility, degradation rate and physiscochemical properties of two Mg-alloys to identify which one possesses the most suitable characteristics to be used as resorbable hardware in load-bearing fracture sites. Materials and methods: As-cast (WE43) and T5 Mg-alloys were tested for biocompatibility, physical, mechanical and degradation properties. Microstructure was assessed by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS); mechanical properties were tested utilizing quasi-static compression and failure analysis. Locoregional biocompatibility was tested by subperiosteal implantation on the fronto-nasal region of large-animal model (sheep): regional immuno-reaction and metal accumulation was analyzed by LA-ICP of tributary lymph-nodes, local reactions were analyzed through histological preparation including bone, implant and surrounding soft tissue. Results: Mechanically, T5 alloy showed improvement in strength compared to the as-cast. Lymph-node Mg accumulation depicted no differences between control (no implant) and study animals. Both alloys showed good biocompatibility and osteogenesis-promoting properties. Conclusion: This study demonstrated excellent biocompatibility and osteogenesis-promoting capabilities of the tested alloys, providing a platform for further studies to test them in a maxillofacial fracture setting. T-5 alloy displayed more stability and decreased degradation rate than the as-cast. (C) 2017 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The study aims to determine the influence of surgeons' experience and the technique of drilling on the complication rate. Materials and Methods: The sample involved 45 cadaveric humeri. Six orthopaedic surgeons were divided into two groups with regard to their level of experience (novice versus expert group). On each humerus two different proximal humerus plates were applied. Drillings were performed either with a sharp or worn drill bit (to simulate either sharp or blunt drilling). The respective holes were drilled until the respective participant thought to have placed the drill bit subchondrally, followed by perforation of the cartilage of the humeral head. Both these values and cases of unintended penetration of the articular cavity were evaluated. Results: Fourteen holes (3.6%) were primary penetrated in the joint cavity in the worn-drill-bit-subgroup and 19 holes (5%) in the sharp-drill-bit-group. The latter had an average distance between the chosen subchondral position and the humeral articular surface of 8.3 mm and the worn-drill-bit-subgroup was at 10.6 mm. In the novice group 20 perforations (5.2%) of the joint space occurred and the mean interval between the chosen subchondral point and the humeral articular surface was 4.0 mm. The experienced surgeons showed a perforation rate of 3.4% and were at a mean of 14.9 mm. There were no significant differences regarding drilling manoeuvres and experience. Conclusion: Although our results are satisfactory, they can be traced back to the relatively high interval between the respective chosen position of the drill bit and the humeral articular surface which may not guarantee screw stability during ORIF of all fracture patterns.

Development and characterization of a predictive microCT-based non-union model in Fischer F344 rats	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Fracture healing; Delayed union; Non-union; microCT; Osteotomy	REVERSE DYNAMIZATION; FIXATOR STIFFNESS; FRACTURE; RADIATION; MICE	Introduction Non-unions remain a clinical problem and are characterised by the failure to heal after a defined period of time. Current preclinical non-union models apply a wide variety of techniques to diminish intrinsic healing potential deviating from the clinical situation. The aim of this study was to develop and characterise a non-union model in rats using internal plate fixation without the need for additional healing insults, whereby bone healing can be longitudinally assessed using microCT. It was hypothesized that healing/non-unions can be accurately predicted at early time points by microCT. Materials and methods Female, skeletally mature Fischer F344 rats received a 2 mm or 1 mm femoral osteotomy, stabilized with either a 2 mm thick plate or a 1.25 mm thick plate. Healing was monitored by microCT over 14 weeks and histological analysis at euthanasia. The mechanical environment was characterised using finite element (FE) modelling and biomechanical testing. Results The majority of animals receiving the 2 mm thick plate displayed poor healing responses in both the 2 mm and 1 mm defect size groups. Bone and cartilage formation were markedly improved using the 1.25 mm thick plate. MicroCT could accurately predict bone forming capacity at early time points (3-4 weeks). Conclusions The 2 mm thick plating system confers poor healing responses in female Fischer F344 rats, comparable to atrophic non-unions. By reducing plate thickness to increase interfragmentary strain within the defect site healing is improved, leading to borderline healing situations or increased abundance of cartilage tissue present in the defect site with ultimate failure to bridge the defect (hypertrophic non-union). Furthermore, microCT can reliably identify delayed/non-healing animals within 4 weeks, thereby allowing their selective targeting for the testing of novel, clinically relevant treatment strategies in different clinical situations aimed at restoring impaired bone healing.

The purpose of this study was to retrospectively compare the subclavian and femoral approaches to a fixed-catheter-tip method of implantation of a port-catheter system for hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy with respect to complications and dysfunctions. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Between April 2006 and April 2012, 153 patients (104 men, 49 women; age range, 23-82 years; mean, 65 years) with unresectable malignant liver tumors underwent percutaneous implantation of indwelling port-catheter systems by the fixed-catheter-tip method via the left subclavian or femoral artery. The success of implantation and outcome of complications were investigated and compared between these approach routes. RESULTS. The overall technical success rate of port-catheter system implantation with the fixed-catheter-tip method was 99% (152 of 153 patients). Seventy-five patients underwent implantation with a port-catheter system via the left subclavian artery, and 77 patients via the femoral artery. Catheter dislocation occurred in 3.9% of the patients; hepatic artery obstruction, 2.6%; catheter occlusion, 3.9%; bleeding at the puncture site, 3.9%; cerebral infarction, 1.3%; and infection related to port-catheter implantation, 2.6%. No significant differences in complications and port-catheter system dysfunction between the left subclavian and femoral approaches to port-catheter system implantation with the fixed-catheter-tip method were seen in any of the parameters. In addition, cerebral infarction occurred exclusively with the left subclavian approach, whereas infection occurred exclusively with the femoral approach. CONCLUSION. Implantation of the port-catheter system with the fixed-catheter-tip method is equally feasible via both the left subclavian and the femoral approaches.

Utilization of the less-invasive stabilization system internal fixator for open fractures of the proximal tibia: A multi-center evaluation	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Less Invasive Stabilization System; open fractures; proximal tibia	INTRAMEDULLARY NAILS; EXTERNAL FIXATION; PLATEAU; SHAFT; DCP	Background: Locked plating has become popular and has clear biomechanical advantages when compared with conventional plating. When combined with minimally invasive surgical techniques, locked plating may cause substantially less iatrogenic tissue damage when compared with conventional plating. These characteristics may make locked plating an attractive option for treating open fractures of the tibial plateau and proximal tibia for which coverage over the plate can be obtained. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of the Less-Invasive Stabilization System (LISS) for high-energy open fractures involving either the tibial plateau or proximal tibia. Materials and Methods: This study is a retrospective evaluation of a consecutive multicenter series of 52 consecutive patients operated by seven surgeons, who used LISS plating in open proximal tibia or tibial plateau fractures seen at one of four Level I Trauma Centers. All patients were treated using a locked plating system that was implanted using minimally invasive submuscular surgical techniques. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of deep and superficial infection. Results: Fifty-two patients with open fractures have been evaluated, with a mean follow-up of 16.8 (12-36) months. Three patients (5.8) developed deep infections. Two patients (6.3) with tibial plateau and one (4.3) of patients with a tibial shaft fracture developed deep infections. Fifteen patients required flap coverage of their open wounds. The incidence of deep infection as per Gustilo and Anderson classification was Type I and II - 0 (0); Type IIIA - 2 (7.7); Type IIIB - 1 (7.1); and Type IIIC - 0 (0). Conclusions: Biomechanically, the LISS functions as an "internal-external fixator" rather than a plate. Traditional plate osteosynthesis has yielded rates of infection between 18 and 35. Our data indicate that locked plating using minimally invasive techniques yield deep infections rates that are no worse than published series using intramedullary nails or external fixators. Technical difficulties that can be encountered with the LISS system revolve primarily around obtaining and maintaining reduction while performing a minimally invasive procedure. Additional difficulties can include "cold welding" of screws to the plate and malposition of the plate leading to failure in the diaphysis. High-energy open fractures involving the tibia shaft or plateau remain high-risk injuries, but LISS is an acceptable alternative for treatment of these fractures.

The aim of the present study was to analyze surgical technique and long-term clinical and radiological results. Material and method: Between 1997 and 2008, 7 patients with a mean age of 5.7 years (range, 2-8 years) were operated on for bone malignancy with vascularized fibular epiphyseal transfer: 5 Ewing sarcomas and 2 osteosarcomas, located in the proximal femur (n = 3), proximal humerus (n = 3) or distal radius (n = 1). Mean transplant size was 13.8 cm. Vascularization involved a single artery in 5 cases (3 peroneal, 2 anterior tibial) and both in 2 cases. Internal fixation used intramedullary nailing in 6 cases and screwed plate in 1. All patients underwent preand post-operative chemotherapy following French Pediatric Oncology Society (SFOP) protocols. Results: Mean follow-up was 11 years (range, 3 years 11 months to > 17 years). All patients were alive and in tumor remission. Reconstructed joint function was satisfactory in 85% of cases. Graft thickening indicated integration in all cases. The transferred cartilage had recovered growth in 4 cases. Complications comprised postoperative infection (n =1), consolidation defects (n = 2), fractures (n = 8), malalignment requiring surgical revision (n = 1), and spontaneously resolving common peroneal nerve palsies (n = 2). Discussion: In young children, vascularized fibular epiphyseal transfer fills bone defect, reconstructs a functional joint and allows continued growth in the resected segment. Growth prostheses, in the authors' experience, always give poor results in this age-group, and fusion fails to address the growth problem. Patients should be informed about the risk of fracture, persisting over the long term.

Methods: As fracture model, an AO 31A2.3 fracture was used. Twelve pairs of human cadaver femora were tested. Femoral neck screws were implanted in the femoral head in center/center, posterior/central, and anterior/superior position in axial/frontal plane. A single-screw system (Gamma 3 Locking Nail; Stryker GmbH & Co. KG) and a 2-screw system (Trigen-Intertan; Smith & Nephew GmbH) were used. To simulate the load in situ, a cyclic load was carried for 10,000 cycles in a material testing machine. If no cyclic failure occurred, femora were loaded until the failure. The systems were compared according to the stiffness, survivability through 10 k cycles, TAD, and load to failure. Results: None of the tested bones failed at center/center location in the decentralized positions 3 Gamma Nail and 2 Intertan specimens failed during cyclic testing. The 2-screw system resisted higher forces in all positions (Gamma: 5370N +/- 1924, Intertan: 7650N +/- 2043; P = 0.014). Conclusions: Based on these data, it is clear that both the nail systems showed a higher biomechanical stability with a lower TAD. The 2 specimens that failed with the Intertan in the cyclic tests had a TAD >= 49 mm. The cutout failures that we detected during cyclic testing in the Gamma system had a TAD >= 30 mm. Thus, it is clear that the TAD affects failure independent of the implant used. With a less than ideal lag screw placement, however, the Intertan system with 2 integrated screws was able to withstand higher loads in this study.

Our experience in complications of orthognathic surgery: a retrospective study on 3236 patients	EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Orthognathic surgery; Surgical complication; Temporo-mandibular disorder; Nerve injuries	SAGITTAL SPLIT OSTEOTOMY; TEMPOROMANDIBULAR DISORDERS; ANTIBIOTIC-PROPHYLAXIS; RAMUS OSTEOTOMY; STABILITY; ADVANCEMENT; DYSFUNCTION; IMPAIRMENT; MAXILLA	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: From 1989 to 2009, at the Department of Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery, Umberto I Polyclinic, "Sapienza" University of Rome, 3236 patients affected by maxillo-mandibular malformations were submitted to orthognathic surgery, by means of rigid internal fixation. Follow-up high-lighted the surgical complications and the possible functional and/or esthetical disorders in the treatment of those pathologies. The data collected have been compared with the ones reported in the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 3236 patients were evaluated clinically and radiographically. The X-rays have been performed before the study, after 24-48 hours, at 6 months and year after surgery. RESULTS: The most frequent surgical complication was the mandibular nerve sensitivity deficit (19%), irreversible only in 2% of the cases. Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD), which are widely reported in the international literature, have been relevant in our study too. In particular, TMD occurred in those patients who were already affected by the disorder (from 28.3% to 18.1%); besides, in 11% of cases the symptom appeared after surgery and was treated by means of splint or physiotherapy. Infectious complications occurred in 2% of cases and fractures of the bone elements in 1.5% of cases. The other complications quoted internationally occurred in an irrelevant percentage in our study. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that orthognathic surgery complications are quite rare and the percentages reported both in our study and in the literature have to be considered as surgical mistakes related to the surgeon experience or as real complications of the orthognathic surgery. Furthermore, as the success of this kind of surgery depends upon many factors, surgical complications represent only one of the causes of the failure. Other causes could be mistakes in planning, unsuitable orthodontic treatment and, finally, an unsuitable assessment of the patients' esthetical and functional problems.	[Iannetti, G.; Fadda, T.

The objective of this paper is to improve the resource utilization rate of coal gangue, and study the influence mechanism of activated coal gangue powder (CGP) on the working performance, mechanical properties and water resistance of Coal Gangue-based Green Cemented Filling Body (CGGCFB) through macro and micro experiments. The results indicate the following: (1) The properties of CGGGCFB can be significantly improved by adding an appropriate activated CGP content. (2) Considering the economy, it is suggested that the replacement rate of activated CGP should be between 50%similar to 75%. (3) The micro-morphology effect and micro aggregate effect of activated CGP weaken the "micro-pump water absorption", "water storage" and surface particle friction of coal gangue aggregate, so that it has strong hydrophilicity, water fixation and water retention, thus the working performance is improved. (4) The pozzolanic effect and micro-aggregate filling effect of activated CGP not only increase the number and types of hydration products and bond energy in the filling body, make a large number of pores tend to be "spherical" or "arch" stress characteristics and enhance the stress characteristics of internal pores, but also restrain the extension of the original micro-cracks formed by the "material attribute defects" of coal gangue, thereby resulting in improvement of filling body strength and water resistance greatly. The research results of this paper can further improve the resource utilization rate of coal gangue resources, give full play to its advantages of regionalization and resource utilization, and provide theoretical reference for the research and application of coal gangue in mine filling.

CLINICAL NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Hangman's fracture; Pedicle screw; Long term results; Complications; C2-3 fusion; C2-3 instability	MANAGEMENT	Background/object: The recent trend for treatment of certain cases of type II Hangman's fracture has been towards motion preserving surgery. This is claimed to be achieved with placement of pedicle screws across the fracture fragments. However, the long term outcome in clinical scenario is not yet clear, neither are the factors determining suitability of such a technique. Materials and methods: We have retrospectively analyzed the results of 11 patients of type II Hangman's fracture, according to the extent of translation. Nine patients underwent stabilization of fracture with C2 pedicle screws and 2 were managed with halo immobilization. The conservative management failed in one and this patient underwent internal fixation using pars-pedicle screw as well. The long term clinical and radiological (CT and dynamic X-rays) outcome was analyzed. Results: All patients including the one with halo immobilization, showed solid fusion across the fracture fragments. With the exception of one patient none had any clinical symptoms. This lone patient complained of restricted neck movements. Three different types of radiological results were observed. Two patients with translation >8 mm showed C2-3 body fusion. Three of 6 patients with minimal translational (3-4 mm) showed facet fusion. Three patients with moderate translational dislocation (4.5-5.5 mm) showed persisting C2-3 angular instability. Conclusions: The C2 pedicle screw is a good technique for osteosynthesis. However, the claimed long term advantage of motion segment preservation with this technique remains doubtful. It may be suitable for those fractures with minimal translation (<4 mm), where the superiority of surgery, itself, over external immobilization is questionable. C2-3 fusion is preferable for those fractures with translation >4 mm as these are unstable and C2 pedicle screws alone are likely to have less desirable results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Chitosan and ferroferric oxide are co-precipitated by using an in situ precipitation method, and then lyophilized to get the composite scaffolds. XRD indicated that Fe3O4 was generated during the gel formation process, and increasing the content of magnetic particles could destruct the crystal structure of chitosan. When the content of magnetic particles is lower than 10%, the layer-by-layer structure and wheel spoke structure are coexisting in the scaffolds. Increasing the content of magnetic particles, just layer-by-layer structure could be observed in the scaffolds. Ferroferric oxide particles were uniformly distributed in the matrix, the size of which was about 0.48 mu m in diameter, 2 mu m in length. Porosity of magnetic chitosan composite scaffolds is about 90%. When the ratio of ferroferric oxide to chitosan is 5/100, the compressive strength of the material is 0.4367 MPa, which is much higher than that of pure chitosan scaffolds, indicating that the layer-by-layer and wheel spokes complex structure is beneficial for the improvement of the mechanical properties of chitosan scaffolds. However, increasing the content of ferroferric oxide, the compressive strength of scaffolds decreased, because of the decreasing of chitosan crystallization and aggregation of magnetic particles as stress centralized body. Another reason is that the layer-by-layer and wheel spokes complex structure makes bigger contributions for the compressive strength than the layer-by-layer structure does. Three-dimensional ferroferric oxide/chitosan scaffolds could be used as hyperthermia generator system, improving the local circulation of blood, promoting the aggradation of calcium salt and stimulating bone tissue regeneration.

Effect of scapular pillar anatomy on scapular impingement in adduction and rotation after reverse shoulder arthroplasty	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Shoulder; Total reverse shoulder arthroplasty; Scapular pillar; Notching; Glenosphere offset	HUMERAL COMPONENT RETROVERSION; OPTIMIZING GLENOSPHERE POSITION; EXTERNAL ROTATION; ABDUCTION RANGE; CUFF TEAR; DESIGN; PROSTHESIS; ARTHRITIS; FIXATION; MOTION	Background: Notching of the scapular pillar is the main radiographic complication seen during follow-up of reverse shoulder arthroplasties. Several recommendations pertaining to the implantation technique and glenoid component design have been suggested. No studies have investigated potential anatomic risk factors for inferior scapular impingement. Hypothesis: A specific anatomic shape of the scapular pillar promotes the development of notching. Materials and methods: The Aequalis Reversed (R) (Tornier Inc., Edina, MN, USA) prosthesis was implanted into 40 cadaver scapulae. We measured maximal range-of-motion (ROM) in internal rotation, external rotation, and adduction. The anatomic specimens were then imaged using two-dimensional computed tomography (CT) and the scapular neck angle, surface area under the scapular pillar, and distance from the central glenosphere peg to the inferior glenoid rim were measured. Associations between these CT parameters and ROM values were assessed using statistical independence tests. Results: ROM values were greatest when the surface area under the scapular pillar was above 0.8 cm(2) (P < 0.5). This feature combined with a scapular neck angle less than 105 degrees produced the largest ROM values (P < 0.5). Discussion: The scapular neck angle alone is not sufficient to identify a scapular morphology that increases the risk of notching. The surface area under the scapular pillar, in contrast, discriminates between scapulae with and without a high risk of notching. The surface area under the scapular pillar is influenced by the inferior glenoid offset. Conclusion: We were unable to define a specific scapular shape at high risk for notching. The prevention of notching should rely chiefly on a rigorous glenoid component implantation technique, with particular attention to the inferior offset. Level of evidence: III, experimental study.

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for impaired fracture healing in geriatric trauma patients with TFF following surgical treatment with a femoral nail. Methods:This retrospective cohort study included geriatric trauma patients (aged > 70 years) with TFF who were treated with femoral nailing. Fractures were classified according to AO/OTA. Nonunion was defined as lack of callus-formation after 6 months, material breakage, and requirement of revision surgery. Risk factors for nonunion included variables of clinical interest (injury pattern, demographics, comorbidities), as well as type of approach (open versus closed) and were assessed with uni- and multivariate regression analyses. Results:This study included 225 geriatric trauma patients. Nonunion was significantly more frequently following AO/OTA 31A3 fractures (N = 10, 23.3%) compared with AO/OTA type 31A2 (N = 6, 6.9%) or AO/OTA 31A1 (N = 3, 3.2%, p < 0.001). Type 31A3 fractures had an increased risk for nonunion compared with type 31A1 (OR 10.3 95%CI 2.2 to 48.9, p = 0.003). Open reduction was not associated with increased risk for nonunion (OR 0.9, 95%CI 0.1 to 6.1. p = 0.942) as was not the use of cerclage (OR 1.0, 95%CI 0.2 to 6.5, p = 0.995). Factors such as osteoporosis, polytrauma or diabetes were not associated with delayed union or nonunion. Conclusion:The fracture morphology of TFF is an independent risk factor for nonunion in geriatric patients. The reduction technique is not associated with increased risk for nonunion, despite increased soft tissue damage following open reduction.

However, few studies reported the results of osteoporotic complex fracture. This study aimed to demonstrate the stress distribution pattern, particularly in osteoporotic 3-part proximal humerus fractures involving greater tuberosity (GT) with different screw configurations. Materials and methods: Using the computed tomography (CT) images of 2 patients, who had osteoporosis and the other had normal bone density, 3-part fractures involving the GT, without medial support were reconstructed. To reflect the osteoporosis or real bone density, Hounsfield unit of CT scans were utilized. A force of 200 N was applied in 30' varus direction. The proximal screws were set in 2 ways: 6 screws without inferomedial supporting screws and 9 screws with inferomedial supporting screws. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of internal stress distribution were performed. Results: The most proximal part area near humeral head vertex and near the 1st screw's passage and tip had more stress concentrated in osteoporotic 3-part fractures. The stress distribution around the proximal screws was found near the GT fracture line and its lateral side, where the local max values located. Inferomedial supporting screws decreased these effects by changing the points to medial side from the GT. The ratio in osteoporotic bone model decreased to that in normal bone model when inferomedial supporting screws were applied (normal bone, 2.97%-1.30%; osteoporosis bone, 4.76%-1.71%). Conclusions: In osteoporotic 3-part proximal humerus fracture, the stress distribution was concentrated on the area near the humeral vertex, 1st row screw tips, and lateral side region from the GT fracture line. Moreover, inferomedial supporting screws ensured that the stress distribution is similar to that in normal bone setting, particularly in osteoporotic condition.

Outcomes of distal humerus fractures: What are we measuring?	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Distal humerus fracture; Journal impact factor; Outcome measures; Patient-reported outcome instruments	TOTAL ELBOW ARTHROPLASTY; FORM HEALTH SURVEY; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES; QUESTIONNAIRE; RELIABILITY; DISABILITIES; QUICKDASH; SHOULDER	Introduction: We evaluate the most common outcome measures used in distal humerus fracture studies in order to suggest standardization for future research. Materials and methods: A systematic review identified articles assessing the outcomes of acute distal humerus fractures from 2006 to 2016 from PubMed and Web of Science databases. The inclusion criterion was studies reporting on the outcomes of treatment of acute distal humerus fractures. Review articles, meta-analyses, studies with < 5 patients, technique articles, biomechanical studies, and those focusing on one complication/outcome were excluded. Patient demographics and all outcome measures were reviewed. Journal and demographic factors were then compared. Results: One-hundred-nine of 2158 articles met inclusion criteria. The median number of fractures per study was 35. Mean patient age was 55.0 years. Average follow-up was 35 months. Range-of-motion and strength measurements were reported in 90% and 17% of studies, respectively. Twenty patientreported outcome instruments were used. The most commonly reported measures were MEPS, DASH, VAS pain, and Quick DASH scores. An average of 1.9 outcome measures were reported per study. A journal impact factor of >= 1.5 was associated with more reported outcome measures. Articles including elbow arthroplasty were associated with higher impact factor journals, more outcome measures, and longer follow-up. Level of evidence was not associated with the number of reported outcome measures. Discussion: The current distal humerus fracture literature inconsistently reports outcome measures. More outcome measures were reported in higher impact journals. Future distal humerus fracture studies should include MEPS, DASH or Quick DASH, and VAS Pain scores to allow for appropriate cross-study comparison. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The standard approach is delta-pectoral, but few data using the minimally invasive anterolateral delta-split approach exist. The aim of the study was to prospectively evaluate shoulder function and radiological outcome after a minimally invasive antero-lateral delta-split approach. Materials and methods: From December 2007 to October 2010, 124 patients with proximal humerus fractures were treated with locking-plate osteosynthesis using a minimally invasive antero-lateral delta-split approach. Complete prospective clinical and radiographic data were available for 97 patients for a minimum 1-year follow-up period. Results: After a follow-up period of 18 +/- 6 months, the patients achieved a mean absolute Constant score of the injured shoulder of 75 +/- 11, equalling 91% of the contralateral shoulder Constant score (p < 0.01). Implant-related complications (e. g., screw perforation) were observed in seven patients (7.2%), and avascular necrosis occurred in eight patients (8.2%). Damage to the ventral branch of the axillary nerve was recorded in four cases (4%) without any clinical consequences. The mean delay between trauma and surgery was 0.5 days. The procedures were performed by a total of 16 surgeons who required an average of 73 +/- 27 min of OR time and 108 +/- 121 s of fluoroscopy time. Conclusions: Minimally invasive osteosynthesis using angle-stable implants for proximal humerus fractures demonstrated good functional results. Compared to the literature, this minimally invasive procedure resulted in a shorter operation time and may have reduced the avascular necrosis rate. Level of evidence: Level IIb, monocentric prospective cohort study. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to conduct an 8-year prospective analysis of OMFT cases from an emergency service. Materials and Methods A hospital-based 8-year prospective study on OMFT and associated factors was performed on data from December 2011 to December 2019. Data regarding sociodemographic (gender, age, and skin color) and socio-economic profiles (educational level, family income, and occupation), OMFT profile (etiology, OMFT type, and treatment), associated factors [alcohol consumption and personal protective equipment (PPE) use], OMFT occurrence (injury day and hour), length of hospital stay, and cost were collected. Descriptive and inferential analyses of data were performed. Results Most OMFT cases involved men with low schooling and family income, resulting from traffic accidents. OMFT severity was associated with longer hospital stay, higher hospital costs and nonuse of PPE, midface fractures (mainly orbital-zygomatic fractures), closed reduction, and open reduction/internal fixation. Traffic accidents were the main cause of longer hospital stays for victims aged 41-60 years with better socio-economic status compared with cases that had higher hospital costs. In general, higher hospital costs were associated with victims of violence under 40 years of age, with low schooling and farmers. Alcohol consumption and non-use of PPE also contributed to increasing the length of hospital stay. Conclusion Oral and maxillofacial trauma severity was associated with longer hospital stay and higher hospital costs. Associated factors such as alcohol consumption and non-use of PPE contributed to increase the length of hospital stay and OMFT severity.

For that, cementitious mortars were manufactured with recycled or lightweight fine aggregates added in two conditions: saturated and dried before the mortar preparation. They were incorporated in partial replacement of the natural aggregate. As well, 8.5% and 100% of electroplating sludge (liquid) in relation to the total water content in the mortars were replaced, to assess the fixation of contaminants. For this, were determined the physical properties of aggregates (density, absorption, compliance test, and others), then the mortars were prepared and evaluated for consistency, absorption by immersion, mechanical strength, leaching and others. The results showed that the LWA and RCA presented 99.9 and 96.7% efficiency in Pb adsorption, receptively. Also, for Zn, the RCA presented 98% efficiency in adsorption in the solutions. The cement consumption was reduced, on average, from 490 kg m(-3) with NA to 470 kg m(-3) with RCA and to 405 kg m(-3) with LWA. The leaching test of the mortars showed that 100% of the Cr and Ni from the solution was adsorbed by the mortars. In the compliance tests, the Cr metal was not leached from the crushed mortars, and in the partial-added mortars, zinc was leached in less quantity in comparison with the reference series (48% less, on average). The results show that the incorporation of electroplating sludge in mortars did not alter their properties, as well as the replacement of 25% of the natural aggregate by recycled aggregate. Finally, the recycled aggregate can be used to partially replace the natural aggregate, increasing its potential for use and without causing damage to the final material. As well as the recycled and lightweight aggregate proved to be an effective chemical sorbent for the studied electroplating residue.

The objective of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes and complications between the locking compression plate (LCP) and LCP with fibular allograft in the treatment of patients with displaced proximal humerus fracture (PHF) in elderly people. Material and Methods. Between January 2010 and December 2013, a total of 97 elderly patients with displaced PHF were treated by LCP or LCP with fibular allograft, and finally 89 patients were included in our study. All the patients were divided into Group I (patients treated by LCP) and Group II (patients treated by LCP with fibular allograft). Function results were assessed by the disability of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASI I) score and Constant-Murley score (CMS), and complications were also recorded in each group. Results. 'I he average follow-up was 35.2 months (range, 24-48 months) in Group I and 33.5 months (range, 24-48 months) in Group II. DASH in patients of Group I was significantly higher than that in patients in Group II and patients of Group I had CMS scores significantly lower than patients in Group II (P<0.05). The rates of varus malunion, screw perforation, and loss of reduction>5mm were significantly higher in Group I than in Group II (P<0.05). Conclusions. The present results showed that that patients treated by LCP with fibular allograft had a better functional outcome and a lower complication rate compared to patients treated by LCP alone. Suitable void filler in the proximal humerus for supporting the head fragment, medial cortical bone, and greater tuberosity might play a key role in reducing the incidence of the complications in elderly patients, especially with osteoporosis.

Outcome of Schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Tibial plateau fractures; dual plates; ring fixators		Background: Schatzker type V and VI tibial fractures are complex injuries, usually treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using dual plates or ring fixators. ORIF has the advantage of not requiring pin tract care, but has a higher infection rate, especially in open fractures. We have combined the advantages of these two methods to treat these difficult fractures. Materials and Methods: Ten Schatzker type V and 11 Schatzker type VI fractures were treated between 2006 and 2010. ORIF with dual plates was performed, only if there was marked articular displacement (>2 mm) in a closed fracture. All other fractures including open fractures and closed fractures with soft tissue compromise or minimal articular displacement were treated with ring fixators. The outcomes were analyzed and documented using the Honkonen and Jarvinen subjective, clinical, functional, and radiological criteria and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC). Results: Nine closed fractures with marked articular displacement (>2 mm) were treated with dual plates. Eight closed fractures with minimal articular displacement (<2 mm) and poor skin condition and four open fractures were treated with ring fixators. The mean follow-up period was 2 1/2 years. The mean postoperative knee flexion was 128 degrees. All patients could walk, jump, and climb steps. 90% could squat, though only 50% could duck walk properly. Radiologically, 85% had a plateau tilt of less than 5, 92% had an articular step of less than 2 mm, and a residual articular widening of less than 5 mm. There were no major infections. Two patients had minor pin tract infections and two requested that their plates be removed subsequently. Conclusion: The protocol used to treat Schatzker type V and VI tibial plateau fractures has had excellent results and we suggest that all open fractures be treated with ring fixators and that ORIF should be done only for closed fractures with marked displacement.

J	Rak, V; Ira, D; Masek, M				Rak, Vaclav; Ira, Daniel; Masek, Michal			Operative treatment of intra-articular calcaneal fractures with calcaneal plates and its complications	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Calcaneal plate; intra-articular calcaneal fracture; lateral extensile approach	PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; NONOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT; CLASSIFICATION	Background: In a retrospective study we analysed intra-articular calcaneal fracture treatment by comparing results and complications related to fracture stabilization with nonlocking calcaneal plates and locking compression plates. Materials and Methods: We performed 76 osteosynthesis (67 patients) of intra-articular calcaneal fractures using the standard extended lateral approach from February 2004 to October 2007. Forty-two operations using nonlocking calcaneal plates (group A) were performed during the first three years, and 34 calcaneal fractures were stabilized using locking compression plates (group B) in 2007. In the Sanders type IV fractures, reconstruction of the calcaneal shape was attempted. Depending on the type of late complication, we performed subtalar arthroscopy in six cases, arthroscopically assisted subtalar distraction bone block arthrodesis in six cases, and plate removal with lateral-wall decompression in five cases. The patients were evaluated by the AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Scale. Results: Wound healing complications were 7/42 (17) in group A and 1/34 (3) in group B. No patient had deep osseous infection or foot rebound compartment syndrome. Preoperative size of B phi hlers angle correlated with postoperative clinical results in both groups. There were no late complications necessitating corrective procedure or arthroscopy until December 2008 in Group B. All late complications ccurred in Group A. The overall results according to the AOFAS Ankle Hindfoot Scale were good or excellent in 23/42 (55) in group A and in 30/34 (85) in group B. Conclusion: Open reduction and internal fixation of intra-articular calcaneal fractures has become a standard surgical method. Fewer complications and better results related to treatment with locking compression plates confirmed in comparison to nonlocking ones were noted for all Sanders types of intra-articular calcaneal fractures. Age and Sanders type IV fractures are not considered to be the contraindications to surgery.

Posterior thoracolumbar spine implants retrieved as part of routine clinical practice over a 2-year period were analyzed to identify wear and corrosion. Objective. Engineering analyses of retrieved posterior instrumentation for indications of performance and failure and correlation of this information with clinical factors. Summary of Background Data. Recent studies have reported spinal instrumentation particulate wear debris and have noted the importance of design considerations at implant connector interfaces. Methods. A total of 57 implants were analyzed from patients (39 female, 18 male) whose average age at implantation was 43.9 years (range, 13.7-77.4 years). Time of implantation ranged from 2 months to 13.5 years. The top 3 implantation diagnoses were radiculopathy (33%), scoliosis (30%), and back pain (25%). Metallurgical analyses were performed to characterize the wear and/or corrosion, and fractures of the implants. Results. Wear was present in 75%, corrosion in 39%, and fractures in 7% of the retrieved implants. Wear and/or corrosion was more prevalent, with respect to the total number of implants retrieved, in implants that had been in service at least 1 year. There was no evidence of corrosion in any of the Ti implants, whereas corrosion was present (with wear) in 58% of the stainless steel (SS) implants. Wear and corrosion were more frequently observed in long rods than in short rods. Implantation times were longer for SS implants than for Ti implants. Conclusions. Retrieved rods exhibited corrosion, wear, and fracture, with wear and corrosion mainly located at the interfaces with hooks, screws, or cross-connectors. The mechanisms causing this material loss in situ, as well as what local or systemic responses it may stimulate are of clinical significance and should be studied further.

Tape suture constructs for instabilities of the pubic symphysis: is the idea of motion preservation a suitable treatment option? A cadaver study	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Pelvic instability; Biomechanics; Minimally invasive; Flexible osteosynthesis; Tape suture; Pubic symphysis	INTERNAL-FIXATION; FAILURE	Introduction Current gold standard for the treatment of symphyseal disruptions includes anterior plating, almost entirely prohibiting symphyseal mobility and resulting in an iatrogenic arthrodesis followed by high rates of implant failure. Minimally invasive tape suture constructs have been found to maintain the micro mobility of ligamentous injuries, yet still providing sufficient biomechanical stability. Recently, this technique has been primarily investigated for symphyseal disruptions on synthetic pelvic models. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of this novel flexible osteosynthesis on cadaveric pelvic models based on the following hypothesis: tape suture constructs ensure sufficient biomechanical stability without inhibiting micro mobility of the pubic symphysis for the treatment of symphyseal disruptions and maintain stability during long-term loading. Materials and methods 9 cadaveric anterior pelvic rings were used in this study and a symphyseal disruption was created in every specimen. The specimens were then exposed to short- and long-term vertical and horizontal cyclic loading after treatment with a tape suture construct in criss-cross technique. The mean maximum displacement (mm) during cyclic loading and the corresponding stiffness (N/mm) were measured and compared. Results Regarding both displacement (mm) and corresponding stiffness (N/mm), the tape sutures displayed a significant difference between short- and long-term loading for cranial and caudal vertical loading (p < 0.01) but differences remained non-significant for horizontal loading (p > 0.05). No tape suture suffered from implant failure during long-term loading. Conclusions The tape suture construct displayed sufficient biomechanical stability without exceeding the physiological mobility of 2 mm of the pubic symphysis; however, also maintained the desired micro mobility of the affected joint necessary to prevent an iatrogenic arthrodesis. Further, all tape sutures maintained stability throughout long-term loading.

MATERIAL and METHODS: Twelve patients with posttraumatic paraplegia and severe angular kyphosis (>60 degrees) had undergone PVCR between 6-24 months after the trauma for severe pain, persistent vertebral instability and difficulty in adherence to rehabilitation. ASIA scores and SRS-22 questionnaire results obtained in the preoperative and postoperative periods, and the last control were statistically compared to assess the presence of any change. RESULTS: The average age of twelve patients included in this study was 35.6 +/- 10.2 (21-51) years. Female/male ratio was 2/10 (20.0%). The mean follow-up duration was 50.3 +/- 17.6 (24-86) months. None of the patients had additional changes in neuromonitoring records during surgery. The mean preoperative kyphotic angle of the patients was 66.58 degrees +/- 7.1 degrees (60 degrees-82 degrees) which decreased to 7.0 degrees +/- 5.4 degrees in the postoperative period (p<0.05). The mean ASIA score, which was 43.3 +/- 5.1 preoperatively, increased to 44.4 +/- 4.4 in the postoperative period. The SRS-22 score, which was 2.4 +/- 0.3 in the preoperative period, increased to 4.2 +/- 0.4 in the early postoperative period. This increase was found to be statistically significant (p<0.05). The SRS-22 score was 4.1 +/- 0.4 at last follow-up and was not statistically different from the early postoperative value (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: In the light of these data, it can be stated that PVCR is a safe and reliable procedure in paraplegic patients with rigid posttraumatic kyphosis and increases patient satisfaction.

Objectives: To evaluate the accuracy of the caliper method of hemiarthroplasty head sizing by comparing it to the native joint congruency (JC) at the weight bearing surface. Materials and methods: The diameters of femoral heads in 10 cadaver hip joints were measured by using a caliper at the head equator. Cast moulds were prepared from both the acetabulum and the femoral head in each joint. Every mould's exact spherical diameter at the weight bearing region was measured by a computerised coordinate measuring machine (MNC B231 MITUTOYO). All specimens were coded to ensure that future examination was carried out in a blind manner. Native JC mismatch was determined by subtracting the diameter of the femoral cement mould from that of the acetabular one. Similarly, JC mismatch was calculated for the caliper measurements. Results: The average native JC mismatch (0.36 +/- 0.29 mm, range 0.03-0.82 mm, median 0.29 mm) was found significantly smaller (p = 0.03) than following caliper measurements (0.72 +/- 0.37 mm, range 0.37-1.46 mm, median 0.6 mm). Routine caliper measured downward size rounding enhanced (p = 0.004) this mismatch (0.98 +/- 0.44 mm, range 0.37-1.96 mm, median 1.01 mm), while upward rounding (0.48 +/- 0.46 mm, range -0.06 to 1.15 mm, median 0.41 mm) helped mitigate this tendency. Conclusions: Caliper measurements tend to undersize the actual sphere diameter of the femoral head at the weight bearing region. Upward rounded prosthesis should be selected in order to compensate for this propensity. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Those fractures lead to high costs and a decrease in quality of life. A national French survey was conducted, with the objectives to firstly assess the current management of hip fracture and its prevention, both in the osteoporotic and cancer settings, and secondly to evaluate the opinions of physicians on the potential use of minimally invasive implantable devices to prevent hip fracture in alternative of surgery.Materials and methods: This national survey was conducted in France between April and July 2017. Questionnaires were sent to orthopedic surgeons, interventional radiologists, oncologists, and rheumatologists. Completed questionnaires were analyzed and compared according to two indications: orthopedics-traumatology and oncology. Factors associated with these responses were assessed using univariable analyses, based on chi-square tests or an exact Fisher test, as appropriate.Results: A total of 182 questionnaires were completed and further analyzed. Physicians have highlighted the need for a low re-fracture rate and to improve life expectancy for more than 1 year (50% for responders of the orthopedics-traumatology questionnaire and 80% for the responders interested in both indications), as well as quality of life (12.5% and 31%, respectively), but with no significant differences in the oncologic indication. Most of the experts were willing to use or prescribe implantable devices for prevention (63% in orthopedics-traumatology and 93% in oncology), although limited clinical experience (54 and 58%) and surgical risk (around 30% in each indication) were considered as limits.Conclusions:Prevention of hip fracture remains a concern for physicians. More clinical experience with implantable devices, in particular in cancer patients, is needed, but implemented in a strategy to maximize patient recovery while reducing costs.

The GF/SF/CTS hybrid composite possesses a unique sandwich structure and comprises GF/CTS/epoxy as the external layers and SF/CTS/epoxy as the inner layers. The composite plate resembles the human bone structure (spongy internal cancellous matrix and rigid external cortical). The mechanical properties of the prepared hybrid sandwich composites samples were evaluated using tensile, flexural, micro hardness, and compression tests. The scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images were studied to analyze the failure mechanism of these composite samples. Besides, contact angle (CA) and water absorption tests were conducted using the sessile drop method to examine the wettability properties of the SF/CTS/epoxy and GF/SF/CTS/epoxy composites. Additionally, the porosity of the GF/SF/CTS composite scaffold samples were determined by using the ethanol infiltration method. The mechanical test results show that the GF/SF/CTS hybrid composites exhibit the bending strength of 343 MPa, ultimate tensile strength of 146 MPa, and compressive strength of 380 MPa with higher Young's modulus in the bending tests (21.56 GPa) compared to the tensile (6646 MPa) and compressive modulus (2046 MPa). Wettability study results reveal that the GF/SF/CTS composite scaffolds were hydrophobic (CA = 92.41 degrees +/- 1.71 degrees) with less water absorption of 3.436% compared to the SF/CTS composites (6.953%).

RSA allows a good anterior elevation but rotational results are more random and depend on tuberosity healing. Hypothesis: Use of an offset modular system (OMS) on the prothesis improve tuberosity healing and functional results. Material and methods: This retrospective cohort analysed radiological and clinical outcomes at least one year after the use of RSA Humelock II Reversed (Fx Solutions) after a displaced PHF Neer 3 or 4 in patients over 70 years. The first criterion was tuberosity healing with or without the use of the OMS device on radiographs. The second criterion was a clinical analysis of active range of motion (ROM), anterior elevation (AAE), external and internal rotations (ER, IR), Constant, DASH, SSV, VAS scores according to tuberosity healing. We also analysed radiological and clinical complications. Results: We analysed from November 2013 to May 2018 thirty-four RSA. Mean age was 78 +/- 5,7 years, mean follow up was 18 +/- 7,2 months and the mean tuberosity healing rate was 79%. Mean ROM were: 117 +/- 24 (AAE), 18 degrees +/- 18 (ER) and L2 (IR). On the first analysis, healing tuberosity with cage was present on 24 (92%) patients versus 3 (37,5%) without (p < 0,005). The second analysis showed a non-significant improvement on ER, IR, Constant, DASH and SSV. Complications found were three removal of prothesis after infection, one axillary nerve lesion, one ulnar paraesthesia and one humeral loosening. Conclusion: The use of the OMS cage allows a better consolidation of tuberosities in a significant way but no significant clinical effects was highlighted due to a small patient number in the study.

Functional and quality of life outcome after non-operatively managed proximal humeral fractures	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS AND TRAUMATOLOGY			English	Article						Fracture; Proximal humerus; Conservative treatment; Functional outcome; Quality of life; DASH; EQ-5D	INTERNAL-FIXATION; HEALTH-STATUS; SHOULDER; PLATE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; DISABILITIES; RELIABILITY; VALIDITY; STATES; EQ-5D	Background Fractures of the proximal humerus are common and most often treated non-operatively. However, long-term follow-up studies focusing on functional results and quality of life in patients after this type of fracture are scarce. The primary aim of this study is to report the long-term functional and quality of life outcome in patients with a proximal humeral fracture. Materials and methods A retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients undergoing non-operative treatment for a proximal humeral fracture in a level 2 trauma centre between January 2000 and December 2013 was performed. A database consisting of all relevant demographic, patient and fracture characteristics was created. Subsequently, a questionnaire containing the DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) score, EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), VAS (visual analogue scale) score, and subjective questions was sent to all patients. Results A total of 410 patients (65 male, 345 female) were included for analyses. Average follow-up was 90 +/- 48 months. DASH-scores <15 were considered as good. A median DASH-score of 6.67 [0.83-22.50] was found. A significant lower DASH-score was seen in patients under the age of 65 compared to older patients (p < 0.001). In comparison to an age-matched general Dutch population, Health related Quality of Life (HrQoL) on the EQ-us was not significantly worse in our study population (difference 0.02). Strong (negative) correlation was found between DASH-score and VAS-score, and DASH-score and HrQoL, respectively rho = -0.534 and rho = -0.787. Conclusion Long-term functional and quality of life outcomes are good in most patients after proximal humeral fractures, but negatively correlated to each other.

Nevertheless, if a nonunion occurs, complex revision procedures usually become necessary. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a series of aseptic trochanteric nonunions in patients aged 60 years or older, looking at outcomes regarding healing rate, implant-related complications and secondary surgeries. Material and Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with aseptic femoral trochanteric nonunions aged over 60 years. Nonunion treatment consisted of implant removal, debridement of the nonunion, and restoration of the neck shaft angle, followed by DCS plating. An additional 4.5-mm limited contact dynamic compression plate was placed in twelve patients anteriorly. The primary outcome measure was bony healing and time to healing in months. Secondary outcome measures included postoperative complications related to the index procedure, range of motion of the affected hip and postoperative mobility. Results: A total of 21 patients with a mean age of 69.1 years met the inclusion criteria. After a mean follow-up of 21.62 months, 17 of the 21 nonunions healed successfully. The mean healing time was 6.59 months. A total of six of the 21 patients needed secondary revision surgery. At the final follow-up, a full range of motion of the hip was seen in 17 of the 21 hips. Conclusions: DCS treatment and preservation of the patient's femoral head can be successful for patients aged over 60 years with a well-preserved femoral head and acetabulum. However, preservation of the hip joint and revision plating might be associated with higher revision rates. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, delayed surgery postpones definitive diagnosis and prolongs the period of disability. We have treated pathologic fractures in a single stage through a modified lateral surgical approach with curettage of the tumor and stabilization using injectable calcium sulfate cement. The aim of this study was to report the outcomes of treatment with this material and the modified approach. Methods Between 2006 and 2010, we enrolled 8 patients with solitary hand enchondromas and pathologic fractures. The surgical procedure involved a lateral approach, an extended lateral cortical window, thorough tumor evacuation, and reconstruction of the bone defects using commercially available injectable calcium sulfate cement. We performed evaluations before surgery and in the postoperative follow-up series by radiographs and clinical assessments, including measurement of joint motion by goniometry and a visual analog pain scale. Results The average time of follow-up was 19 months (range, 12-36 mo). The pathologic fractures of all patients healed clinically and radiographically within 8 weeks after surgery, and the mean active motion arcs of the metacarpophalangeal joints and proximal interphalangeal joints of the involved digit were 90 degrees and 94 degrees, respectively at 3-month follow-up. All patients returned to ordinary daily activities without obvious pain by 3 months postoperatively. We found no major complications, such as unacceptable alignment, nonunion, infection, or tumor recurrence, during follow-up. Conclusions This study demonstrated the outcomes of early management of phalangeal enchondromas with pathologic fractures using a lateral approach and injectable calcium sulfate cement for reconstruction. This combined approach avoided the need for supplemental internal fixation, allowed early mobilization, and resulted in minimal joint stiffness. (J Hand Surg 2013;38A:104-109.

Initial experience on efficacy in closure of cryptoglandular and Crohn's transsphincteric fistulas by the use of the anal fistula plug	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COLORECTAL DISEASE			English	Article						anorectal fistula; cryptoglandular; Crohn's disease; anal fistula plug; success	MUCOSAL ADVANCEMENT FLAP; TERM-FOLLOW-UP; FIBRIN GLUE; IN-ANO; ANORECTAL FISTULAS; REPAIR; ADHESIVE; SEALANT; TRIAL	Background and aims It was the aim of this prospective study to analyze the efficacy of the Cook Surgisis (R) AFP (TM) anal fistula plug (AFP) for the closure of cryptoglandular and Crohn's disease-associated transsphincteric anorectal fistulas. Materials and methods All patients with transsphincteric anorectal fistulas who underwent a surgical procedure using the AFP were prospectively enrolled in this study. Inclusion criteria included transsphincteric, single-tract fistulas. Patients' demographics, fistula etiology, surgical variables, continence (Cleveland Clinic Florida incontinence score), quality of life (fecal incontinence quality of life), and success rates were prospectively recorded. Surgery was performed in a standardized technique including irrigation of the fistula tract, placement, and internal fixation of the Cook Surgisis (R) AFP (TM) anal fistula plug. No flap or excision of the fistula tract was performed. Success was defined as closure of both internal and external openings, absence of drainage without further intervention, and absence of abscess formation. Follow-up information was derived from clinical examination 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postoperatively. Results Within 6 months (August 2006 to January 2007), a total of 19 AFPs were inserted in 19 patients (8 females, 11 males; mean age, 38 years). Out of 19 patients, 12 had cryptoglandular and 7 had Crohn's associated transsphincteric fistulas. Three patients were smokers, one patient had methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection. Mean operative time was 15 min (range, 8-22); no morbidity occurred. After a mean follow-up of 279 days (SD = 68.0) and one patient lost to follow-up, the overall success rate was 61% (12 of 18) at 9 months postoperatively. Focusing solely on cryptoglandular fistulas, the success rate was 45.5% (5 of 11), whereas it was 85.7% (6 of 7) in transsphincteric fistulas associated with Crohn's disease. Five patients with failure of AFP (plug dislodgement, n = 2; persistent secretion, n = 3) had reoperation (27.8%). The reasons for failure were infection requiring drainage (n = 2) and persistent drainage (n = 3). No deterioration of continence was documented. Conclusion The success rate for the Cook Surgisis (R) AFP (TM) anal fistula plug for the closure of complex anorectal fistulas both in cryptoglandular and Crohn's associated fistulas was 45.5 and 85.7%, respectively. Further analysis is needed to explain the definite role of this innovative technique in comparison to traditional surgical techniques.	[Schwandner, O.; Stadler, F.; Dietl, O.; Wirsching, R.

J	Frich, LH; Jensen, NC				Frich, Lars Henrik; Jensen, Niels Christian			Bone properties of the humeral head and resistance to screw cutout	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SHOULDER SURGERY			English	Article						Bone architecture; bone strength; humeral head; screw cutout	PROXIMAL HUMERUS; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; CANCELLOUS BONE; TRABECULAR BONE; FRACTURES; PLATE; STRENGTH; SUPPORT	Surgical treatment of fractures involving the proximal humeral head is hampered by complications. Screw cutout is the major pitfall seen in connection with rigid plating. We have exploited a bony explanation for this phenomenon. Materials and Methods: We examined the convex surface of the humeral head looking at the density and the topographical strength of the subchondral bone using mechanical testing of bone cylinders harvested from the humeral head. We also studied the osseous architecture of the subchondral bone and thickness of the boneplate of the humeral head using a 3-dimensional serial sectioning technique. Results: The bone strength and bone density correlated well and revealed large regional variations across the humeral head. Bone strength and stiffness of the trabecular bone came to a maximum in the most medial anterior and central parts of the humeral head, where strong textural anisotropy was also found. We found in particular a lower bone strength and density in the posterior and inferior regions of the humeral head. A rapid decline in bone strength within a few mm below a relatively thin subchondral plate was also reported. Clinical Relevance: We have in this paper explored some of the most important factors connected with screw stability at the cancellous bone level. We discovered large variations in bone density and bone strength across the joint surface rendering certain areas of the humeral head less suitable for screw placement. The use of rigid plate constructs with divergent screw directions will predictably place screws in areas of the humeral head comprising low density and low strength cancellous bone. New concepts of plates and plating techniques for the surgical treatment of complex fractures of the proximal humerus should take bone distribution, strength, and architecture into account.

The purpose of this study was to compare the primary stability of a lateral opening-wedge osteotomy (LOWO) using a uniplanar compared to a biplanar technique. A study was carried out to test both surgeries, with both an intact medial cortex and with a deliberate attached cut of the medial cortex simulating a fracture. The primary hypothesis was that the biplanar technique provides higher axial and torsional stiffness. It was further hypothesized that the mechanical superiority of the biplanar technique would not be affected in the case of breakage of the far medial cortex.MethodsA LOWO was performed in ten synthetic femora (#3406 left large Femur, 4th Generation, Sawbones, Malmo, Sweden) using a lateral angle stable locking plate (NCB (c) Distal Femur Plate, Zimmer Biomet, Warsaw, USA). A uniplanar osteotomy was performed in five femora, and a biplanar osteotomy was performed in five femora. The femora were tested for axial and torsional loads using a servo-hydraulic testing machine (Instron 8874, Instron Structural Testing GmbH, High Wycombe, UK).ResultsAxial stiffness decreased significantly (p=0.001) in both groups (20% in the uniplanar group and 28 % in the biplanar group) by cutting the medial cortex. The type of osteotomy had no significant effect. A slightly lower but not statistically significant axial stiffness was seen in the biplanar group both for intact and broken medial cortices. Internal torsional stiffness dropped by more than 30% for the uniplanar group and almost 24% for the biplanar group when the cortex was cut (p<0.001). No significant change concerning internal torsional stiffness was found between the two groups. External torsional stiffness decreased by 32% for the uniplanar group and 4% for the biplanar group after the cortical cut (p=0.029). No significant change concerning external torsional stiffness was found between the groups, but the biplanar group showed a tendency towards higher values of external torsional stiffness.ConclusionsThe axial and torsional stiffness of the implant-bone construct were not significantly affected by the type of osteotomy performed. Biplanar osteotomy tended to increase external torsional stiffness. In cases of fracture of the medial cortex, biplanar osteotomy significantly reduced the external rotation at the osteotomy and showed a significantly increased external torsional stiffness.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the correlation between impacted lower third molar and mandibular angle fracture complications. Material and methods: All patients presenting with a mandibular angle fracture and at least 2 months follow up were retrospectively included. The following complications were recorded: post-traumatic malocclusion, mouth opening limitation, inferior alveolar nerve hypoesthesia, infection, delayed union, hardware loosening. The patients were divided in two groups: impacted lower third molar or erupted/absent lower third molar. Results: A total of 68 patients were included, lower third molar was impacted in 36 cases and erupted/absent in 32 cases. 40 complications were recorded in 27 patients at 2 months. No statistically significant difference could be found about malocclusion, mouth opening limitation and inferior alveolar nerve hypoesthesia. A lower rate of persistent inferior alveolar nerve hypoesthesia (p = 0.0557) in patients with impacted lower third molar (19.4%) was observed compared to patients without impacted lower third molar (40.6%). There was no occurrence of delayed union and hardware loosening in impacted lower third molar group, whereas 5 delayed unions and 4 hardware loosening were recorded in erupted/absent lower third molar group. Finally, the rate of patients with at least one of the 6 complications is significantly higher in the erupted/absent lower third molar group (17/32, 53.1%) than in the impacted lower third molar group (10/36, 27.8%), p = 0.033. Discussion: The risk of overall complication is decreased when lower third molar is impacted in mandibular angle fracture. This supports the idea of a role of the impacted lower third molar in fracture reduction and stability. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Frail Patients Benefit From Less Invasive Procedures	GERIATRIC ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY & REHABILITATION			English	Article						frailty; periprosthetic fractures; total hip arthroplasty; minimally invasive techniques; frailty index	PERIPROSTHETIC FEMUR FRACTURE; HIP-ARTHROPLASTY; MORTALITY	Purpose: A traumatic periprosthetic fracture (PPF) is a long-term complication of total hip arthroplasty. Treatment options include revision, open reposition and internal fixation (ORIF), and minimally invasive techniques (MITs). To select the optimal surgical procedure, the level of frailty has to be considered, especially in patients with geriatric trauma. The aim of this study is to determine whether a frail patient has a better outcome postoperatively after less invasive treatment. Methods and materials: Sixty-three patients with an PPF were analyzed in this retrospective study. The level of frailty was obtained by the complex fracture frailty index (CFFI). The CFFI combines comorbidities, laboratory tests, physical abilities, social factors, and cognitive functions. Primary outcomes in this study include mortality, minor complications, and 3 major complications (deceased, reoperation or immobility after 1 year). Results: Thirty frail patients had lower survival rates (P = .014) and significantly more major complications with a relative risk of 3.7 (P = .02). In the entire group of 63 patients, there were no significant differences detected in the outcome measures; however, when specified in a subgroup of 30 frail patients according to our CFFI, significant differences were found. Patients treated with MIT had significantly less major and minor complications compared to ORIF and revision. Furthermore, patients treated with ORIF experienced significantly less minor complications than with revision surgery (P = .015). Discussion and conclusion: This study shows that frail patients can be adequately detected using our frailty score CFFI and have a lower survival rate, regardless the type of surgery. Another finding is that for frail patients, more invasive surgery has a negative influence on the outcome of the treatment. Therefore, it is of great importance to assess and use the patient's level of frailty to determine the surgical procedure for a PPF.

We hypothesized that longer nails would reduce fracture site motion compared with short nails and that 2 proximal locking bolts would improve stability compared with 1 proximal locking bolt. Design: Nine pairs of matched human cadaveric femurs were instrumented with 20-cm and 36-cm retrograde intramedullary nails (all 12-mm diameter, Biomet, Warsaw, IN) following reaming to 13 mm. Transverse supracondylar gap (6 mm) osteotomies were created. The femurs were mounted and cyclically tested separately in coronal plane bending and sagittal plane bending on a materials testing system. Fracture site translation was measured using a digital caliper in the respective plane. Setting: Orthopaedic biomaterials laboratory. Results: With 2 proximal locking bolts, average sagittal translation was 7.2 mm and 1.8 mm, respectively, for the 20-cm and 36-cm nails. Coronal translation was 6.3 mm and 4.3 mm, respectively. With a single proximal locking bolt, average sagittal translation was 7.6 mm and 2.2 mm, respectively, for the 20-cm and 36-cm nails. Coronal translation was 13.6 mm and 4.4 mm, respectively. A statistically Significant difference in fracture site translation was found in each pairing by Student t test (P < 0.005), except coronal translation with 2 proximal locking bolts (P = 0.056). Free-body analysis predicts higher local stresses at the proximal interlocks of the shorter nail. Conclusions: Longer nails provide improved initial fracture stability when compared with short retrograde nails for supracondylar femur fractures due to a more stable mechanical interaction between the femoral diaphysis and the nail. A second proximal locking bolt in the long nail provides no additional stability.

Demineralized bone grafts have been used to stimulate fracture union in experimental studies. Bone demineralized with 0.6N hydrochloric acid has shown to retain its osteoinductive capacity. We report the outcome of partially decalcified bone allograft (decal bone) in the treatment of delayed union and atrophic nonunions of bones. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients with clinicoradiological diagnosis of delayed union or atrophic nonunion of long bone fractures were included in this retrospective study. Patients at extreme of ages (<18 years and >60 years), pathological fractures, metabolic bone diseases, infected nonunion, hypertrophic nonunion and those having systemic illness like diabetes mellitus and on drugs that impair fracture healing were excluded from the study. Decal bone was prepared in the bone bank and maintained in Department of Orthopedics. Allografting was done in 20 patients of delayed union (9/20) and atrophic nonunion (11/20) of long bone fractures with mean age of 34 years (range 18-55 years). The bones involved were humerus (8/20), tibia (7/20) and femur (5/20). Fourteen patients underwent treatment in the form of internal fixation and allografting and six patients were operated with osteoperiosteal allografting. Results: Nineteen patients achieved union in mean time of 14.9 weeks range (range 8-20 weeks). Eight patients had serous discharge from the operative site that subsided in 11 days (range 4-21 days). One patient had pus discharge that required repeat debridement and antibiotics for 6 weeks. The fracture healed in 16 weeks. Conclusion: The partially decalcified bone allograft is an effective modality for augmentation of bone healing without complication associated with autograft like donor site morbidity, increased blood loss and increase in the surgical time.

The diagnosis can be done on routine radiographs, but it is difficult to fully define the geographic extent of these injuries. This study examined the pattern and extent of an injury shown by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and radionuclide bone scan (RBS) in patients whose plain radiographs revealed fractures limited to the GT. Materials and methods Between July 2004 and October 2008, 25 patients who displayed an isolated GT fracture on plain radiograph examination were examined by both MRI and RBS due to a suspicion of an extension into the intertrochanteric (ITC) region. The patients were then divided into two groups. Group A patients had an isolated fracture of GT, and group B patients had an occult fracture of ITC. Results All 25 cases were caused by a low-energy injury and plain radiographs showed non-displaced or minimally displaced isolated GT fractures. For 22 of the 25 patients, the result agreed with MRI and RBS. However, three patients had focal increased uptake at the GT region only according to RBS and an extension of signal intensity into the ITC region according to MRI. Group A and B comprised 5 and 20 patients, respectively. Of the group B patients, 8 had fractures with MRI evidence of complete extension across the ITC region and 12 had incomplete extension. Eleven of the 12 incomplete types showed an extension more than half way to the medial cortex. Fifteen group B patients underwent an internal fixation using a two-hole dynamic hip screw. Conclusion Patients with an isolated fracture of GT can have a broader fracture extending into the ITC region than that diagnosed by standard radiographs. We recommend that all patients presenting with an isolated GT fracture on the plain radiographs should undergo MRI examination.

Acetabular erosion after bipolar hip hemiarthroplasty for femoral neck fracture in elderly patients: a retrospective study	HIP INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Acetabular erosion; hemiarthroplasty; hip fracture	DISPLACED SUBCAPITAL FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; INDEPENDENT PATIENTS; THOMPSON HEMIARTHROPLASTY; INTRACAPSULAR FRACTURE; ARTHROPLASTY; REPLACEMENT; FEMUR; MOBILE; RISK	Background: The choice between total hip arthroplasty (THA) and hemiarthroplasty (HA) to treat displaced femoral neck fractures, particularly among the elderly, is still controversial. Acetabular erosion consists of a late multifactorial process that may happen after hip HA resulting in significant postoperative burden. This study aims to investigate the impact of acetabular erosion progress after hip HA in patients over 70 years old.Materials and methods: This is a 5-year (2013-2018) retrospective study including consecutive series of patients >70 years who were treated with bipolar hip HA for femoral neck fractures. Patients were categorised into 3 groups for analysis (A = 70-75 years, B = 75-80 years, C = >80 years). The study enrolled a total number of 813 patients who met the inclusion criteria. We assessed acetabular erosion through radiological examinations and measured functional deterioration using the modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS) at 6 and 12 months follow-up. Our comprehensive investigation extended over a maximum period of 5 years. The correlation of patients' characteristics and HA features on erosion progress was assessed.Results: There were no significant differences in sex distribution, injury side, BMI, ASA score, bipolar head diameter, mHHS and leg-length discrepancy among the groups (p > 0.05). During the follow-up period, acetabular erosion with consequential conversion to THA was observed in 6.13%, 4.22% and 1.96% for Groups A, B and C respectively (p = 0.009). A statistically significant difference of acetabular erosion was observed in Group A compared to patients of Group C.Conclusions: Age constitutes a significant factor of acetabular wear after HA in the elderly. The higher rate of acetabular wear in patients <75 years suggests that THA is a more viable option, as HA is for patients >80 years old.

Concerns for perioperative blood loss dictate cessation of anticoagulation treatment and postponement of surgery until the coagulation system returns to normal state. The goal of this study is to compare the estimates of perioperative blood loss and mortality between patients using DOACs and patients receiving no anticoagultaion, in order to challenge the existing policy and question the need for surgery deferral. Materials and methods: This is a retrospective cohort of patients (age > 65) with proximal hip fractures treated with either closed reduction internal fixation (CRIF, n = 1143; DOAC use n = 60) or hemiarthroplasty (HA, n = 571; DOAC use n = 29). Baseline patient characteristics included age, gender, ASA score, socioeconomic level, type of surgica#1: In general a l treatment, duration of surgery and time from admission to surgery. The effect of anticoagulant prescription on percentage of hemoglobin change, odds of receiving blood transfusions and one-month and one-year mortality was evaluated separately for CRIF and HA patients. Results: Patients receiving DOACs had similar perioperative hemoglobin change, transfusion rates and mortality, compared to subjects without anticoagulants in both CRIF and HA cohorts. DOAC patients undergoing CRIF had a longer delay to surgery (40.2 +/- 26.9 vs 31.2 +/- 22.2, p = 0.003) and higher mortality rates at one year postoperatively (26.7% vs 16.1%, p = 0.015). Conclusions: DOAC use was not associated with an increased perioperative blood loss or mortality compared to controls. However, they had to wait longer for surgery, which itself was an independent predictor of mortality. It may be safe to shorten waiting time for surgery in patients using anticoagulation, with the goal to minimize surgery delay. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SOFCOT	Total elbow arthroplasty for acute distal humeral fractures in patients over 65 years old - Results of a multicenter study in 87 patients	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Distal humerus fracture; Total elbow arthroplasty; Osteoporosis	INTERNAL-FIXATION; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; COMPLEX FRACTURES; OPEN REDUCTION; REPLACEMENT	Introduction: Fractures of the distal humerus represent 5% of osteoporosis fragility fractures in subjects over the age of 60. Osteoporosis, comorbidities and intra-articular comminution make management of this entity difficult. Hypothesis: The hypothesis was that total elbow arthroplasty could be a reliable treatment option in subjects over the age of 65 presenting with a fracture of the distal humerus. Materials and methods: Eight-seven patients (80 women and 7 men) mean age 79 years old (65-93) underwent total elbow arthroplasty for the treatment of an AO type A fracture in 9 cases, type B in 8 and type C in 70. Results: After a mean follow-up of 37.5 months (6-106) the Mayo Elbow Performance Score MEPS was 86 +/- 14, the quick-DASH score was 24 +/- 19 and the Katz score was 5 +/- 1.5 points. The MEPS was better in patients with a high preoperative Katz score and a history of inflammatory arthritis who were living at home. Fifty-five patients (63%) presented with a pain-free elbow, and 20 (24%) with slight pain. The flexion-extension range of motion was 97 +/- 22 degrees and 48% presented with a flexion-extension arc of at least 100.. Function was normal in 69 patients. Complications were identified in 20 cases (23%) and revision surgery was necessary in 8 (9%). Two arthroplasties had to be changed, one for a fracture of the humeral stem component and the other for loosening. Only one infection occurred in this series. Conclusion: Total elbow arthroplasties provide fractured patients with immediate satisfactory results and a stable, painless and functional elbow. These results seem to be reliable and durable. The rate of complications is low with revision surgery in approximately 10%. Level of evidence: Level IV. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.	[Mansat, P.; Degorce, H.

Technique to minimize paraspinal muscle atrophy after posterior cervical fusion	CLINICAL NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Atrophy; Cervical fusion; Lateral mass; Grades of paraspinal muscle atrophy	LUMBAR SPINE SURGERY; BACK MUSCLE; HISTOCHEMICAL ANALYSES; POSTOPERATIVE CHANGES; LOCAL DENERVATION; INJURY; RAMI	Objective: Paraspinal muscle atrophy (PMA) after posterior cervical fusion is a known complication that causes considerable morbidity. It has been shown in the lumbar spine that preservation of the posterior ramus of the spinal nerve is important in minimizing paraspinal muscle atrophy. During posterior cervical spine fusions, we modified the exposure of the dorsal cervical spine by exposing only the medial two-thirds of the lateral mass utilizing a low electrocautery setting. In a retrospective analysis, we compared the incidence of paraspinal muscle atrophy using this modified technique with historical cohorts who underwent posterior cervical fusion using the standard technique of exposure of the entire lateral mass. Materials and methods: All patients who underwent posterior cervical fusion and internal fixation between 1999 and 2007 were included. Patients operated from 1999 to 2003 who underwent the standard exposure of the lateral mass formed Group 1 (n = 31). Group 2 (n = 32) included patients whose lateral masses were exposed using the modified technique of limiting the exposure only to the medial two-thirds of the lateral mass with the cautery on a low setting. All patients were assessed for PMA at six months after surgery. Atrophy was graded as no atrophy, mild atrophy (minimal midline atrophy), moderate atrophy (muscle lost without palpable hardware) and severe atrophy (hardware palpable). Before initiating the study, no atrophy and mild atrophy were grouped together as a non-significant atrophy and moderate atrophy and severe atrophy were grouped together as significant atrophy. Results: We found a statistically lower incidence of paraspinal atrophy using this modified exposure of the lateral mass (p < 0.03). Conclusions: This modified technique of cervical spine exposure is associated with lower paraspinal muscle atrophy secondary to the preservation of the innervation of the paraspinal musculature.

Double-barrel fibular graft for metaphyseal areas reconstruction around the knee	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Bone defect; Double-barrel free vascular fibular graft; Knee	FREE VASCULARIZED FIBULA; POSTTRAUMATIC BONE DEFECTS; TRANSPORT; MANAGEMENT; FLAP; RESECTION; FEMUR	The metaphyses around the knee (distal femoral and proximal tibial) are junction areas subject to considerable stress. Double-barrel free vascular fibular graft (D-FVFG) provides good bone augmentation and restores the metaphyseal cone; the present study assessed its capacity to restore metaphyseal anatomy and axis and investigated its impact on the neighboring knee joint. Material and methods: Eight D-FVFGs performed for metaphyseal segmental bone defect were followed up for a mean 6.5 years (range, 3-14 years). There were seven femoral nonunions, five of which were septic, and one chondrosarcoma of the tibia. Osteosynthesis used an external fixator (EF) in six cases (four of which bridged the knee), a double plate on the tibia in one case, and intramedullary nailing of the femur in two cases, including one to replace an EF. Adjuvant bone graft was associated in six cases. A protective leg brace was maintained for a mean 16.0 +/- 4.0 months. Three arthrolyses were required after final union. Results: Union was achieved in all cases, after a mean 6.4 +/- 2.1 months. Sixty-four percent of defect volume was reconstructed. The immediate postoperative mechanical femorotibial angle was 180.3 +/- 6.0 degrees and 174.5 +/- 5.7 degrees at FU. Mean knee flexion was 96.9 +/- 36.0 degrees and extension -5.0 +/- 10.0 degrees. Three patients showed symptomatic arthritis at follow-up. Discussion: D-FVFG satisfactorily restored the anatomy of the metaphyseal area. EF knee bridging seemed to impair varus correction, on top of the systematic problem of stiffness. When possible, internal fixation in first intention or as EF replacement appears to be preferable. Arthritic deterioration of the knee is worsened by initial joint lesions and femorotibial varus.

We applied this algorithm to capture non-rigid deformation between digital images of histological slides and digital flat-bed scanned images of cryotomed sections of the larynx, and carried out validation experiments to measure the effectiveness of the algorithm. The implementation was carried out by extending the open-source Insight ToolKit software. In diagnostic imaging of cancer of the larynx, imaging modalities sensitive to both anatomy (such as MRI and CT) and function (PET) are valuable. However, these modalities differ in their capability to discriminate the margins of tumor. Gold standard tumor margins can be obtained from histological images from cryotomed sections of the larynx. Unfortunately, the process of freezing, fixation, cryotoming and staining the tissue to create histological images introduces non-rigid deformations and significant contrast changes. We demonstrate that the non-rigid registration algorithm we present is able to capture these deformations and the algorithm allows us to align histological images with scanned images of the larynx. Our non-rigid registration algorithm constructs a deformation field to warp one image onto another. The algorithm measures image similarity using a mutual information similarity criterion, and avoids spurious deformations due to noise by constraining the estimated deformation field with a linear elastic regularization term. The finite element method is used to represent the deformation field, and our implementation enables us to assign inhomogeneous material characteristics so that hard regions resist internal deformation whereas soft regions are more pliant. A gradient descent optimization strategy is used and this has enabled rapid and accurate convergence to the desired estimate of the deformation field. A further acceleration in speed without cost of accuracy is achieved by using an adaptive mesh refinement strategy. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Fractures around the hip: inducing life-like fractures as a basis for enhanced surgical training	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Surgical education; Realistic fracture simulation; Acetabulum fractures; Intertrochanteric fractures; Femoral neck fractures	FEMORAL-NECK FRACTURES; BONE-MINERAL DENSITY; OPEN REDUCTION; INTERNAL-FIXATION; CLASSIFICATION; CT; ACETABULUM; RISK	Introduction In this study we investigated if realistic fracture patterns around the hip can be produced on human cadaveric specimens with intact soft tissue envelope. Possible applications of such fractured specimens would be in surgical training. Materials and methods 7 cadaveric specimens (2 male, 5 female, 2 formalin-fixed, 5 fresh-frozen) were fractured. 2 specimens were fractured on both femurs, 5 only on one side, resulting in 9 fractures total. 5 fractures were set in our custom-made drop-test bench, 2 fractures by inducing axial force using a hammer, and the remaining 2 fractures by a direct dorsal approach and a chisel. AO/OTA and Pauwels classification were used to classify the fractures on the specimens by two independent trauma surgeons. Results In our drop-test bench, axial load with the femur adducted by 10 degrees resulted in an intertrochanteric fracture (AO type A1.3), adducted by 20 degrees resulted in a femoral neck fracture (Pauwels type III). Fracture induction using a hammer resulted in two intertrochanteric fractures (AO type A2.2 right, A3.3 left). The use of a chisel resulted in both cases in a femoral neck fracture. The acetabulum could be fractured multifragmentarily through use of a hemiprosthesis as a stamp. Conclusion A high energetic impulse induced by a custom-made drop-test bench can successfully simulate realistic proximal femur and acetabular fractures in cadaveric specimens with intact soft tissue. Furthermore, axial load using a hammer as well as using a chisel through a direct dorsal approach represent additional methods for fracture induction. These pre-fractured specimens can be utilized in surgical education to provide a realistic teaching experience for specialized trauma education courses.

Materials and Methods: A 3-dimensional finite element model of the mandible including the temporomandibular joint was created for a presurgical simulation and for BSSO with lingual split patterns I (T1; Hunsuck split) and II (T2; Obwegeser split). The mandible was advanced 3 mm (A3) and 8 mm (A8) and fixated with a conventional titanium plate. Ansys software was used to measure the linear distances of the interproximal segments and to analyze the transverse displacement distribution of proximal segments after applying the load of masticatory muscle force groups. Results: After surgical simulation, T1A3, T1A8, T2A3, and T2A8 showed increased transverse widths (mean, 2.99, 4.70, 2.36, and 4.42 mm, respectively). For transverse augmentation, there was a statistically significant difference between the 2 different mandibular advancement amounts in T1 and in T2 (P <= 000), but no significant differences was observed between T1 and T2 (P >= 058). The maximum transverse displacement distribution in the proximal segment was measured around the gonial area, and the early contact area was found near the border between the horizontal and sagittal osteotomy lines. Conclusion: Transverse displacements of proximal segments occur after BSSO advancement with T1 and T2 and transverse augmentation has statistically meaningful effects depending on the amount of advancement; however, no differences in transverse augmentation between T1 and T2 were identified. The fulcrum caused by the early contact between the proximal and distal segments could be an influential factor related to mandibular width.

Subsidence of collarless uncemented femoral stems in total hips replacements performed for trauma	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Total hip replacement; Fractured neck of femur; Femoral stem subsidence	DISPLACED INTRACAPSULAR FRACTURE; INTERNAL-FIXATION; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; NECK FRACTURES; SUBCAPITAL FRACTURES; TITANIUM-ALLOY; LONG-TERM; ARTHROPLASTY; COMPONENT; HEMIARTHROPLASTY	Introduction: Collarless, uncemented, femoral stems give excellent results in elective hip replacements but few studies look at outcomes in trauma patients. The presence of osteoporosis and subsequent widened femoral canal may compromise the mechanical stability of uncemented femoral stems resulting in early subsidence. The aim of this study was to assess whether early subsidence occurred when collarless uncemented stems were used to treat trauma patients. Materials and methods: Post-operative radiographs of 46 patients, mean age 71, who underwent an uncemented, collarless, total hip replacement for trauma, were reviewed. The difference in distance from the calcar to the prosthesis tip between the immediate post operative radiograph and the subsequent follow-up radiograph was calculated and adjusted for magnification. The same procedure was performed on 36 age-matched patients, who underwent elective hip replacements for osteoarthritis. Hospital notes were reviewed to assess for complications and DEXA scans reviewed for trauma patients where available. Results: The mean femoral stem subsidence was significantly greater in the fracture cohort than in elective patients (p = 0.001) with mean subsidence of 4.27 mm (range 0.02-22.05 mm) and 1.57 mm (range 0-5.5 mm), respectively. In the fracture cohort there were 4 revisions within 6 months of surgery, 1 for infection and 3 for femoral stem subsidence leading to dislocation. There were no revisions in the elective cohort. Discussion and conclusions: This study showed that collarless uncemented stems subsided significantly more when performed for fractures and had a high early revision rate. We recommend that uncemented collarless should not be used in trauma patients requiring total hip replacement. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Innovative osteosynthesis techniques were introduced and improved during the past 15 years. The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiologic development and the implementation of new treatment strategies in a nationwide register in Germany over a period of 15 years. Materials and methods Data of the German Federal Statistical Office from 2005 until 2019 were screened. Adults with a fracture of the distal fibula were included. Data were separated for gender, age and treatment strategy. Results During the past 15 years, there was a steady annual incidence of distal fibula fractures of 74 +/- 32 per 100,000 people without any significant changes (p = 0.436). 60.1% +/- 0.6% of all fractures occurred in females. The annual incidence for male was nearly constant over the different age groups, whereas for female, there was a clear increase in incidence above the age of 40. Whereas 66% of fractures in between 20 and 30 years of age occurred in male, approximately 70% of fractures above the age of 60 occurred in females. The relative quantity of locking plates increased from 2% in 2005 to 34% in 2019. In 2019, only 1.02% of the patients were operated with an intramedullary nail. Conclusions Operatively treated distal fibular fractures revealed an age dependent increase in incidence in postmenopausal women compared to younger females. Regarding the treatment strategy, there was an increase in application of locking plates. The data implicate a typical fragility fracture related age and gender distribution for distal fibula fractures.

Materials and methods: 3D virtual mandibular models were reconstructed from cone beam computed tomography images. A proposed mandibular resection of the mandibular body (40 mm anterior-posteriorly) was segmented. Internal structure of the resected bone was designed with topological optimization. Dental implants and implant-supported crowns were integrated into the design. A second 3D virtual model was created with the same size and location of the defect but was reconstructed with a fibular graft and implant-supported crowns. The biomechanical behaviors of the two models were compared by finite element method (FEM) under the same boundary constraints and three loading locations, namely, central incisors, lower left and right side first molar areas. Results: The FEM results showed the maximum stresses and displacements of the topology optimized model were much lower than those of the model with fibular bone graft. The highest stress of the optimized mandibular model was located on the lower edge of the posterior border of bone analog, and fixation screws. The maximum displacement occurred at the lower edge of the proximal mandibular stump or the lower edge of the distal mandibular body on the contralateral site. Under the same three loading locations, the maximum stress of the optimized model significantly decreased by 67.9%, 71.9% and 68.6% compared to the fibular graft model. Conclusions: The 3D printed bone analog with topological optimization is patient-specific and has advantages over the conventional fibular bone graft for surgical mandibular reconstruction. The optimized PEKK bone analog model creates more normal stress-strain trajectories than the fibular graft model and likely provides better functional and cosmetic outcomes.

Carbon and Nitrogen Cycling in a Shallow Productive Sub-Tropical Coastal Embayment (Western Moreton Bay, Australia): The Importance of Pelagic-Benthic Coupling	ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						sub-tropical; benthic metabolism; benthic microalgae; pelagic-benthic coupling; macrofauna; carbon cycling; ecosystem; Moreton Bay	EXTRACELLULAR ORGANIC-CARBON; NEW-SOUTH-WALES; PHYTOPLANKTON PRODUCTIVITY; ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM; EUPHOTIC SEDIMENTS; LIGHT AVAILABILITY; NUTRIENT FLUXES; ESTUARY; DENITRIFICATION; RIVER	Climatic variables, water quality, benthic fluxes, sediment properties, and infauna were measured six times over an annual cycle in a shallow sub-tropical embayment to characterize carbon and nutrient cycling, and elucidate the role of pelagic-benthic coupling. Organic carbon (OC) inputs to the bay are dominated by phytoplankton (mean 74%), followed by catchment inputs (15%), and benthic microalgae (BMA; 9%). The importance of catchment inputs was highly variable and dependent on antecedent rainfall, with significant storage of allochthonous OC in sediments following high flow events and remineralization of this material supporting productivity during the subsequent period. Outputs were dominated by benthic mineralization (mean 59% of total inputs), followed by pelagic mineralization (16%), burial (1%), and assimilation in macrofaunal biomass (2%). The net ecosystem metabolism (NEM = production minus respiration) varied between -4 and 33% (mean 9%) of total primary production, whereas the productivity/respiration (p/r) ranged between 0.96 and 1.5 (mean 1.13). Up to 100% of the NEM is potentially removed via the demersal detritivore pathway. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) inputs from the catchment contributed less than 1% of the total phytoplankton demand, implicating internal DIN recycling (pelagic 23% and benthic 19%) and potentially benthic dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) fluxes (27%) or N fixation (up to 47%) as important processes sustaining productivity. Although phytoplankton dominated OC inputs in this system, BMA exerted strong seasonal controls over benthic DIN fluxes, limiting pelagic productivity when mixing/photic depth approached 1.3. The results of this study suggest low DIN:TOC and net autotrophic NEM may be a significant feature of shallow sub-tropical systems where the mixing/photic depth is consistently less than 4.

After having evaluated the bone quality, TI01 and HT01 rods were implanted in the tibial diaphyses (two implants for each tibia) and epiphyses (1 implant for each tibia) of five young (YOUNG), five aged (AGED), and five aged and ovariectomized (OVX) sheep. The iliac crest trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) and number (Tb.N) in OVX sheep were respectively 33.5% and 28.5% lower than in YOUNG sheep (p < 0.005) and lower than in the AGED group (BV/TV, -17%; Tb.N, -13.5%; not significant); in the OVX group the trabecular separation was 77.9% higher than in YOUNG (p < 0.05) and 30.9% higher than in AGED animals. Lumbar vertebrae L5 bone mineral density was significantly lower in AGED (8.9%,p < 0.05) and OVX sheep (19.3%,p < 0.0005) when compared with YOUNG animals. Five samples of five sheep from each group were analyzed for each observation. At 3 months, in cortical bone both affinity index and pushout test results showed no significant differences between the two materials in each group of animals. In trabecular bone, the affinity index of HT01 was significantly higher than that of TI01 in each group of animals (YOUNG, 90.7%; AGED, 76.9%; OVX, 49.9%) with no significant differences between groups. In conclusion, the performance of TI01 and HT01 surfaces was high not only in YOUNG, but also in OVX animals and, therefore, they might be useful for aged and osteoporotic patients.

The goal of these in vitro experiments was to evaluate the performance of a selection of original and clone titanium abutments available for a widely used implant system with an internal conical connection. Materials and Methods: Six groups of original and clone abutments compatible with NobelActive implants were compared based on the following parameters: dimensional accuracy, gap formation, circumferential strain, abutment screw preload, micromotion, abutment settling, median fatigue limit (MFL), and bacterial leakage. Each parameter was analyzed separately and compared with the original (reference) abutment applying a variety of statistical tests (alpha = .05). Results: Overall, the results obtained in the different experiments showed considerable deviation from the reference abutment. Deviations in interface geometry of the abutments were inconsistent and reached up to 56.26%. Gap measurements performed on cross sections of implant-abutment assemblies were not sensitive enough for detecting consistent differences. Development of circumferential strain at the implant shoulder reached up to 1,389.30 mu m/m. Abutment screw preload ranged from 285.25 N to 397.70 N, while micromotion at the implant-abutment interface ranged from 61.68 mu m to 79.69 mu m. Abutment settling resulting from screw fixation was greater compared with settling caused by dynamic loading, reaching up to 0.09 mm. The MFL ranged from 246.00 N to 344.00 N. All implant-abutment combinations showed bacterial leakage after 6 days of incubation. Conclusion: While clone abutments may look similar to the original component, they display considerable differences and variations in their physico-mechanical characteristics detectable by advanced testing methods. How much these differences affect reliability and longevity of the restoration's clinical performance should be investigated in clinical studies.

Short-term hard and soft tissue changes after mandibular advancement surgery in Class II patients: a retrospective cephalometric study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS			English	Article							RIGID INTERNAL-FIXATION; LONG-TERM; PROFILE CHANGES; SPLIT OSTEOTOMY; STABILITY; PREDICTABILITY; GENIOPLASTY; PREDICTION; SETBACK	Aim:The aim of this study was to describe hard and soft tissue changes after mandibular advancement surgery and to investigate the possible differences between Class II facial patterns. Materials and methods:Lateral cephalograms of 109 patients who underwent combined orthodontic treatment and bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) were studied. Radiographs were taken within 6 weeks before surgery (T0) and at least 6 months postoperatively (T1). Patients were classified into 3 groups according to the preoperative mandibular plane angle. Hard- and soft-tissue changes were analysed with an x-y cranial base coordinate system. Measurements were evaluated statistically. Results:Soft and hard tissues of the chin moved forward and downward. The position of the upper lip remained unchanged, while the lower lip moved forward and upward and decreased in thickness. The soft tissue points of the chin follow their corresponding skeletal points almost completely, while the change of the lower lip was only 76 per cent of the movement of the underlying hard tissue. The increase of SNB was more evident in the low-angle group, as well as improvement of the facial convexity. Stomium superius moved more forward in the low-and medium-angle cases. Ratios of hard and soft tissue changes showed no differences for different facial patterns. Limitations:Limitations derived from the retrospective study design. Only short-term changes could be addressed. The distinction between surgical changes and changes due to skeletal relapse is difficult to assess. Also, the difficulty to reproduce a relaxed lip position during imaging may influence our results. Conclusion:Class II characteristics improved after mandibular advancement. Soft tissues of the chin follow their skeletal structures almost in a 1:1 relationship, while movement of the lower lip was less predictable. The facial pattern of Class II patients should be considered in treatment planning.	[Storms, A. S.; Miclotte, A.; de Llano-Perula, M.

Periprosthetic femoral fractures around the original cemented polished triple-tapered C-stem femoral implant: a consecutive series of 500 primary total hip arthroplasties with an average follow-up of 15 years	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Periprosthetic femoral fracture; Cemented; Polished; Taper-slip; Hip arthroplasty	RISK; COMPONENT; MINIMUM; CLASSIFICATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; REVISION; OUTCOMES; DESIGN; FEMUR	Introduction The true incidence of periprosthetic femoral fracture (PFF) around cemented polished taper-slip implants remains largely unknown. Registries usually only capture PFFs that result in revision, missing those managed non-operatively or treated by open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). This study reports the long-term rate of PFF with the original triple-tapered C-stem femoral implant. Materials and methods A prospective review of a consecutive series of 500 primary total hip arthroplasties (THAs) performed at a single centre between March 2000 and December 2005, with average follow-up of 15 years (12-19 years). Results There were 500 consecutive THAs in 455 patients. Seven PFFs (1.4%) occurred in seven patients at an average of 7.9 years (range 2-11.5) from the primary arthroplasty. Five PFFs were managed by ORIF, one Vancouver B3 fracture was revised for a loose implant and one patient was treated non-operatively. Average age at primary operation was 74 years (67-87) and BMI averaged 27.3 (22-31). There was no typical fracture pattern and no statistically significant associations with patient demographics (age, gender, BMI, diagnosis) or prosthetic details (size, offset, alignment, cement mantle, subsidence). Survivorship to the occurrence of PFF was 99% (97.3-99.6%) at 10 years and 97.8% (95.5-99.0%) at 15. Conclusion A PFF rate of 1.4% at an average follow-up of 15 years represents the true incidence of PFF with the use of the original triple-tapered C-Stem femoral implant, similar to that of published Exeter series (1.85%) but lower than the CPT (3.3%).

J	Wheeler, A; Czado, N; Gangitano, D; Turnbough, M; Hughes-Stamm, S				Wheeler, Amanda; Czado, Natalia; Gangitano, David; Turnbough, Meredith; Hughes-Stamm, Sheree			Comparison of DNA yield and STR success rates from different tissues in embalmed bodies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LEGAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Forensic DNA; STRs; Embalmed; FFPE; DNA damage; DNA degradation	IDENTIFICATION; CONTAMINATION; SAMPLES; BONE	Formalin fixation is commonly used to preserve tissue sections for pathological testing and embalming cadavers for medical dissection or burial. DNA extracted from formalin-fixed tissues may also provide an alternative source of genetic material for medical diagnosis and forensic casework, such as identifying unknown embalmed human remains. Formaldehyde causes DNA damage, chemical modifications, and degradation, thereby reducing the quantity and quality of DNA available for downstream genetic analyses. By comparing the DNA yield, level of DNA degradation, and short tandem repeat (STR) success of various tissue types, this study is the first of its kind to provide some guidance on which samples from embalmed bodies are likely to generate more complete STR profiles. Tissue samples were dissected from three male embalmed cadavers and included bone, cartilage, hair, muscle, internal organs, skin, teeth, and nail clippings. DNA was purified from all samples using the QIAampA (R) FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen), quantified using the QuantiFilerA (R) Trio DNA Quantification kit (Life Technologies), and genotyped using the GlobalFilerA (R) PCR Amplification Kit (Life Technologies). Results of this study showed variation in DNA quantity and STR success between different types of tissues and some variation between cadavers. Overall, bone marrow samples resulted in the highest DNA yields, the least DNA degradation, and greatest STR success. However, several muscle, hair, and nail samples generated higher STR success rates than traditionally harvested bone and tooth samples. A key advantage to preferentially using these tissue samples over bone (and marrow) and teeth is their comparative ease and speed of collection from the cadaver and processing during DNA extraction. Results also indicate that soft tissues affected by lividity (blood pooling) may experience greater exposure to formalin, resulting in more DNA damage and reduced downstream STR success than tissues under compression. Overall, we recommend harvesting from selected muscles (gastrocnemius, rectus femoris, flexor digitorum brevis, masseter, brachioradialis) or fingernails for human identification purposes.

Their classification based on standard radiographs is common practice although low inter-observer reliabilities and superiority of computer tomography (CT) scanning in evaluation of joint congruency have been reported. Materials and methods We retrospectively analyzed 96 displaced distal radius fractures scheduled for open reduction and internal fixation using standard radiographic assessment. The radiographs were classified with the Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen/Orthopaedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA), Fernandez and Frykman classifications by three observers and inter-rater reliabilities were calculated. Additional CT scanning was performed in all cases and the following parameters were assessed: radiocarpal joint involvement, fracture extent into the radial sigmoid notch, i.e. the distal radio-ulnar joint, comminution of the metaphysis, and concomitant ulnar styloid fracture. The CT scans were used as a reference standard to determine sensitivity and accuracy of standard radiographic assessment in evaluation of distal radius fractures. Results The inter-rater agreement for the AO classification was 35.4%, 68.8% for the Fernandez and 38.5% for the Frykman classification. Fracture extension into the radiocarpal joint was present in 81 cases (84.4%). Sigmoid notch involvement was found in 81 fractures (84.4%). Involvement of both joints was present in 72 cases (75%). The sensitivity of standard radiographs regarding radiocarpal joint involvement was 93.8%. Considering involvement of the distal radio-ulnar joint the false-negative rate using standard radiographs was 61.7% and the test's accuracy for sigmoid notch involvement was 45.8%. Conclusion This study demonstrates that involvement of the sigmoid notch is frequently missed in standard radiographs. The presented data support the frequent use of CT imaging to allow the holistic illustration of a fracture's complexion and to ensure optimal pre-operative planning.

Material/Methods: From January 2012 to March 2016, 59 patients, including 36 anterior column hemitransverse fractures, 18 two- column fractures, and five T-type complicated acetabular fractures, were treated with a single lateral rectus abdominis approach and fixed by plates and cannulated lag screws. Anterior column fractures were fixed with 3.5 mm reconstruction plates; posterior column fractures were fixed with 6.5 mm cannulated lag screws. The quality of surgical reduction (using the Matta criteria), functional outcome (using the modified Merle d'Aubigne and Postel scoring system), and postoperative complications were assessed with 24-month follow-up. Results: Fifty-nine patients (mean age, 45 years; range, 18-64 years) including 39 men and 20 women underwent surgery. Mean intraoperative blood loss was 514.6 ml (range, 150-830 ml) and mean operating time was 86.3 min (range, 42-145 min). Anatomical reduction was good in 40 cases (67.8%), fair in 15 cases (25.4%), and poor in four cases (6.8%). The modified Merle d'Aubigne score was excellent in 39 cases (66.1%), good in 14 cases (23.7%), fair in five cases (8.5%), and poor in one case (1.7%). At follow-up, there were five cases of peritoneal damage, eight cases of obturator nerve dysfunction, and four cases of postoperative traumatic arthritis. Conclusions: The single lateral rectus abdominis surgical approach for the treatment of complicated acetabular fractures was minimally invasive with good anatomical exposure and good outcomes.

Materials and Methods: Radiologic and clinical data from all patients who underwent an RMSA from 2007 through 2015 at the University Hospital of Geneva (Geneva, Switzerland) were retrospectively reviewed. The primary and secondary outcome variables were, respectively, FNP and other complications (unesthetic scars, infection, nonunion, malocclusion, salivary fistula, Frey syndrome, and loosening or breaking of plates and screws). Predictor variables included age, gender, mechanism of injury, delay from injury to surgery, surgeon's experience, location of fracture, side and pattern of fracture, concomitant facial fractures, and status of healing. Univariable logistic regression statistics were computed. Results: Forty-eight subcondylar fractures in 43 consecutive patients were treated using the RMSA. Six fracture sites (12.5%) developed a temporary FNP that completely resolved within 4 months. Fractures at the neck level and with the comminution pattern were significant risk factors of postoperative FNP (P = .04 and P < .001, respectively; odds ratio = 82). Eight patients (18.6%) developed a slight transient malocclusion that was completely corrected within 3 to 4 weeks using guiding elastics and 1 patient (2.3%) had a wound dehiscence that resolved with a visible but thin and linear scar. Conclusion: The present study showed that 1) the FNP rate after the RMSA to surgery for condylar fractures was similar to that reported after the transparotid variant; 2) the FNP was transient and completely resolved in all patients; 3) neck and comminuted condylar fractures were statistically associated with increased risk of developing a postoperative temporary FNP; and 4) the final outcome was favorable with no major complications in any of the patients.

The application of PRP combined with TCP in repairing avascular necrosis of the femoral head after femoral neck fracture in rabbit	EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						PRP; TCP; Femoral neck fracture; Avascular necrosis of the femoral head after femoral neck fracture; Repair	PLATELET-RICH PLASMA; COMPRESSION; BONE	OBJECTIVE: In view of the high occurrence of avascular necrosis of the femoral head (ANFH) after femoral neck fracture and the difficulties in thetreatment, our work aimed to explore the effects of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) combined with tri-calcium phosphate (TCP) on the repair of ANFH after femoral neck fracture and to provide reference for clinical treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into control group, TCP group, and PRP+TCP group. The rabbit ANFH model was established and femoral head tissues were collected. HE staining was used for histological observation. Image analysis and statistical analysis were used to calculate the New Bone Area fraction (NBA %). The levels of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-7, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in serum were detected by Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The new bone area of TCP group was significantly lower than that of PRP+TCP group (p<0.05). Compared with the control group, the levels of BMP-7, TGF-81 and bFGF were significantly increased in both TCP and PRP+TCPgroups (p<0.05), and the increase in PRP+TCP group was higher than that in TCP group. TCP and PRP+TCP can both significantly reduce the content of IL-6 and TNF-alpha (p<0.05); however, higher decrease was found in PRP+TCP group compared with the TCP group at 8 weeks after injection. CONCLUSIONS: PRP combined with TCP, which can promote new bone formation and inhibit inflammatory response, showed higher efficiency in repairing ANFH than internal fixation alone.

Development of HO after hip surgery is an important clinical issue as it can affect functional status. We aimed to determine whether there was association between severity of heterotopic ossification about the hip and the interval between the time of hip fracture and surgery.Materials and methodsOur retrospective study included 151 patients (age range 33-95years) treated for hip fractures by hemiarthroplasty. Medical records were reviewed for time interval to surgery, laterality, surgical approach, and patient age. Patients who had any post-operative complications were excluded. Radiographs were semiquantitatively assessed for the degree of heterotopic ossification based on Brooker Classification (5-point scale). Statistical analysis was performed utilizing Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, and Score tests, and also a proportional odds model (significance level set at 0.05).ResultsThirty eight patients had no heterotopic ossification, 43 had class 1, 55 had class 2, and 15 had class 3 or greater heterotopic ossification. The majority of patients (59.6%) had surgery within 2days of acute injury. Severe heterotopic ossification (HO 3+) was associated with the longer interval between the time of acute hip fracture and surgery (median 6days) vs. median 2days in all other groups (HO classes 0-2) (p=0.0015). The odds ratio and 95% CI for one level higher HO class was 1.296 (1.152, 1.459), which meant that the odds of having HO class one level higher increased by about 29.6% for every one-day increase in the days to surgery. No significant association was found for other variables.ConclusionClass 3 or greater HO was associated with longer time interval between time of acute hip fracture and surgery compared to all other groups (HO class 0-2).

Materials and methods: The clinical files of 12 patients who underwent RPOC for stabilization of malignant pathological fracture of the proximal femur were reviewed. There were 9 men and 3 women with a mean age of 56 years +/- 13 (SD) (range: 35-82 years). All patients had metastases of proximal femur and a high fracture risk (Mirels score >= 8) and were not eligible for surgical stabilization. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of a fracture after RPOC. Secondary endpoints were the procedure time, early complications of RPOC, pain reduction as assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) and duration of hospital stay. Results: No patients treated with RPOC had a fracture during a mean follow-up time of 382 days +/- 274 (SD) (range: 11-815 days). RPOC was performed under general (n = 10) or locoregional (n = 2) anesthesia. The average duration of the procedure was 95 min +/- 17 (SD) (range: 73-121 min). The technical success rate was 100%. All patients were able to walk on the day following RPOC. The average duration of hospital stay was 4 days +/- 3 (SD) (range: 2-10 days). No major complication occurred. One patient complained of hypoesthesia in the lateral thigh. For symptomatic patients (n = 7), VAS score decreased from 6.8 +/- 1.2 (SD) (range: 5-9) before treatment, to 2.3 +/- 1.1 (SD) (range: 1-4) one month later. Conclusion: Preventive RPOC for pathological fracture of the proximal femur is a reliable alternative for cancer patients who are not candidates for surgical stabilization. Studies involving more patients are needed to confirm our preliminary experience. (C) 2017 Editions francaises de radiologie. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The most advantageous and safest one is still a topic of discussion. The present analysis describes the combination of a retromandibular, transparotideal approach combined to a triangular-positioned double-miniplate osteosynthesis, with a special regard for the patients' long term outcomes. Material and methods: Clinical data of 102 patients with 124 condyle fractures treated with the mentioned surgical procedure were evaluated. Functional parameters such as the maximal interincisal distance, deviations/deflections, facial nerve function, occlusion as well as complications regarding the parotid gland, osteosynthesis, and esthetics were evaluated 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively. Results: The mean maximal interincisal distance ranged from 38 mm after 1 week to 45 mm after 6 months. Deviations/deflections were seen in 22.5% of the cases 1 week postoperatively and decreased to 2% at 6 months postoperatively. A temporary facial palsy was diagnosed in 3.9% during the first follow-up, whereas no impairment was recorded after 3 or 6 months. At the same time, no patient had occlusional disturbances or complications regarding the parotid gland or the osteosynthesis 6 months postoperatively. Conclusions: Direct fracture visualization and a stable three-dimensional fracture stabilization are the main advantages of the presented combination of a surgical approach and osteosynthesis technique. Additionally, the absence of long-term complications confirms the safety of the procedure. Therefore, it may be considered as a successful treatment option for mandibular condyle fractures.

Reconstruction survival of segmental megaendoprostheses: a retrospective analysis of 28 patients treated for intercalary bone defects after musculoskeletal tumor resections	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Intercalary endoprosthetic reconstruction; Segmental prosthesis; Aseptic stem loosening; Megaendoprostheses	LIMB-SALVAGE; ENDOPROSTHETIC RECONSTRUCTION; INTERNAL-FIXATION; REPLACEMENT; OUTCOMES; SURGERY; GRAFT	Introduction Intercalary endoprosthetic reconstructions have been reserved for patients with a limited life expectancy due to reports of high rates of early mechanical and reconstruction failure. Materials and methods In this study, we retrospectively analyzed 28 patients who underwent intercalary endoprosthetic reconstruction of the femur (n = 17) or tibia (n = 11) regarding reconstruction survival and causes of complications and reconstruction failure. Results A total of 56 stems were implanted in this collective, 67.9% of which were implanted using cementation. Eight different stem designs were implanted. The mean patient age at the time of operation was 42.3 years. The mean bone defect needing reconstruction measured 18.5 cm. Resection margins were clear in 96.4% of patients. Of twenty-six complications, five were not implant-associated. We observed infection in 10.7% (n = 3) and traumatic periprosthetic fracture in 3.6% (n = 1) of cases. The most frequent complication was aseptic stem loosening (ASL) (53.8%;n = 14) occurring in eight patients (28.6%). The metaphyseal and meta-diaphyseal regions of femur and tibia were most susceptible to ASL with a rate of 39.1% and 31.3% respectively. No ASLs occurred in epiphyseal or diaphyseal location. Overall reconstruction survival was 43.9% and 64.3% including patients who died of disease with their implant intact. Overall limb survival was 72.7%. Conclusions Proper planning of segmental reconstructions including stem design with regard to unique anatomical and biomechanical properties is mandatory to address the high rates of ASL in metaphyseal and metadiaphyseal stem sites. With continued efforts of improving stem design in these implantation sites and decreasing rates of mechanical failure, indications for segmental megaendoprostheses may also extend to younger patients with the localized disease for their advantages of early weight bearing and a lack of donor-site morbidity.

Identification and preliminary characterization of two cDNAs encoding unique carbonic anhydrases from the marine alga <i>Emiliania huxleyi</i>	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							DIATOM PHAEODACTYLUM-TRICORNUTUM; GENE-EXPRESSION; METHANOSARCINA-THERMOPHILA; CHLAMYDOMONAS-REINHARDTII; THALASSIOSIRA-WEISSFLOGII; HELICOSPORIDIUM SP; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; CHLOROPLAST; FIXATION; DIOXIDE	Marine coccolithophorid algae are thought to play a significant role in carbon cycling due to their ability to incorporate dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) into both calcite and photosynthetic products. Among cocco-lithophorids, Emiliania huxleyi is the most prolific, forming massive blooms that affect the global environment. In addition to its ecological importance, the elaborate calcite structures (coccoliths) are being investigated for the design of potential materials for science and biotechnological devices. To date, most of the research focus in this organism has involved the partitioning of DIC between calcification and photosynthesis, primarily using measurements of an external versus internal carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity under defined conditions. The actual genes, proteins, and pathways employed in these processes have not been identified and characterized (see the work of Quinn et al. in this issue [P. Quinn, R. M. Bowers, X. Zhang, T. M. Wahlund, M. A. Fanelli, D. Olszova, and B. A. Read, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 72:5512-5526, 2006]). In this study, the cloning and preliminary characterization of two genetically distinct carbonic anhydrase cDNAs are described. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that these two genes belonged to the gamma (gamma-EhCA2) and delta (delta-EhCA1) classes of carbonic anhydrases. The deduced amino acid sequence of delta-EhCA1 revealed that it encodes a protein of 702 amino acids (aa) (ca. 77.3 kDa), with a transmembrane N-terminal region of 373 aa and an in-frame C-terminal open reading frame of 329 aa that defines the CA region. The gamma-EhCA2 protein was 235 aa in length (ca. 24.9 kDa) and was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified as an active recombinant CA. The expression levels of each transcript from quantitative reverse transcription-PCR experiments under bicarbonate limitation and over a 24-h time course suggest that these isozymes perform different functions in E. huxleyi.

However, little is known about the extent to which the effects of staying home, social distancing, and quarantine measures have influenced the epidemiology of patients with maxillofacial trauma. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the incidence, demographic patterns, and characteristics of maxillofacial fractures in the largest hospital in southern Spain. Material and Methods: Data from patients who underwent surgery for maxillofacial fractures during the first year of the pandemic between 16 March 2020 and 14 March 2021 (pandemic group) were retrospectively compared with a control group during the equivalent period of the previous year (pre-pandemic group). The incidence was compared by weeks and by lockdown periods of the population. Demographic information, aetioloy, fracture characteristics, treatment performed, and days of preoperative stay were evaluated. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were calculated (p<0.05). Results: During the first year of the pandemic, there was a 35.2% reduction in maxillofacial fractures (n=59) compared to the pre-pandemic year (n=91, p=0.040). A significant drop was detected during the total home lockdown period of the population (p=0.028). In the pandemic group, there was a reduction in fractures due to interpersonal aggressions, an increase in panfacial fractures, a significant increase in other non-facial injuries associated with polytrauma (p= 0.037), a higher number of open reduction procedures with internal fixation, and a significantly longer mean preoperative stay (p= 0.016). Conclusions: The first pandemic year was associated with a decline in the frequency of maxillofacial trauma and a change in the pattern and characteristics of fractures. Inter-annual epidemiological knowledge of maxillofacial fractures may be useful for more efficient planning of resource allocation and surgical practice strategy during future coronavirus outbreaks and population lockdowns.

A Systematic Review of the Literature	JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE			English	Article						Ankle; Fracture; Ligament; Injury; Outcome; Biomechanics; Tibia; Talus; Posterior malleollus	TIBIOTALAR CONTACT AREA; ANKLE FRACTURES; PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION; OPERATIVE TREATMENT; TRIMALLEOLAR FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; TIBIAL MARGIN; TALAR SHIFT; JOINT; STABILITY	Introduction: Ankle fractures of-ten have involvement of the posterior malleolus. Treatment guidelines exist based on limited biomechanical evidence and still is considered controversial. The objective of this article is to review the biomechanical literature concerning changes in tibiotalar contract area, changes in contact pressures, changes in ankle stability and incongruency of the joint after a posterior malleolar ankle fracture, and to review the clinical literature concerning the outcome of operative and nonoperative treatment of these fractures. Ultimately, the goal is to try to formulate helpful recommendations for clinical practice. Material: The databases Pubmed/Medline, Cochrane Database of Systematic Re-views, Cochrane Clinical Trial Register, and Embase were searched from 1988 to November 2(X)7 to identify studies relating to changes in tibiotalar contact area, contact pressures, ankle stability, clinical outcome, and radiographic osteoarthritis after a posterior malleolar fracture. The search was restricted to articles written in the English, German, and Dutch language. Results: Eight biomechanical studies, involving 96 cadaveric ankles were included and 10 clinical studies, involving 447 fractured ankles, were included. Discussion: No consensus in the literature was found as to which fragment size of the posterior malleolus (=posterior tibial margin) should be internally fixed. This is partially because of the lack of standardization in examining functional outcomes, making it difficult to compare results. It is not the peak pressure or changes in tibiotalar contact area, but rather the changes in peak pressure distribution that play a large role in posttraumatic arthritis development It seems important to restore the medial and lateral constraints of the ankle because these, rather than the articular surfaces, provide the majority of ankle stability after an ankle fracture involving the posterior malleolar ankle fracture.

Effects of de- and rehydration on food-conducting cells in the moss <i>Polytrichum formosum</i>:: A cytological study	ANNALS OF BOTANY			English	Article						bryophytes; desiccation-tolerance; microtubules; oryzalin; plasmodesmata; Polytrichum formosum; rehydration; vascular tissue	DESICCATION-TOLERANCE; ENDOPLASMIC MICROTUBULES; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; TORTULA-RURALIS; ULTRASTRUCTURE; SELAGINELLA; BRYOPHYTES; TRANSPORT; SURVIVAL; POLARITY	Background and Aims Moss food-conducting cells (leptoids and specialized parenchyma cells) have a highly distinctive cytology characterized by a polarized cytoplasmic organization and longitudinal alignment of plastids, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and vesicles along endoplasmic microtubules. Previous studies on the desiccation biology of mosses have focused almost exclusively on photosynthetic tissues; the effects of desiccation on food-conducting cells are unknown. Reported here is a cytological study of the effects of de- and rehydration on food-conducting cells in the desiccation-tolerant moss Polytrichum formosum aimed at exploring whether the remarkable subcellular organization of these cells is related to the ability of mosses to survive desiccation. Methods Shoots of Polytrichum formosum were dehydrated under natural conditions and prepared for transmission and scanning electron microscopy using both standard and anhydrous chemical fixation protocols. Replicate samples were then fixed at intervals over a 24-h period following rehydration in either water or in a 10 mu M solution of the microtubule-disrupting drug oryzalin. Key Results Desiccation causes dramatic changes; the endoplasmic microtubules disappear; the nucleus, mitochondria and plastids become rounded and the longitudinal alignment of the organelles is lost, though cytoplasmic polarity is in part retained. Prominent stacks of endoplasmic reticulum, typical of the hydrated condition, are replaced with membranous tubules arranged at right angles to the main cellular axis. The internal cytoplasm becomes filled with small vacuoles and the plasmalemma forms labyrinthine tubular extensions outlining newly deposited ingrowths of cell wall material. Whereas plasmodesmata in meristematic cells at the shoot apex and in stem parenchyma cells appear to be unaffected by dehydration, those in leptoids become plugged with electron-opaque material. Starch deposits in parenchyma cells adjoining leptoids are depleted in desiccated plants. Rehydration sees complete reestablishment over a 12- to 24-h period of the cytology seen in the control plants. Oryzalin effectively prevents leptoid recovery. Conclusions The results point to a key role of the microtubular cytoskeleton in the rapid re-establishment of the elaborate cytoplasmic architecture of leptoids during rehydration. The reassembly of the endoplasmic microtubule system appears to dictate the time frame for the recovery process. The failure of leptoids to recover normal cytology in the presence of oryzalin further underlines the key role of the microtubules in the control of leptoid cytological organization.

Material and methods: The research was carried out in 42 patients of the Department for Maxillofacial Surgery, Hospital of the Ministry of Interior in Kielce (Poland), who were surgically treated in the years 2013-2015 after a unilateral condylar fracture. To be qualified for surgery patients fulfilled at least two of the following criteria: (1) presence of occlusal disorders, (2) presence of displacement of fragments, (3) height decrease of the mandibular ramus of over 4 mm, or (4) dislocation of the temporomandibular joint. The first of the above criteria (clinical criterion) was treated as the basic one, and the others were established based on radiological examinations. For all patients, a Delta plate fixed with four 2.0-mm screws was applied in order to achieve a stable osteosynthesis of the fracture. Clinical studies were carried out in all patients on the first day after the surgery, as well as after 1, 3, and 6 months. Results: The results presented in this study were based on an analysis of the most extensive research material in Poland (n = 42). All patients presented correct mandible mobility on all three planes, and the range of abduction after the conclusion of the treatment (i.e., 6 months after the surgery) amounted to average 47 mm (range 45-54 mm). In none of the cases analyzed in our study was there a breaking of the Delta plate. A rare complication observed in our own experience was the loosening and partial removal of one of the fastening screws from the bone and from the hole in the plate. This failure was observed in three patients (7%). Conclusions: The application of the Delta plate for the stable osteosynthesis of condylar fractures ensures fully satisfactory treatment results, both from the radiological and the clinical points of view. The use of Delta plates does not involve any significant complications. There is practically no risk of a breaking of the plate, and failures in form of the loosening of the retaining screws are very rare and do not cause any significant disturbances in the fracture healing process.

IM-NS was implanted into the right tibia (24-week investigation period; nails/screws diameter: 9 mm/3.5 mm, length: 130 mm/15-40 mm) of 10 adult sheep (LAE442, stainless steel, n = 5 each group). Clinical and radiographic examinations, in vivo computed tomography (CT), ex vivo micro-computed tomography (mu CT), mechanical and histological examinations and element analyses of alloying elements in inner organs were performed. The mechanical examinations (four-point bending) revealed a significant decrease of LAE442 implant stiffness, force at 0.2% offset yield point and maximum force. Periosteal (new bone formation) and endosteal (bone decline) located bone alterations occurred in both groups (LAE442 alloy more pronounced). Moderate gas formation was observed within the LAE442 alloy group. The CT-measured implant volume decreased slightly (not significant). Histologically a predominantly direct bone-to-implant interface existed within the LAE442 alloy group. Formation of a fibrous tissue capsule around the nail occurred in the steel group. Minor inflammatory infiltration was observed in the LAE442 alloy group. Significantly increased quantities of rare earth elements were detected in the LAE442 alloy group. mu CT examination showed the beginning of corrosion in dependence of the surrounding tissue. After 24 weeks the local biocompatibility of LAE442 can be considered as suitable for a degradable implant material. Statement of Significance An application oriented interlocked intramedullary nailing system in a comparative study (degradable magnesium-based LAE442 alloy vs. steel alloy) was examined in a sheep model for the first time. We focused in particular on the examination of implant degradation by means of(mu-)CT, mechanical properties (four-point bending), clinical compatibility, local bone reactions (X-ray and histology) and possible systemic toxicity (histology and element analyses of inner organs). A significant decrease of magnesium (LAE442 alloy) implant stiffness and maximum force occurred. Moderate not clinically relevant gas accumulation was determined. A predominantly direct bone-to-implant contact existed within the magnesium (LAE442 alloy) group compared to an indirect contact in the steel group. Rare earth element accumulation could be observed in inner organs but H&E staining was inconspicuous. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The evaluation of arteries originating from the abdominal aorta and aortic arch using CT-angiography plays a major role in the diagnostics and treatment of many conditions. The method is particularly meaningful in diagnostics before potential stentgraft implantation or angiosurgery, follow-up evaluation of patients after endovascular or angiosurgical procedures, management before hepatic transplantation and liver resection, patients with renal hypertension caused by renal artery stenosis, and patients with intermittent claudication or postprandial abdominal angina. Objectives. The goals of the study were to assess the prevalence of anatomical variants of arteries arising from the abdominal aorta and aortic arch and their clinical aspects and to evaluate the diagnostic potential and available techniques of modern CT-angiography in visualizing the selected arterial system. Material and Methods. CT-angiographies were performed in 240 consecutive patients enrolled between January 2004 and May 2007. The examinations were carried out using a 10-row CT unit with 3-mm slice thickness (primary reconstruction by means of thin slices with slice thickness of 1 mm). Contrast medium was injected with flow rate 4 ml/sec in a volume of 2 ml/kg patient body weight. Initially raw axial images of CT-angiographies were evaluated and then the following secondary two-dimensional and three-dimensional reconstructions were employed: coronal and sagittal reformations, multiplanar reformation, curved planar reformation, maximum intensity projection, and the volume rendering technique. Results. A common prevalence of anatomical variants of arteries arising from the abdominal aorta was demonstrated and their frequencies were estimated. The analyzed material revealed the following kinds of anomalies: renal arteries: early division of the renal artery and the presence of unilateral or bilateral additional renal arteries; hepatic arteries: different variants of hepatic arterial supply; celiac trunk: different anomalies of the origins from the abdominal aorta; aortic arch: rare presence of anatomical variants of large arteries arising from the aortic arch. Conclusions. CT-angiography enables rapid and accurate imaging of the abdominal arteries and the arteries commencing at the aortic arch, including detection of vascular anatomical variants, which is of great value before planned surgery and interventional radiological procedures as well as in the diagnostics of internal conditions. Various techniques of reconstruction are helpful in the visualization of arterial branches, which makes evaluation of the abdominal arterial system easier (Adv Clin Exp Med 2007, 16, 6, 751-760).

Implant with a feature of locking plate (LP) has been used widely for treating distal fractures in femur because of its favourable clinical outcome, but its potential in fixing proximal fractures in the subtrochancteric region has yet to be explored. Therefore, this comparative study was undertaken to demonstrate the merits of the LP implant in treating the subtrochancteric fracture by comparing its performance limits against those obtained with the more traditional implants; angle blade plate (ABP) and dynamic condylar screw plate (DCSP). Materials and Methods: Nine standard composite femurs were acquired, divided into three groups and fixed with LP (n=3), ABP (n=3) and DCSP (n=3). The fracture was modeled by a 20 mm gap created at the subtrochanteric region to experimentally study the biomechanical response of each implant under both static and dynamic axial loading paradigms. To confirm the experimental findings and to understand the critical interactions at the boundaries, the synthetic femur/implant systems were numerically analyzed by constructing hierarchical finite element models with nonlinear hyperelastic properties. The predictions from the analyses were then compared against the experimental measurements to demonstrate the validity of each numeric model, and to characterize the internal load distribution in the femur and load bearing properties of each implant. Results: The average measurements indicated that the constructs with ABP, DCPS and LP respectively had overall stiffness values of 70.9, 110.2 and 131.4 N/mm, and exhibited reversible deformations of 12.4, 4.9 and 4.1 mm when the applied dynamic load was 400 N and plastic deformations of 11.3, 2.4 and 1.4 mm when the load was 1000 N. The corresponding peak cyclic loads to failure were 1100, 1167 and 1600 N. The errors between the displacements measured experimentally or predicted by the nonlinear hierarchical hyperelastic model were less than 18%. In the implanted femur heads, the principal stresses were spatially heterogeneous for ABP and DCSP but more homogenous for LP, meaning LP had lower stress concentrations. Conclusion: When fixed with the LP implant, the synthetic femur model of the subtrochancteric fracture consistently exceeds in the key biomechanical measures of stability and durability. These capabilities suggest increased resistance to fatigue and failure, which are highly desirable features expected of functional implants and hence make the LP implant potentially a viable alternative to the conventional ABP or DCSP in the treatment of subtrochancteric femur fractures for the betterment of clinical outcome.

J	Pozharskii, DA				Pozharskii, D. A.			Contact problems for a two-layer elastic wedge	MECHANICS OF SOLIDS			English	Article								We obtain integral equations for plane contact problems for a two-layer wedge (composite) under three types of boundary conditions on one of its sides (absence of stresses, sliding, or rigid fixation). The composite consists of two wedges completely linked with each other, which have different opening angles and elasticity parameters. Using the symbols (Mellin transforms) of the kernels of integral equations for the two-layer wedge, one can derive the symbols of the kernels of integral equations for symmetric problems about a crack in a three-layer wedge or a three-layer strip and for contact problems for a two-layer strip (by passing to the limit in a special way). The complex zeros of the Mellin transform determine the asymptotics of the normal contact pressure at the corner point of the composite as the contact region approaches this point. It is important that this asymptotics is also preserved in three-dimensional contact problems as the die enters the edge of a two-layer wedge (outside the corner points of the die itself). Taking into account this asymptotics, we obtain solutions of the contact problems as the die enters the vertex of the composite. We show that by appropriately choosing the materials and the internal angle of the two-layer wedge one can avoid contact pressure oscillations at the vertex, which occur in the case of a homogeneous wedge and result in loss of contact. The contact pressure at the wedge vertex can be made zero for a composite, while for a homogeneous wedge with the same opening angle it increases unboundedly. We construct asymptotic solutions of the contact problems for a plane die located relatively close or to the vertex of a two-layer wedge or relatively far from the vertex. The asymptotic and other methods were earlier used to solve similar plane contact problems for a homogeneous wedge [1, 2]. In the case of sliding fixation of one of the sides of a plane homogeneous wedge, the closed solution of the contact problem is known for a die entering the corner point [3, p. 131]. Two-dimensional contact problems were studied for a truncated wedge [4] and for a wedge supported by a rod of equal resistance [5]. The out-of-plane shear vibrations were studied for wedge-shaped composites [6, 7]. The spatial contact problems were considered for a homogeneous wedge [8]. The plane contact problem was analyzed for a continuously inhomogeneous wedge one of whose sides was rigidly fixed (the shear modulus continuously depends on the angular coordinate and the Poisson coefficient is constant). For a two-layer composite, which is studied in the present paper, the kernel symbol has different asymptotic properties, which are used in asymptotic methods for solving the problem. A similar distinction of the symbol properties takes place in contact problems for a continuously inhomogeneous layer and a layered packet.

To improve the healing capability of HA, many studies have been performed to reveal its optimal structural characteristics for better healing outcomes. In spinal reconstruction surgery, non-interconnected porous HAs have already been applied as a bone graft extender in order to avoid autogenous bone harvesting. However, there have been few experimental studies regarding the effects of the structural characteristics of HA in posterolateral lumbar intertransverse process spine fusion (PLF). The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of HA porous characteristics on healing outcomes in a rabbit PLF model in order to elucidate appropriate structural characteristics of HA as a bone graft extender. Thirty-six adult female Japanese White rabbits underwent bilateral intertransverse process fusion at the level of L5-6 without internal fixation. We prepared three types of HA with different porosities: HA with 15% porosity (HA15%), HA with 50% porosity (HA50%), and HA with 85% porosity (HA85%), all of which were clinically available materials. The HA15% and HA50% had few interconnecting pores, whereas the HA85%, which was a recently developed material, had abundant interconnecting pores. All rabbits were randomly divided into the following four groups according to the grafted materials: (1) HA15% + autogenous bone, (2) HA50% + autogenous bone, (3) HA85% + autogenous bone, (4) pure autogenous bone graft. The animals were euthanized at 5 weeks after surgery, and post-mortem analyses including biomechanical testing, radiographical and histological evaluations were performed. There was no statistically significant difference in either fusion rate and/or bending stiffness among the three HA groups. However, in histological and radiological analyses, both bone ingrowth rate and direct bone bonding rate in the HA85% group were significantly higher than those in the HA15% and HA50% groups, despite the similar value of bone volume rate in fusion mass among the three HA groups. In the HA85% group, bone ingrowth was achieved throughout the implanted HAs via interconnecting pores and there was excellent unification between the HA granules and the newly mineralized bone. On the other hand, in the non-interconnected porous HA groups, only a little bone ingrowth could be seen at the peripheral pores of the implanted HA, and its surface was mostly covered with fibrous tissue or empty space. The current study demonstrated that the HA porous characteristics had an effect on the histological outcomes in a rabbit PLF model. We would like to conclude that the interconnected high porous structure seems to be promising for the environment of PLF in the point of producing fusion mass with higher cellular viability. This is because the HA85% is superior in terms of integration with the newly formed bone in fusion mass compared to the non-interconnected porous HAs. However, the porous modifications of HA have little influence on fusion rate and mechanical strength because primary stabilization of the fusion segment is mainly achieved by bridging bone between the adjacent transverse processes outside the implanted materials, rather than the degree of integration between the newly formed bone and the HA granules in PLF.

Although using noninvasive splints for 6-8 weeks is the gold standard for conservative treatment of closed soft-tissue mallet injuries, patient compliance is an important factor impacting on patient outcomes. In this study, we used a single Kirschner Wire (K-W) to fix the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint in extension in those patients failed to comply with routine splinting. Materials and methods In this prospective study, 190 patients with Doyle type 1 closed soft-tissue mallet finger deformity were included in four groups between 2011 and 2015. These groups were determined according to treatment modalities. Patients in the first group were treated with a finger splint (n = 109). Patients in the second group first received a finger splint and then K-W was applied due to lack of adequate compliance (n = 23). Patients in the third group were treated with K-W only (n = 47), and the fourth group did not accept surgical treatment nor conservative treatment (n = 11). After 20 weeks of follow up, we evaluated the results with functional measurements according to Crawford criteria and patient satisfaction. Additionally, the mid-term outcome was assessed with a follow-up at 2 years. Results At 20th week postoperatively, average DIP extension lag was 6 degrees (0-30) for the first group, 6.1 degrees (0-30) for the second group, 3.8 degrees (0-25) for the third group, and 17.3 degrees (7-30) for the fourth group. Total patient satisfaction was 85%, which was considered excellent or good. Swan neck deformity was observed in 11% of patients. Osteomyelitis and KW related complications were not observed. There were no statistically significant differences between short-term and mid-term results. Conclusion Internal fixation via K-W may be a suitable treatment option compared to splint therapy for management of closed soft-tissue mallet finger in noncompliant patients. Using this treatment approach, the success rate for patients could satisfactorily be improved.

Since the volume of autologous bone graft available is limited, allograft, demineralized bone matrix, and calcium phosphate ceramic-based bone graft substitutes have come up as potential autograft expanders. This study was conducted to analyze the use of beta tri-calcium phosphate (B-TCP)-based composite ceramic as autologous bone-graft expander in the management of postinfective segmental gap nonunion of long bones managed with two-stage Masquelet's technique. Materials and Methods: 42 consecutive patients with postinfective segmental long bone defects of 4u12 cm managed with Masquelet's-induced membrane technique, operated between February 2012 and June 2015, were included in this prospective case series. During the second stage bone-grafting procedure, iliac crest autograft alone or mixed with B-TCP granules (ratio not exceeding 1:1) was used along with appropriate internal-fixation. Bony union (defined clinicoradiologically as ability to painlessly bear weight on affected limb without support along with bridging of 3 cortices on X-rays) was evaluated. Results: Union was achieved in 80.9% patients (34/42) with index bone grafting. 100% union rate was achieved in patients where only autograft was used (15/15) and in nonsmoker femoral nonunion patients with the use of B-TCP (13/13). The use of B-TCP was associated with higher rate of nonunion in smokers (6/8, 75%) and in tibial nonunions (4/9, 55.5%). All, but one, of 8 patients with nonunion, united after the second-bone grafting procedure. Conclusion: B-TCP is an efficacious and safe autologous bone graft expander in Masquelet's two-stage management of post infective segmental gap nonunion of long bones. Patients should be counseled regarding increased risk of nonunion and need for repeat grafting with its use, especially if they are smokers or site of involvement is tibia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred sixty-one femoral neck fractures among patients aged 65 years treated with cemented hemiarthroplasty (HA) or uncemented total hip arthroplasty (THA) between January 2005 and October 2013 were evaluated. In the presence of articular pathologies as well as a fracture type Garden III or IV, the indication for joint replacement was given. Criteria for performing hemiarthroplasty were previously limited mobility. Freely and fully mobilised patients and patients with manifested osteoarthritis received a cementless THA. A comparison of the observed complications was made, differentiating between general and surgery-specific hip-related complications. Furthermore, the mortality rates were analysed in relation to the respective surgical treatment. RESULTS Seventy cemented HA and ninety-one uncemented THA were performed. There was a high complication rate of approximately 19% in both surgical intervention groups. The patients were more likely to develop general complications (HA 12.8%; THA 10.8%) even though cardiopulmonary complications occurred more frequently in the cemented HA group. Four patients died after cemented hemiarthroplasty due to thromboembolic events (5.7% mortality rate), whereas no deaths occurred after total hip replacement. Surgery-specific complications rates were 7.8% in THA and 5.7% in HA patients. CONCLUSIONS THA in eldery patients with femoral neck fractures is associated with a higher complication rate, mostly of general medical entity. After cemented HA, our study reveals a high mortality rate due to thromboembolic events. For patients with multimorbidity in particular, these findings therefore suggest that uncemented THA should be considered to prevent lethal complications.

Sales			Relevance of MRI for management of non-displaced lateral humeral condyle fractures in children	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						MRI; Humeral fracture; Lateral condyle fracture; Children	CLOSED REDUCTION; RADIOGRAPHS	Introduction: The treatment for non-displaced (<2 mm displacement) fractures of the lateral humeral condyle in children is controversial. Most studies recommend non-surgical treatment. However, plain radiographs are not sufficient to evaluate extension of the fracture line through the articular cartilage. This explains the high frequency of secondary displacements and non-unions, despite well-conducted conservative treatment. We hypothesized that MRI could be used to analyse whether the fracture is complete or incomplete. This could help to determine whether surgical or conservative treatment is indicated. Material and methods: This prospective study enrolled children being treated for a non-displaced (< 2 mm gap) fracture of the lateral humeral condyle. All patients were treated with a long-arm cast in the emergency room. An MRI was done later on without sedation. A specific protocol was used to reduce the duration of the examination. T2-weighted and proton density fat-saturated sequences were used. Results: Twenty-seven patients were enrolled: 16 boys and 11 girls with a mean age of 5 years (2-10). The MRI was performed an average of 7 days (1-23) after the fracture. The MRI could not be interpreted in two cases because the child had moved during the examination. In the other 25 patients, the fracture was incomplete in 17 patients and complete in 8 patients. Two children had secondary displacement diagnosed 7 and 11 days after the fracture event. These two patients underwent open reduction and internal fixation. There was no correlation between patient age and the fracture being complete or incomplete. There were no cases of non-union. Conclusion: MRI appears to be a reliable method for determining whether the fracture line is complete or incomplete. It can be performed without sedation, even in children as young as 2 years of age. Use of an injury-specific MRI protocol reduces the length of the examination, thereby improving its performance. We recommend that it be used to analyse non-displaced fractures of the lateral humeral condyle in children. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The management of these fractures pose a significant challenge. The compatibility of retrograde femoral intramedullary (IM) nails with femoral TKR components needs to be considered preoperatively when this complex pathology is addressed. The aim of this study was to update the literature and assess the compatibility of the most commonly used primary TKR prostheses and retrograde femoral IM nails using a Sawbone anatomical model. Methods and materials: Eight of the most commonly used primary TKR prostheses and four of the most commonly used retrograde femoral IM nails were identified. The femoral components of the TKRs were implanted onto left sided femoral Sawbones using the manufacturer's guides and cutting blocks and positioned appropriately. The retrograde IM nails were inserted using the conventional entry point and a nail was deemed compatible if this was possible through the femoral prosthesis. Details of whether a posterior entry point was required to allow insertion, whether the femoral nail was scratched by the femoral TKR prosthesis on insertion and whether excess force was required to insert the retrograde femoral IM nail were recorded. Results: The Biomet AGC Cruciate Retaining (CR) and Posterior Stabilised (PS) TKR were the only prostheses that were compatible with all the nails used. The other TKR prostheses were not compatible because of the force required to gain entry, scratching of the retrograde femoral IM nail or because a posterior entry point was required to gain entry through the intercondylar notch. Conclusion: The majority of standard sized retrograde femoral nails are technically feasible for insertion through most femoral TKR components but this study has found that they are not compatible due to excessive force required for insertion, damage to the nail during insertion or the risk of anterior cortex perforation. Further studies are required to update the compatibility table and cadaveric studies would confirm the findings and allow further mechanical testing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Haddad, SL; Dedhia, S; Ren, YP; Rotstein, J; Zhang, LQ				Haddad, Steven L.; Dedhia, Sunil; Ren, Yupeng; Rotstein, Jason; Zhang, Li-Qun			Deltoid Ligament Reconstruction: A Novel Technique with Biomechanical Analysis	FOOT & ANKLE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							CHRONIC LATERAL INSTABILITY; ANKLE JOINT; FOLLOW-UP; FRESH-FROZEN; ALLOGRAFT; GRAFT	Background: Deltoid ligament insufficiency has been shown to decrease tibiotalar contact area and increase peak pressures within the lateral ankle mortise. This detrimental effect may create an arthritic ankle joint if left unresolved. Reconstructive efforts thus far have been less than satisfactory. We describe a novel technique that reconstructs both main limbs of the deltoid ligament in anatomic orientation while providing secure graft fixation. Materials and Methods: Six pairs of fresh frozen cadaveric lower extremities were utilized. Matched right and left lower limbs (one pair) were allocated either to a deltoid reconstruction group or an intact deltoid group. The anterior tibial tendon was chosen as the graft for ligament reconstruction, and was harvested from the ipsilateral specimen. Tunnels were created in the distal tibia at the deltoid origin, and at the talus (deep) and calcaneus (superficial) deltoid insertions. Following measurement, the graft was cut to the appropriate size and endobuttons weaved into both tendon ends. The graft ends were passed through the talus and calcaneus respectively. The residual graft loop was then routed through the tibial tunnel and secured proximally with a cancellous screw post and spiked washer. Following specimen mounting, a multiaxis testing apparatus with three separate motors allowed three planes (dorsiflexion/plantarflexion; inversion/eversion; and internal/external rotation) of motion. Angular rotations and linear translations of the tibia in the X-Y-Z directions were measured for a given torque in external/internal rotation, dorsiflexion/plantarflexion, or eversion/inversion, under a constant velocity of 2 degrees per second. Testing consisted of a 2 Nm preload for 20 cycles in internal rotation/external rotation and inversion/eversion prior to data collection of 10 cycles at this level of torque. Similarly, a preload of 1 Nm for 20 cycles was used in dorsiflexion/plantarflexion prior to data collection of 10 cycles at this torque level. Data were collected in the control specimens (the matched contralateral extremity) with the deltoid ligament intact, and following complete sectioning of the ligament complex (both bundles). Results: Angular displacement at a 2 Nm level torque was significantly greater in the sectioned group compared to the deltoid reconstruction group in external rotation and eversion (p = 0.006 and p = 0.017 respectively). There was no statistical difference in angular displacement between the deltoid intact and reconstructed group in external rotation and eversion when tested at 2 Nm of torque (p = 0.865 and p = 0.470, respectively). The stiffness of the reconstruction was 136.4 +/- 40.2% compared to the intact ligament. Stiffness data were statistically insignificant in both plantar flexion and dorsiflexion between the reconstructed and sectioned groups (p = 0.050 and p = 0.126). Conclusion: The described reconstruction technique under low torque was able to restore eversion and external rotation stability to the talus, which was statistically similar to the intact deltoid ligament. This novel technique developed its strength not only from the anatomic orientation of the reconstructed ligament, but the strength of the components chosen to fix the tendon graft to the bone. Clinical Relevance: This utilitarian reconstruction may be incorporated into total ankle arthroplasty, triple arthrodesis, and sports injuries to re-establish lost medial stability.

Materials and methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted over 5 years on patients who were treated surgically for mandibular condylar fractures using the retomandibular transparotid approach (RMTA). The primary result was FNI occurrence (yes/no). The predictor variables were demographic, fracture location, and pattern (dislocation, present or not), as well as surgeon experience. Post-treatment functional facial nerve changes were initially assessed in the operating room as the patient regained consciousness and documented thereafter within, the 1st and 3rd weeks, and 3rd and 6th months. Appropriate statistics were computed and, SPSS version 16 was used to analyze the data. chi(2) test and Fisher exact test were used to assess significance (P <= 0.05). Results: Eighty-nine patients with 102 condylar fractures (63 subcondylar and 26 condylar neck), with a mean age of 28.5 +/- 7.5 years and 91% men were evaluated. There were 15 subjects (16.8%) with FNI and among them 6 subjects had persistent facial weakness for 6-8 weeks that completely resolved within 3 months, with no permanent facial nerve paralysis. The marginal mandibular (n = 7), buccal (n = 6), and zygomatic (n = 2) were the facial nerve branches involved. Risk factors for FNI were operator' inexperience, fracture-dislocation, and condylar neck fracture to the site and location of the fracture. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the location of the fracture at neck level (0.030*), fracture dislocation (<0.001*), and operator's inexperience (0.003*) were significant risk factors for postoperative facial nerve injury (P <= 0.05). Conclusions: If conducted properly, the RMTA is a safe method for treating condylar fractures with rare major complications; however, fracture dislocation, fractured condylar neck, and operator' in-experience were significantly associated with increased risk of developing transient postoperative FNI.

For clinical research, it is important to determine the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID). The objective of this study was to determine the MCID of the OMAS at several moments in the follow-up, in a cohort of patients that underwent open reduction and internal fixation of unstable ankle fractures with syndesmotic injury. Materials and methods Data for this descriptive study were extracted from a prospective randomized controlled trial, the RODEO trial. The Dutch version of the OMAS was completed at 3, 6 and 12-month follow-up and estimated at baseline. The used anchor-based methods were: mean change and ROC curve. The distribution-based methods were: 0.5SD and minimal detectable change (MDC). Results This cohort included 148 patients. The mean OMAS score in the group with minimal improvement between 3 and 6 months was 15.0 (SD 17.5, 95%CI 9.4-20.6) and between 6 and 12 months 9.5 (SD 17.1, 95% CI 3.1-15.9). The ROC curve between 3 and 6 months resulted in a MCID of 12.5 (AUC 0.72) and between 6 and 12 months, the MCID was 7.5 (AUC 0.78). Using 0.5 SD, the MCID was 10.52 (SD 21.04) at 3 months, 11.37 (SD 22.73) at 6 months and 10.47 (SD 20.94) at 12 months. The MDC was 4.72 at 3 months, 5.20 at 6 months and 4.71 at 12 months. Conclusions The calculated MCID in patients following surgery for unstable ankle fractures ranges from 10.5 to 15.0 at 3-6-month follow-up and from 7.5 to 11.4 at 6-12-month follow-up, depending on moment and method.

Ability of a Risk Prediction Tool to Stratify Quality and Cost for Older Patients With Operative Distal Radius Fractures	GERIATRIC ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY & REHABILITATION			English	Article						distal radius fractures; risk stratification; triage; geriatric; hospital quality measures	INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; TRAUMA; MORTALITY; OUTCOMES; MANAGEMENT; AGE; MEDICARE; FRAILTY	Introduction: Distal radius fractures are the second most common fracture in the elderly population. The incidence of these fractures has increased over time, and is projected to continue to do so. The aim of this study is to utilize a validated trauma risk prediction tool to stratify middle-aged and geriatric patients with operative distal radius fractures as well as compare hospital quality metrics and inpatient hospitalization costs among the risk groups. Materials and Methods: Patients were prospectively enrolled in an orthopedic trauma registry. The Score for Trauma Triage in Geriatric and Middle Aged (STTGMA) was calculated using patient demographics, injury severity, and functional status. Patients were then stratified into minimal-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk cohorts based on their scores. Length of stay, need for escalation of care, complications, mortality, discharge location, 1-year patient reported outcomes, and index admission costs were evaluated. Results: Ninety-two patients met inclusion criteria. Sixty-three (68.5%) patients were managed with outpatient surgery. The mean inpatient length of stay for the high-risk cohort was 2.9x and 2.2x higher than the minimal and moderate-risk cohorts, respectively (2.0 + 2.9 days vs. 0.7 + 0.9 and 0.9 + 1.1 days, P = .019). There were no complications or mortality in any of the risk groups. No patients required intensive care and all patients were discharged home. There was no difference in readmission rates, inpatient cost, or 1-year patient reported outcomes among the risk cohorts. Discussion/Conclusions: The Score for Trauma Triage in Geriatric and Middle-Aged is able to risk-stratify patients that undergo operative intervention of distal radius fractures. Middle aged and elderly patients with isolated closed distal radius fractures can be safely managed on an outpatient basis regardless of risk. Standardized pathways can be created in the management of these injuries, thereby optimizing value-based care.

While these techniques are still currently utilized, new methods have been developed. This study aimed to report the radiologic and clinical outcomes of depressed calcaneal fracture treatment with the "push-out molding" technique and to propose its clinical utility. Materials and methods: From March 2009 to October 2020, a retrospective study was conducted with 52 patients, who received the "push-out molding" technique to treat depressed intra-articular calcaneal fractures (Sanders type II, III, IV). Exclusion criteria were as follows: pa-tients with bilateral calcaneal fractures, open fractures, and a follow-up period <12 months. Radiologic parameters were assessed at following periods: preoperative, postoperative, 3-month follow-up, and last follow-up. Limitation of range of motion (ROM), subjective satisfaction, and complications were assessed at the last follow-up period. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to analyze values at preoperative, postoperative, 3-month, and last follow-up periods. Results: Significant differences in the talo-calcaneal angle (p < 0.001), Bo center dot hler's angle (p=<0.001), Gissane's angle (p = 0.023), distance from the lower cortical border of calcaneus to the anterior (p=<0.001) and posterior (p=<0.001) points of posterior articular surface, calcaneal length (p = 0.019), and talo-calcaneal height (p=<0.001). Postoperatively, the posterior articular surface was well maintained, while 21.2% retained a ROM limitation by 20 degrees or higher. Subjective satisfaction was as follows: excellent (42.3%), good (48.1%), fair (9.6%), and poor (0%). Conclusion: The "push-out molding" is a simple technique with the advantage of not requiring much force to treat depressed calcaneal fractures. It can be used as a beneficial surgical technique with minimal damage to the soft tissue, owing to the reduction from the depressed interior part and less severe ROM limitation.

METHODS: A total of 431 patients with single-segment lumbar degenerative disease diagnosed from January 2013 to December 2016 were considered for the present prospective, nonrandomized, and controlled study; 52 patient met the exclusion criteria and were excluded. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to their cage choice: Biocage (n = 206) and polyether ether ketone (PEEK) cage (n = 173). The patients were followed up for 24-48 months (average, 32). The operative time, blood loss, hospitalization duration, mean intervertebral fusion segment height, height of intervertebral foramen, fusion time, fusion rate, internal fixation failure rate, visual analog scale score, and Oswestry disability index were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: All the patients underwent surgery successfully. No significant differences were found in gender, age, clinical diagnosis, lesion segment, operative time, blood loss, visual analog scale score, or Oswestry disability index between the 2 groups. No significant differences were found in the fusion rate; however, the Biocage group had a greater fusion rate and shorter fusion time than the PEEK group. During follow-up, the mean intervertebral height recovered significantly in the Biocage group compared with the PPEK group (P < 0.05). The height of the intervertebral foramen was significantly different between the 2 groups, and recovery was better in the Biocage group (P < 0.05). The Cobb angle of fusion segment in both groups improved significantly postoperatively compared with preoperatively (P < 0.05). The improvement in Cobb angle was significantly different between the 2 groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The Biocage has excellent clinical efficacy in the treatment of lumbar degenerative disease. Although the Biocage achieved good therapeutic effects, it did not show obvious advantages compared with the PEEK cage. Therefore, the Biocage can only be used as a choice of bone graft materials for lumbar fusion surgery and should not completely replace the PEEK cage.

Materials and Methods: In 102 patients with 124 calcaneal fractures, spiral CT was performed, in 82 cases as SSCT with a slice thickness (SD) of 3 mm, a table speed (TS) of 3 - 4 mm/rot and an increment of 1.5 mm. In 42 cases, patients were scanned using MSCT (SD of 1.25 mm, increment 0.8 mm). For these examinations, 2 different scan protocols were used, with a TS of 3.75 mm/rot in one group (n = 21) and a TS of 7.5 mm/rot in the other group (n = 21). The image quality of axial sections and reconstructed images was assessed on a scale from I to 5 (1 = very good; 5 = insufficient). The fractures were evaluated using a classification system according to Stuermer, which assigns three main groups (A/B/C) and three subtypes (1/2/3). Results: MSCT had substantial advantages over SSCT with respect to scan time and image quality, especially for multiplanar reformatting (median 1.5 versus 4.0). TS showed no significant influence on the image quality. The standardized evaluation of the images enabled a classification of fractures within 5 minutes. All fractures could be assigned to the different types and subtypes. This classification system takes into account the severity of the fracture and the therapeutic approach. The most common type (90 of 124 fractures) were "joint depression" fractures (type C), which were treated by surgery in 92%. Type A fractures were treated conservatively in 72%. Conclusion: Spiral CT, especially MSCT, allows rapid diagnosis and precise classification of calcaneal fractures, achieved with high quality multiplanar reformatting. The presented classification in different fracture types and subtypes allows an adequate planning of therapy.

A New and Quantitative Evaluation Method Using Current Perception Threshold Testing	JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							SEMMES-WEINSTEIN MONOFILAMENTS; INFRAORBITAL NERVE; SENSORY FUNCTION; BONE-FRACTURES; INJURY; SENSIBILITY; REPAIR; REEDUCATION; RELIABILITY; RECOVERY	Purpose: The aims of the present study were to analyze the effectiveness of current perception threshold (CPT) testing to determine patients' minor paresthesia of the infraorbital region after open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for unilateral zygomaticomaxillary bone fracture (UZF) and to clarify which nerve fiber was related to the paresthesia. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who had undergone ORIF after UZF. We also performed neurosensory testing for healthy volunteers who served as the control group. The predictor variables were the period of measurement of Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (S-W) testing and CPT testing (preoperatively and 1 and 5 years postoperatively), measurement side, and disease status (UZF or control). The outcome variables were paresthesia status of the infraorbital nerve region and the results of S-W and CPT testing in both UZF and control groups. The differences in the S-W and CPT values between the affected and unaffected sides in the UZF group and between the UZF and control groups were analyzed by t test (P < .05 was considered significant). Results: The present study included 10 patients (6 males and 4 females), with an average age of 25.0 +/- 12.7 years, and 21 controls (10 males and 11 females), with an average age of 24.3 +/- 1.7 years. In the control group, the CPT and S-W test results did not show any significant differences between the left and right sides. All 10 patients had paresthesia at 1 and 5 years postoperatively. At 5 years postoperatively, the S-W values in all patients showed normalization. From the results of CPT testing, only the A-beta fiber function showed significant improvement at 5 years postoperatively. Conclusion: The CPT test was an effective sensory test for determining minor paresthesia that could not be detected using S-W testing. Paresthesia of the infraorbital nerve region was caused by the damaged A-delta and C fibers.

Insulin Dependence Is Associated With Increased Risk of Complications After Upper Extremity Surgery in Diabetic Patients	JOURNAL OF HAND SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME			English	Article						Hand; insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; noneinsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; surgical site infections; upper extremity	SURGICAL-SITE INFECTION; QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM; REDUCTION INTERNAL-FIXATION; DISTAL RADIUS FRACTURES; TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY; ORTHOPEDIC-SURGERY; TRIGGER FINGER; HAND SURGERY; ACS-NSQIP; OUTCOMES	Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with the development of carpal tunnel syndrome, Dupuytren disease, trigger digits, and limited joint mobility. Despite descriptions of poorer response to nonsurgical treatment, previous studies have not shown increased complication rates in diabetic patients after hand surgery. Few studies, however, differentiate between insulin-dependent (IDDM) and noneinsulin-dependent (NIDDM) diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of insulin dependence on the postoperative risk profile of diabetic patients after hand surgery using a national database. Materials and methods The data were obtained through the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database. Patients undergoing surgery from the distal humerus to the hand, between 2005 and 2015, were identified using 297 distinct Current Procedural Terminology codes. Thirty-day postoperative complications were collected and categorized into medical complications, surgical site complications, and readmission. Surgical complications, medical complications, and readmissions were compared between patients with NIDDM or IDDM to those without DM using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for baseline patient and operative characteristics. Results The study cohort included 52,727 patients. Patients with IDDM had a 5.7% overall complication rate compared with 2.3% and 1.5% in NIDDM and nondiabetic patients, respectively. After controlling for differences in patient and surgical characteristics, patients with IDDM had a statistically significant increased rate of any complication, surgical site complications, superficial surgical site infections, and readmission. There was no significant difference in complication rates between patients with NIDDM and nondiabetic patients. Conclusions Our data demonstrate a greater risk of complications following hand and upper extremity surgery for patients with IDDM, specifically surgical site infections. The NIDDM patients did not have an increased rate of complications relative to nondiabetic patients. These findings are important for patient risk stratification and may guide further investigation to decrease complication rates in IDDM patients after upper extremity surgery.

A Modified Technique for Occipitocervical Fusion Using Compressed Iliac Crest Allograft Results in a High Rate of Fusion in the Pediatric Population	WORLD NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Allograft; Atlantooccipital dislocation; Atlantooccipital dissociation; Craniocervical instability; Occipitocervical fusion; OC fusion; Pediatric; Pseudarthrosis	POSTERIOR CERVICAL FUSIONS; RIGID INTERNAL-FIXATION; DONOR-SITE MORBIDITY; CLINICAL ARTICLE; CRANIOVERTEBRAL JUNCTION; SPINE INSTRUMENTATION; SURGICAL-TECHNIQUE; BONE-GRAFTS; CHILDREN; CONSTRUCT	BACKGROUND: In children, high rates of occipitocer-vical (OC) fusion have been demonstrated with the use of rigid instrumentation in combination with harvested autograft, with or without bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). Historically, the use of allograft materials demonstrated inferior OC fusion outcomes compared with autograft. However, autograft harvest harbors an increased risk of patient morbidity, and the use of BMP is costly and controversial in children. Thus, there remains a need for safer, less costly, yet efficacious techniques for OC fusion in the pediatric population. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients younger than 21 years of age who underwent OC fusion with structural allograft placement at our institution from 2010 to 2015. Data collected included age, sex, follow up duration, fusion outcomes, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: A total of 19 patients (8 female and 11 male) underwent OC fusion with our surgical technique. Mean age was 8.5 +/- 4.3 years. Radiographic follow up data were available for 18 of 19 patients. One patient was lost to clinical follow up but had radiographic confirmation of fusion. Thus, 18 of 18 (100%) of patients with radiographic follow-up achieved successful arthrodesis as determined by computed tomography. Median duration to documented fusion was 4.5 months. Clinical follow-up was available for 17 of 19 patients and was on average 18.8 +/- 13.5 months. One patient required reoperation for graft fracture 8 months after radiographic confirmation of successful fusion. There were no vertebral artery injuries or other postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a modified technique for OC fusion in children with unique structural allograft shaping and affixation, leading to excellent fusion outcomes at follow up. This technique obviates the need for autograft harvest or BMP, and may decrease postoperative morbidity.

In this study, we evaluate function 1-7 years after implantation and also function after removal of five prostheses. Material and methods: Eighteen patients with radial head fracture and associated elbow instability were evaluated 3.7 years (1-7) after implantation of a radial head prosthesis. Pain at rest and during activity was measured with a visual analogue scale (VAS). Test of stability and neurological examination was done manually as well as measurement of the range of motion, using a goniometer. Activity of daily living (ADL) was estimated using five questions where the answers were graded between 1 and 3. The patients were asked to grade their general satisfaction according to the following scale; very satisfied, satisfied, not satisfied, disappointed. Plain X-rays were taken and 14 patients agreed to have their elbow strength evaluated using the validated BTE work simulator. Results: Five prostheses had been extracted due to poor range of motion. All these patients improved after extraction. All elbows were stable. No patient with extracted prosthesis had VAS score > 2. The mean extension defect for this group was 15 degrees (5-25) compared to the mean extension defect for the 13 patients with the prosthesis still in place 15 degrees (0-40). The highest VAS score for the patients with prosthesis was five but the mean as low as 0.8. In the whole group, 13 patients were pain free. ADL function was good in general. The X-rays of the prostheses, still in place, showed radiolucent lines in 7 of the 13 patients. In the whole group, there was a significant decrease in supination, flexion and extension strength (P < 0.01, P < 0.01, P < 0.05). Discussion: Radial head prosthesis works as a spacer after fracture of the radial head and associated instability. If range of motion is much restricted post-operatively, the prosthesis can be removed with improved function as result.

The present study aimed to identify the clinical effect of the application of geneX (R) ds in elderly patients with intertrochanteric fracture treated using proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA). Materials and methods: From March 2014 to October 2017, 233 patients with intertrochanteric fracture (65 men and 168 women) were enrolled in this study. All patients received surgical treatment using PFNA. Patients were classified into two groups: those in whom geneX (R) ds which is synthetic osteo-conductive bone graft substitute with the unique property of Zeta Potential Control (ZPC (R)), was use, and those in whom it was not. We compared the preoperative details and surgical outcomes, including radiologic outcome (postoperative reduction, tip apex distance, sliding distance of the helical blade, union, and union time) and clinical outcomes (Harris Hip Score and the walking ability at the last follow-up) between the groups. Results: In patients with unstable fracture who achieved anatomical or extramedullary type of reduction, the average sliding distance at 1, 3, and 12 months was 4.9 mm, 7.5 mmm and 8.1 mm in the geneX (R) ds group and 7.5 mm, 10.8 mm, and 12.1 mm in the no geneX (R) ds group, respectively. There were significant differences in the sliding distance at 1, 3, and 12 months between these two groups. Conclusion: The use of this synthetic osteo-conductive bone graft substitute with zeta potential control may have positive effect on the controlled sliding of the helical blade and the healing of intertrochanteric fracture.

This is primarily because with current imaging modalities it is difficult to accurately and conveniently determine the stability of the fractures by detecting the integrity of the cartilage hinge. Nevertheless, transverse ultrasonography has not been intensively reported in previous studies. Hypothesis: Transverse ultrasonography can determine the integrity of the cartilage hinge in minimally displaced lateral condyle fractures. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 39 pediatric patients with minimally displaced fractures of the lateral humeral condyle who underwent transverse ultrasonography between 2014 and 2017. Conservative treatment was given to pediatric patients with intact cartilage hinges that had been confirmed by transverse ultrasound images. Surgical treatment was recommended for pediatric patients with disrupted cartilage hinges. Data regarding healing of the lateral humeral condyle fractures were recorded and analyzed. Results: According to transverse ultrasonography, there were 14 children with intact cartilage hinges and 25 children with disrupted cartilage hinges. Fourteen children with intact cartilage hinges of the fracture were treated conservatively, and none of them showed secondary displacement. There were 16 children in whom there was surgical intervention, and 9 other children decided to have conservative treatment among the 25 children with disruption of the cartilage hinge. Five of these 9 children who underwent conservative treatment were found to have further displacement during an average of 12.6 days after the fracture event, and no other patient was found to have further displacement. Conclusion: Transverse ultrasonography can simply and accurately determine the stability of minimally displaced lateral condyle fractures without sedation, ionizing radiation or invasive techniques. We recommend routine use of transverse ultrasonography to detect stability of the fractures, which can effectively avoid inadequate treatment and unnecessary surgery in pediatric patients with minimally displaced fractures of the lateral humeral condyle.

This plate was used for ankle arthrodesis of a 68-year-old female with a right ankle deformity. Both the plate and screws were considered in this investigation. Optical and scanning electron microscopes (SEM) were used to document fracture surface characteristics, such as extensive scratching, plastic deformation, rubbed surfaces, discoloration, and pitting, along with cleavage, secondary cracking, deposits of debris, striations, and dimples. Indications of these features show that the plate failed by corrosion fatigue, however, overloading separated the screw(s) in two parts. Radiographic evidence shows that the screws failed ahead of the plate from the proximal end. Three-dimensional models of the plate and the screws: cortical, locking, and cannulated, were constructed using Solidworks and imported in ANSYS Workbench 16.2 to simulate the loading conditions and regions of stress development. Statistical analysis was conducted to understand the impact of different factors on the maximum von Mises stresses of the locking compression plate. These factors were the load, screw design pattern, coefficient of friction between the plate and screws, and cortical screw displacement. In summary, the finite element simulation of the plate validates the fractographic examination results. The following observations were made: (a) as the angle between the screws and the plates increased, the von Mises stresses increased in the cortical screws; and (b) the stress in the locking screws was lower than that of the cortical screws, which may be due to locking the screws with fixed angles onto the plate. Finally, fractographic examination of the cortical and locking screws supports the mechanism of corrosion-fatigue fracture from crack initiation sites, pits, due to the presence of inclusion bodies for this material (ASTM standards F138-03 and F139-03) documented for the plate in Paper I.

See vol. 104, pg. 547, 2018)	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article; Retracted Publication						Ankle-hindfoot; Calcaneal fractures; Biomechanics; Experimental; Finite element	INTRAARTICULAR FRACTURES; CONTACT CHARACTERISTICS; NONOPERATIVE TREATMENT; INTERNAL-FIXATION; SUBTALAR JOINT; OPEN REDUCTION; BONE	Introduction: Both the overall shape of the calcaneus and anatomical reduction of joint congruity are important prognostic factors. However, there is a significant lack of biomechanical data supporting the clinical importance of calcaneus height, length and heel width. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of abnormal calcaneus morphology on ankle-hindfoot biomechanics. Hypothesis :The normal biomechanics of the ankle-hindfoot would be severely disrupted by the abnormal calcaneus morphology. Materials and methods: Fifteen human cadaveric feet were evaluated intact and post-osteotomy after application of a 20 N load. The kinematics of the ankle-hindfoot were compared between normal and simulated calcaneal fractures with reductions in calcaneal height, widening of the heel and shortening of the calcaneal length. In finite element analysis, static loading was simulated at an axial load with the subtalar joint in a neutral position, and the effects of the injured calcaneus on the contact characteristics of the subtalar joints were evaluated in terms of the contact areas, peak contact pressures and pressure distributions. Results: The increases in calcaneal width somewhat limited subtalar motion, and the reductions in length mainly limited external rotation and plantar flexion of the subtalar joint. However, the reductions in height mainly resulted in subtalar rotatory instability. The increases in width somewhat broadened the contact area but more notably increased the high-pressure contact zone. With height loss, the overall contact area decreased, and the contact pressure center shifted to the anteroinferior portion of articulation. However, the contact pressure peak remained almost constant. Discussion: The normal biomechanics of the ankle-hindfoot were severely disrupted by the abnormal calcaneus morphology, and reestablishment of the geometric parameters of the calcaneus could restore the relative positions of the 3 superior calcaneal facets and minimize subtalar pain associated with the development of arthrosis and stiffness. Therefore, the 3D calcaneus anatomy should be carefully restored in patients with no risk factors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The Measurement Methods of Movement and Grip Strength in Children with a Previous Upper Extremity Fracture: A Comparative, Prospective Research	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article						Dynamometer; goniometer; measuring; upper extremity; fracture; computer-assisted method	SUPRACONDYLAR HUMERAL FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; AGREEMENT; RELIABILITY	Background and Aims: Decreased range of motion of the elbow and forearm and decreased grip strength are potential findings following a childhood upper extremity fracture. Clinical follow-up is essential because spontaneous improvement is seen several months after the injury. Freehand measuring with a goniometer and hydraulic dynamometer is used to evaluate clinical result. The new methods are justified in avoiding human typewriting errors, thus improving patient safety. Nevertheless, their feasibility in child patients is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate congruence between the computer-assisted and the free-hand measuring methods. Materials and Methods: A total of 59 children with a previous supracondylar humerus fracture were clinically examined by means of free-hand (transparent goniometer and hydraulic dynamometer; Jamar, Lafayette Ltd.) and computer-assisted (E-Link System Packages, Biometrics Ltd.) methods. The range of motion and grip strength were measured separately using both methods. Agreement between the measurements was evaluated using the Bland-Altman method. Results: The results between the two methods were incongruent and the differences between measurements increased along with the mean of measurements in all categories except elbow extension. Rotational range of motions were smaller and grip strength was weaker while measuring with the computer-assisted method. The mean discrepancy was 0.97 degrees (95% confidence interval = -2.46 to 0.53) for elbow extension and 7.97 degrees (95% confidence interval = 6.60-9.33) for elbow flexion. Conclusions: Grip strength is used to evaluate impairment of hand function. The study method showed slightly lower results in grip strength. Range of motion is essential when evaluating the outcome of supracondylar humerus fracture, while >10 degrees of change in elbow range of motion associate with impaired function. As compared with the gold-standard goniometer, the methods were not congruent. However, all differences were under 10 degrees and probably beyond clinical importance. Because of its advantages in recording the outcomes to electronical charts, the computer-assisted method is recommended option in performing the follow-up of complicated pediatric supracondylar humerus fractures.

Limb length discrepancy (LLD) cannot be corrected by vascularized fibular grafting and the use of Ilizarov distraction is associated with a high rate of complications. The aim of this study was to report the long-term follow-up of a combined technique previously published under the name "telescoping vascularized fibular graft". Materials and methods:Eleven patients operated at an average age of 10.2 +/- 3.2 years were reviewed. All cases were Crawford type IV affected by neurofibromatosis 1. Nine patients had an average of 4.3 previous operations. Preoperative LLD averaged 7.9 +/- 2.5 cm. Results:Follow-up averaged 10 +/- 5.4 years. Seven cases (63.6%) reached skeletal maturity before final follow-up. Primary union was achieved in all cases after an average of 7.2 +/- 1.3 months. Full weightbearing was possible after an average of 10.6 +/- 2.2 months. Recurrent stress fractures occurred in 9 cases (81.8%) and healed with casting in 6 cases and required internal fixation in 3 cases. Eight cases (72.8%) developed tibial shaft deformities, mainly procurvatum that required corrective osteotomy in 2 cases. Final LLD averaged 2.7 +/- 1.3 cm. Complete tibialization of the graft was achieved after an average of 17.0 +/- 3.6 months. Valgus deformity of the ipsilateral ankle averaged 12.4 degrees +/- 7.5. Conclusion:The presented technique avoids osteotomy of the diseased bone and allows simultaneous treatment of the pseudarthrosis and correction of shortening. Compared with conventional bone transport, it requires shorter time of frame application and therefore better patient tolerability because there is no waiting for consolidation of the regenerate. The dis-impaction of the doweled fibula occurs proximally, allowing the less active site located at the distal aspect of the pseudarthrosis to heal without displacement. A shortcoming of the presented technique is the more propensity for axial deviation and refractures that seldom require surgery.

JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article							FRACTURES; SOFTWARE	Purpose: Bilateral orbital volume (OV) symmetry is imperative for successful orbital reconstruction to prevent complications such as enophthalmos, diplopia, and orbital dystopia. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of surgeon-led in-house OV calculation for reconstructed orbits after orbital floor fracture. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective cross-sectional observational study of maxillofacial computed tomography scans for patients undergone orbital fracture repair by Emory Oral and Maxillofa-cial service at Grady Memorial Hospital (Atlanta, Georgia) from 2018 to 2020.The primary predictor variable was OV calculation approach (outsourced vs surgeon-led in-house approach). The primary outcome variable was OV. Secondary variables were age, gender, and race. Interobserver reliability was calculated with a 2-way mixed-effects model, intraclass correlation coefficients, 95% confidence intervals, and P values. Differences between OV (in-house and outsourced) were calculated using student t-test. Statis-tical significance was determined at P < .05. Results: During the study period, 172 patients sustained orbital floor fracture. Of them, 49 patients (31 male, 18 females; 98 orbits) with the mean age of 41.3 years (range, 19 to 89 years) met inclusion criteria. Subjects with incomplete medical records and inadequate computed tomography scans were excluded from the study. The racial distribution in descending order was 87.8% African American, 8.2% Caucasian, 2% Hispanic, and 2% Asian. There was excellent inter-rater reliability for calculating uninjured OV (OV-U, P < .0001) and reconstructed OV (OV-R, P < .0001). The mean OV difference of outsourced approach was 0.8 cm(3) and for surgeon-led in-house approach was 0.07 cm(3). There was no significant difference in OV difference between outsourced and in-house approach (P = .16). Conclusions: In conclusion, using open-source 3-dimensional imaging software is a reliable and a pre-dictable method at calculating reconstructed OV in patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation of orbital fractures. By having this software in our personal computers and laptops, one can easily calculate OVs in an efficient manner.

Despite targeted therapies, the bone marrow involvement remains a challenge in treating aggressive B-NHLs, partly due to the protective interactions of lymphoma cells with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). However, data elucidating the relationship between MSCs and B-NHLs are limited and inconclusive due to the lack of reproducible in vitro three-dimensional (3D) models. Here, we developed and described a size-controlled and stable 3D hybrid spheroids of Ri-1 (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, DLBCL) and RAJI (Burkitt lymphoma, BL) cells with HS-5 fibroblasts to facilitate research on the crosstalk between B-NHL cells and MSCs. Materials and Methods: We applied the commercially available agarose hydrogel microwells for a fast, low-cost, and reproducible hybrid lymphoma/stromal spheroids formation. Standard histological automated procedures were used for formalin fixation and paraffin embedding (FFPE) of 3D models to produce good quality slides for histopathology and immunohistochemical staining. Next, we tested the effect of the anti-cancer drugs: doxorubicin (DOX) and ibrutinib (IBR) on mono-cultured and co-cultured B-NHLs with the use of alamarBlue and live/dead cell fluorescence based assays to confirm their relevancy for drug testing studies. Results: We optimized the conditions for B-NHLs spheroid formation in both: a cell line-specific and application-specific manner. Lymphoma cells aggregate into stable spheroids when co-cultured with stromal cells, of which internal architecture was driven by selforganization. Furthermore, we revealed that co-culturing of lymphoma cells with stromal cells significantly reduced IBR-induced apoptosis compared to the 3D mono-culture. Conclusion: This article provides details for generating 3D B-NHL spheroids for the studies on the lymphoma- stromal cells. This approach makes it suitable to assess in a relevant in vitro model the activity of new therapeutic agents in B-NHLs.

They are associated with longer post-operative hospital stays, additional surgical procedures, risk of treatment in intensive care units and higher mortality. Material and methods SSIs were detected in patients hospitalized in a 40-bed orthopaedics ward in 2009-2018. The total number of study patients was 15,678. The results were divided into two 5-year periods before and after the introduction of the SSI prevention plan. The study was conducted as part of a national Healthcare-Associated Infections Surveillance Programme, following the methodology recommended by the HAI-Net, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control Program (ECDC). Results One hundred sixty eight SSIs were detected in total, including 163 deep SSIs (SSI-D). The total SSI incidence rate was 1.1%, but in hip prosthesis: 1.2%, in knee prosthesis: 1.3%, for open reduction of fracture (FX): 1.3%, for close reduction of fracture (CR): 1.5, and 0.8% for other procedures. 64% of SSI-D cases required rehospitalisation. A significantly reduction in incidence was found only after fracture reductions: FX and CR, respectively 2.1% vs. 0.7% (OR 3.1 95%CI 1.4-6.6, p < 0.01) and 2.1 vs. 0.8% (OR 2.4 95%CI 1.0-5.9, p < 0.05). SSI-Ds were usually caused by Gram-positive cocci, specially Staphylococcus aureus, 74 (45.7%); Enterobacteriaceae bacillis accounted for 14.1% and Gram-negative non-fermenting rods for 8.5%. Conclusions The implemented SSI prevention plan demonstrated a significant decrease from 2.1 to 0.7% in SSI-D incidence only in fracture reductions, without changes in epidemiology SSI incidence rates in other procedures. Depending on the epidemiological situation in the ward, it is worthwhile to surveillance of SSIs associated to different types of orthopaedic surgery to assess the risks of SSI and take preventive measures.

Acute, avulsion fractures of the medial epicondyle while throwing in youth baseball players: A variant of Little League elbow	JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY			English	Article						Elbow; medial epicondyle fracture; baseball; growth plate	COLLATERAL LIGAMENT RECONSTRUCTION; HUMERAL EPICONDYLE; VALGUS INSTABILITY; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; RISK-FACTORS; CHILDREN; PITCHERS; INJURIES; SHOULDER; REPAIR	Hypothesis: The young throwing athlete is susceptible to medial elbow injury due to valgus overload. We hypothesized that this injury can occur during the throwing motion with an acute episode of medial elbow pain resulting in an inability to effectively participate in throwing activities In addition, appropriate treatment of acute. medial epicondyle avulsion fractures in baseball players can result in an asymptomatic elbow with subsequent return to play within a year of injury Materials and methods: A case series of all youth baseball players with medial epicondyle avulsion fractures that occurred while throwing were identified We studied several variables, including demographics, adherence to USA Baseball youth pitching recommendations, clinical history, radiographic findings, treatment, and outcome Results: Eight skeletally immature baseball players, who were a mean age of 13 years (range, 11-15 years), presented with medial epicondyle fractures that occurred while throwing. All 8 players experienced sudden pain during throwing, and all 5 players with appropriate age and position qualifications did not conform to the USA Baseball youth pitching recommendations. Anteroposterior radiographs documented average fracture displacement of 5 mm (range, 2 5-10 mm) Rye of 8 players had 5 mm or less of displacement and were selected for nonoperative treatment Three of 8 players had more than 5 mm of displacement and underwent open reduction and internal fixation. All players were able to return to play at an average of 7 6 months (range, 4-10 months). Discussion: Medial epicondyle avulsion fractures can occur with a characteristic acute presentation while throwing in youth baseball players. Prevention may be possible when conforming to established USA Baseball youth pitching recommendations Once an acute medial epicondyle avulsion fracture occurs, these injuries may be managed using published treatment algorithms, with successful return to play in less than 1 year Level of evidence: Level IV.

Material and methods: From 2001 till 2005, seventeen patients were operated on because of unstable type 11 (according to Effendi) hangman's fractures. The patients were treated either with transoral C2-C3 discectomy with plate-cage stabdization or with posterior direct pars screw repair. The plate-cage group (n=9) comprised patients with a mean age of 34 years, and the average follow-up was 42 months. The screw repair group (n = 8) included patients with a mean age of 27 years, and the average follow-up was 2 8 months. X-rays and computed tomography of the spine were performed before the surgery. X-rays were also performed 2 or 3 days after the surgery during the 6(th) week after the surgery as well as at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months thereafter. Fusion and stability of C2 were confirmed on flexion-extension X-rays 6 months after the surgery. Results: In all patients C1-C2 motion was preserved and bone fusion with good cervical spine alignment was achieved. In the plate-cage group, an extension of the head that is needed to reduce flexion types of fracture can cause technical difficulties with the correct plate-cage installation because of interference of the jaw and tongue in the operative field. One patient of the group experienced a chronic infection which was resolved by plate-cage removal. Patients in the screw repair group healed uneventfully without complications. Conclusions: Anterior transoral plate-cage stabilization is indicated for type II fracture with extension displacement and posterior direct pars screw repair for flexion displacement. Nevertheless, posterior direct pars screw repair seems to be safer, cheaper and more technically feasible.

The present study aims to evaluate the quality of reduction, and radiological and functional outcome in displaced acetabular fractures treated conservatively. Materials and Methods: Sixty-nine patients (55 men and 14 women) with 71 displaced acetabular fractures (mean age 38.6 years) managed conservatively were retrospectively evaluated. There were 11 posterior wall, 5 posterior column, 6 anterior column, 13 transverse, 2 posterior column with posterior wall, 9 transverse with posterior wall, 6 T-shaped, 1 anterior column with posterior hemi-transverse, and 18 both-column fractures. The follow-up radiographs were graded according to the criteria developed by Matta J. Functional outcome was assessed using Harris hip score and Merle dAubigne and Postel score at final followup. Average follow-up was 4.34 years (range 2-11 years). Results: Patients with congruent reduction (n=45) had good or excellent functional outcome. Radiologic outcome in incongruent reduction (n=26) was good or excellent in 6 and fair or poor in 20 hips. The functional outcome in patients with incongruent reduction was good or excellent in 16 and satisfactory or poor in 10 hips. Good to excellent radiologic and functional outcome was achieved in all patients with posterior wall fractures including four having more than 50 of broken wall. Good to excellent functional outcome was observed in 88.8 of both-column fractures with secondary congruence despite medial subluxation. Conclusions: Nonoperative treatment of acetabular fractures can give good radiological and functional outcome in congruent reduction. Posterior wall fractures with a congruous joint without subluxation on computed tomography axial section, posterior column, anterior column, infratectal transverse or T-shaped, and both-column fractures may be managed conservatively. Small osteochondral fragments in the cotyloid fossa or non-weight-bearing part of the hip with a congruous joint do not seem to adversely affect the functional outcome. Displaced transverse fractures with "V" sign may require operative treatment.

For elderly patients with osteoporotic bone quality, however, primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) with the advantage of immediate postoperative mobilization might be an option. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of surgical treatment of displaced osteoporotic acetabular fractures using the acetabular roof reinforcement plate (ARRP) combined with THA. Materials and methods Between 2009 and 2019, 84 patients were operated using the ARRP combined with THA. Inclusion criteria were displaced osteoporotic fractures of the acetabulum with or without previous hemi- or total hip arthroplasty, age above 65 years, and pre-injury ability to walk at least with use of a walking frame. Of the 84 patients, 59 could be followed up after 6 months clinically and radiographically. Forty-nine (83%) were primary fractures and 10 (17%) periprosthetic acetabular fractures. Results The mean age was 80.5 years (range 65-98 years). The average time from injury to surgery was 8.5 days (range 1-28). Mean time of surgery was 167 min (range 100-303 min). Immediate postoperative full weight bearing (FWB) was allowed for 51 patients (86%). At the 6-month follow-up, all 59 patients except one showed bony healing and incorporation of the ARRP. One case developed a non-union of the anterior column. No disruption, breakage or loosening of the ARRP was seen. Additional CT scans performed in 18 patients confirmed bony healing. Twenty-six patients (44%) had regained their pre-injury level of mobility. Complications requiring revision surgery occurred in 8 patients. Five of them were suffering from a prosthetic head dislocation, one from infection, one from hematoma and one from a heterotopic ossification. Conclusions The ARRP has proven to provide sufficient primary stability to allow for immediate FWB in most cases and represents a valuable option for the surgical management of displaced acetabular fractures in this challenging patient group.

ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Plateau fracture; ORIF; Post-traumatic arthritis; Alignment		Introduction Several studies have reported that total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a suitable solution to treat elderly patients with complex tibial plateau fractures. The purpose of the present study was to compare surgical treatment outcomes after open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) between elderly and younger patients. Materials and methods We reviewed patients with plateau fracture (OTA/AO classification types 41B and 41C) who underwent ORIF at two academic trauma centers between November 2006 and October 2019. Of the 341 patients, 76 were ultimately included in the younger group (< 60 years old) and 77 in the elderly group (>= 60 years). The average follow-up was 24 months (range 12-96 months). The primary outcome was any common complication of plateau fracture, namely post-traumatic arthritis and alignment change. Conversion to TKA, Reduction loss, coronal malalignment, non-union, union time, infection, and limb length discrepancy (LLD) were also assessed. Results The elderly group had a significantly higher prevalence of diabetes, but there were no other significant differences between the groups in terms of patient demographics, fracture characteristics, and operation characteristics. We detected no differences between the groups in terms of post-traumatic arthritis (p = 0.216), alignment change (p = 0.093), conversion to TKA (p = 0.681), reduction loss (p = 0.079), coronal malalignment (p = 0.484), non-union rate (p = 0.719), infection (p = 0.063), LLD (p = 0.154), or time to union (p = 0.513). Logistic regression analysis revealed that age > 60 years was not associated with treatment failure, defined as either post-traumatic arthritis greater than grade II or non-union (p = 0.468). OTA/AO classification type 41C2 (p = 0.019), type 41C3 (p = 0.008), and malreduction (p = 0.050) were significant risk factors for failure. Conclusion Age >= 60 years is not an independent risk factor of poor radiographic outcome and high complication rate in tibial plateau fractures. This indicates that ORIF is still a good solution to treat elderly patients, similar to their younger counterparts.

Osteogenic and antimicrobial nanoparticulate calcium phosphate and poly-(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) powders for the treatment of osteomyelitis	MATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING C-MATERIALS FOR BIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Calcium phosphate; Controlled drug delivery; Osteogenesis; Osteomyelitis; Poly-lactide-co-glycolide; Staphylococcus aureus	FRACTURE FIXATION IMPLANTS; PHASE-COMPOSITION CONTROL; DRUG-DELIVERY KINETICS; MC3T3-E1 CELLS; IN-VITRO; BONE; RELEASE; DIFFERENTIATION; HYDROXYAPATITE; PROLIFERATION	Development of a material for simultaneous sustained and localized delivery of antibiotics and induction of spontaneous regeneration of hard tissues affected by osteomyelitis stands for an important clinical need. In this work, a comparative analysis of the bacterial and osteoblastic cell response to two different nanoparticulate carriers of clindamycin, an antibiotic commonly prescribed in the treatment of bone infection, one composed of calcium phosphate and the other comprising poly-(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide)-coated calcium phosphate, was carried out Three different non-cytotoxic phases of calcium phosphate, exhibiting dissolution and drug release profiles in the range of one week to two months to one year, respectively, were included in the analysis: monetite, amorphous calcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite. Spherical morphologies and narrow size distribution of both types of nanopowders were confirmed in transmission and scanning electron microscopic analyses. The antibiotic-containing powders exhibited sustained drug release contingent upon the degradation rate of the carrier. Assessment of the antibacterial performance of the antibiotic-encapsulated powders against Staphylococcus aureus, the most common pathogen isolated from infected bone, yielded satisfactory results both in broths and on blood agar plates for all the analyzed powders. In contrast, no cytotoxic behavior was detected upon the incubation of the antibiotic powders with the osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cell line for up to three weeks. The cells were shown to engage in a close contact with the antibiotic-containing particles, irrespective of their internal or surface phase composition, polymeric or mineral. At the same time, both types of particles upregulated the expression of osteogenic markers osteocalcin, osteopontin, Runx2 and protocollagen type I, suggesting their ability to promote osteogenesis and enhance remineralization of the infected site in addition to eliminating the bacterial source of infection.

Background Data: Bone cutting without aggravating thermal side effects has been demonstrated with scanning CO2-laser osteotomy. Further research is necessary to develop a clinically usable laser osteotome, which may allow new types of bone surgical procedures. Materials and Methods: The scanning parameters for performing tibial osteotomies were determined in preliminary ex vivo trials. Osteotomies were performed in the mid-diaphysis of sheep tibia using either the prototype laser osteotome (osteoLAS, study group; n = 12), or an oscillating saw ( control group; n = 12). Both groups were divided into two subgroups each ( n = 6), and the two groups were sacrificed after 4 and 12 wk. Radiographs were taken postoperatively and after 4, 8, and 12 wk to compare the course of bone healing. Results: Laser osteotomies of sheep tibia up to a depth of 20 mm were possible without visible thermal damage to the bone. A sequential PC-controlled cut geometry with artificial widening of the osteotomy gap was required for a complete osteotomy. Both clinically and radiologically, the laser and control groups showed undisturbed primary gap healing. Bone healing was similar and undelayed after both laser osteotomy and osteotomy done by mechanical saw. Conclusions: Osteotomy of multi-layered bones with a scanning CO2-laser demonstrates clinical and radiological healing patterns comparable to those seen with osteotomy done by standard mechanical instruments. It is, however, a technically demanding procedure, and complete laser osteotomies of long bones are only reasonable in bones with a diameter < 20 mm, which will likely restrict the use of this technique to bones 7 - 10 mm thick. Through the use of computer guidance, extremely precise osteotomies and sophisticated cut geometries are possible using this technique. For practical applications, precise control of the depth of laser cutting and easier manipulation of the osteotome are required.

Many guidelines (GLs) are available on antibiotic prophylaxis as an effective preventive measure; however, these GLs are often ignored in practice. A surveillance study of SSIs in arthroplasty, promoted by the Italian Study Group of Hospital Hygiene of the Italian Society of Public Health (SitI), showed a high percentage of non-adherence to GLs on antibiotic prophylaxis. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to review the existing GLs, share them within the hospital and then monitor their implementation. Materials and methods: Information and training are considered to be great tools for implementation and sharing of GLs, which leads to significant improvements in clinical practice. A multidisciplinary team comprising infectious disease specialists, orthopaedic surgeons, nurse epidemiologists and public health specialists was established at the G. Pini Hospital in Milan to revise GLs, and to organise educational events for their implementation, sharing and dissemination. A checklist was devised for monitoring purposes. Results: GLs were presented to orthopaedic surgeons and nurse coordinators during two educational events. Meetings were organised in each unit to present the results of the surveillance of SSIs in arthroplasty and to discuss the reasons why the prophylaxis regimens adopted were not consistent with GLs. It was emphasised that the most important issue, on which there is consensus in the scientific literature, was related to the duration of prophylaxis beyond 24 h. The review process for GLs was presented and pocket-sized GLs were given to surgeons. The importance of documenting on medical record any deviations from the GLs was emphasised. Conclusions: Any changes in behaviour in clinical practice must be monitored and evaluated regularly. The monitoring of GLs in terms of correct choice of drug, timing of administration and duration of prophylaxis is made using a special checklist on a representative sample of medical records.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the Summed Pain Intensity Difference over 48 hours (SPID48). Secondary efficacy endpoints included sum of time-weighted pain intensity differences (SPID) values at other timepoints/intervals, time to first use of rescue analgesia, and number of rescue doses taken. Safety assessments included the incidence of adverse events (AEs), physical examinations, laboratory tests, 12-lead electrocardiography, and wound healing.Results:Patients randomized to meloxicam IV 30mg exhibited a statistically significant difference in SPID48 versus the placebo group (P=0.0034). Statistically significant differences favoring meloxicam IV over placebo were also observed for secondary efficacy endpoints, including SPID at other times/intervals (SPID6: P=0.0153; SPID12: P=0.0053; SPID24: P=0.0084; and SPID24-48: P=0.0050) and first use of rescue medication (P=0.0076). Safety findings indicated that meloxicam IV 30mg was generally well tolerated; no serious AEs or bleeding events were observed. Most AEs were assessed by the investigator to be mild in intensity, and no patients discontinued due to AEs. There were no meaningful differences between the study groups in vital signs, electrocardiographic findings, or laboratory assessments. In most cases, investigators found that wound healing followed a normal course and mean wound-healing satisfaction scores were similar for meloxicam IV 30mg and placebo.Discussion:Meloxicam IV doses of 30mg provided effective pain relief when administered once daily by bolus injection to patients with moderate-to-severe pain following bunionectomy, and had an acceptable safety profile.

The 6 treatment groups included titanium mesh or PEEK corpectomy devices filled with rhBMP-2 on a compression-resistant matrix (CRM) carrier; rhBMP-2 in a morselized absorbable collagen sponge (ACS) carrier combined with resorbable ceramic granules; and autograft.Objective.The aim of this study was to determine fusion rates associated with 2 different preparations of rhBMP-2 as well as autograft in an instrumented ovine lumbar corpectomy model 6 months postoperatively.Summary of Background Data.Vertebral reconstruction with corpectomy devices requires bone graft. Bone graft substitutes have the potential to avoid a second operation, donor site pain, and attendant morbidity associated with autograft.Methods.Twenty-four sheep in 6 treatment groups underwent lumbar corpectomy via a retroperitoneal trans-psoas approach. Spines were reconstructed with autograft, rhBMP-2 on a CRM, or rhBMP-2 on an ACS mixed with ceramic granules. Grafting materials were placed in either a titanium mesh or PEEK conduit in spines with internal fixation. Computed tomographic (CT) scans were evaluated for fusion. Undecalcified histology was used to evaluate for fusion as well as the amount and extent of graft incorporation and graft resorption.Results.Regardless of corpectomy device used, rhBMP-2/CRM or rhBMP-2/ACS with MASTERGRAFT resulted in a 100% fusion rate. The autograft group had a lower (75%) radiographic fusion rate. Using either preparation of rhBMP-2 resulted in the length of the defect filling with solid bone. Autograft fragments and ceramic granules were incorporated into the fusion masses with much of the ceramic granules being resorbed by 6 months.Conclusion.Both of the rhBMP-2 formulations have the potential to effect bony fusion and vertebral reconstruction within the corpectomy devices.Level of Evidence: N/A	[Toth, Jeffrey M.] Med Coll Wisconsin Inc, Dept Orthopaed Surg, 9200W Wisconsin Ave Box 26099, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA; [Schwartz, David G.] OrthoIndy, Indianapolis, IN USA; [Mobasser, Jean-Pierre] Goodman Campbell Brain & Spine, Indianapolis, IN USA; [Williams, Joseph] Orthoped Ctr Illinois, Springfield, IL USA	Goodman Campbell Brain & Spine	Toth, JM (corresponding author), Med Coll Wisconsin Inc, Dept Orthopaed Surg, 9200W Wisconsin Ave Box 26099, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA.	jtoth@mcw.edu		Toth, Jeffrey/0000-0003-3000-7230	Medtronic Spinal and Biologics	Medtronic Spinal and Biologics	Medtronic Spinal and Biologics funds were received in support of this work.		27	0	0	1	12	LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS	PHILADELPHIA	TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA	0362-2436	1528-1159		SPINE	SPINE	MAR	2016	41	6					E313	E322		10.1097/BRS.0000000000001256	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/BRS.0000000000001256			10	Clinical Neurology; Orthopedics	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Neurosciences & Neurology; Orthopedics	DK3AB	26536446				2024-11-09	WOS:000374786100002

The study examined condylar positional, structural, and volumetric changes after bimaxillary or single-jaw maxillary orthognathic surgeries in skeletal Class III patients using the cone-beam computed tomography. Materials and Methods: Presurgical, postsurgical, and one-year post-surgical full field of view (FOV) cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images of 44 patients with skeletal Class III deformities were obtained. Group 1 underwent a bimaxillary surgery (28 patients: 24 females and 4 males), with mean age at the time of surgery being 23.8 +/- 6.0 years, and Group 2 underwent maxillary single-jaw surgery (16 patients: 8 females and 8 males), with mean age at the time of surgery being 23.7 +/- 5.1 years. After the orthognathic surgery, the CBCT images of 88 condyles were evaluated to assess their displacement and radiological signs of bone degeneration. Three-dimensional (3D) condylar models were constructed and superimposed pre- and postoperatively to compare changes in condylar volume. Results: Condylar position was found to be immediately altered after surgery in the maxillary single-jaw surgery group, but at the one-year follow-up, the condyles returned to their pre-surgical position. There was no significant difference in condylar position when comparing between pre-surgery and one-year follow-up in any of the study groups. Condylar rotations in the axial and coronal planes were significant in the bimaxillary surgery group. No radiological signs of condylar bone degeneration were detected one year after the surgery. Changes in condylar volume after surgery were found to be insignificant in both study groups. Conclusions: At one year after orthognathic surgery, there were no significant changes in positional, structural, or volumetric statuses of condyles.

The present study evaluated (I) postoperative surgical site infection and the risk of early infection following THA in posttraumatic hip joints after acetabular fractures and (II) the discriminatory ability of preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) blood levels for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). Materials and Methods Patients were included who had undergone THA (2014-2019) after prior ORIF, and nonsurgically treated acetabular fractures. Patients' demographics and the duration between fracture and THA implantation were assessed. Preoperative diagnostic testing (laboratory results, hip aspirations) as well as the results of intraoperative microbiological swabs and sonication were also evaluated. Postoperative complications were recorded. Results Sixty-seven patients (51 men/16 women) were included, with a mean age of 54.7 +/- 14.0 years (range: 18.0-82.9). The mean time between acetabular fracture and THA was 13.5 +/- 14.9 years (0.2-53.5). Four subgroups were classified: subgroup I (nonsurgical, n = 15), subgroup II (complete removal of osteosynthesis, n = 8), subgroup III (partial removal of osteosynthesis, n = 15), and subgroup IV (remaining osteosynthesis, n = 29). Preoperative CRP blood levels were normal. CRP levels had no discriminatory ability to predict PJI (AUC: 0.43). Positive microbiological swabs were assessed in subgroups III (n = 1) and IV (n = 2). Complications during follow-up occurred in subgroups I (one aseptic loosening [6.7%]), III (one wound revision [6.7%], two low-grade infections [13.3%]), and IV (three low-grade infections [10.3%]). Conclusion High infection rates were found in patients with THA after acetabular fracture with remaining implants or partial implant removal. Serum CRP alone seems to be a poor predictor. Therefore, an extensive diagnostic algorithm can help to detect an occult infection, including preoperative hip aspiration (microbiological samples and measurements of synovial CRP, WBC, and alpha-defensin levels). Intraoperative tissue samples and sonication results should be obtained during THA implantation.

The highest risk of developing SSI is carried by operations involving implants, such as: hip prosthesis (HPRO), knee prosthesis (KPRO), open reduction of fracture (FX), and closed reduction of fracture with internal fixation (CR). Objectives. The objective of the study was to assess the incidence of SSI in patients subjected to HPRO, KPRO, FX, and CR procedures in orthopaedics and trauma wards in 2014-2018 considering risk factors included in the SIR index. Materials and Methods: The study included 6261 patients who were subjected to orthopaedic surgery in 2014-2018. The investigation covered three hospitals with orthopaedics and trauma wards. The research was conducted in the framework of the national HAI surveillance programme according to the methodology of the HAI-Net, ECDC. Results: A total of 6261 surgeries were investigated, of which 111 cases of SSI were detected. The incidence was 1.8%; HPRO (incidence 2.1%, median (Me) surgery duration 90 min, and standardized infection ratio (SIR) above 1 in all units tested); KPRO (incidence 2.0%, Me 103 min, and SIR above 1 for all units tested); FX (incidence 1.9%, Me 70 min, and SIR above 1 for two units tested and below 1 in one unit); CR (incidence 1.0%, Me 55 min, and SIR-not calculated). The etiological agents that were most frequently isolated from patients with SSI were Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Conclusions: HPRO, KPRO, and FX operations performed in the studied wards carried a higher risk of developing SSI than that predicted by SIR. SSIs accounted for a significant percentage of the overall infection pool in CR surgeries. Actions should be undertaken to reduce the incidence of SSI in these surgeries. There should be a hospital network which facilitates cooperation in order to better monitor and analyse the incidence of SSI.

Newer generation of proximal tibia locking plates demonstrate large variability in their ability to capture the posteromedial fragment in bicondylar tibial plateau fractures	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Posteromedial fragment; Bicondylar tibial plateau; Lateral locked proximal tibia plate; Capture rate	LESS INVASIVE STABILIZATION; BIOMECHANICAL ANALYSIS; INTERNAL-FIXATION; SINGLE; MORPHOLOGY; OUTCOMES	Introduction: The early generations of proximal tibial locking plates demonstrated inferior results when compared to dual plating in bicondylar tibial plateau fractures with posteromedial fragments (PMF). Modern plates have multiple rows of locking screws and variable angle technology -which tote the ability to capture the PMF. The purpose of this study was to determine if the modern plates could capture the PMF in a large series of bicondylar tibial plateau fractures. Materials & methods: Axial computer topography (CT) scans of 114 bicondylar tibial plateau fractures with PMF were analyzed. Five proximal tibia locking plates-in seven total configurations-were applied to radiopaque tibiae models. All possible screws were placed. Templates of screw trajectories were created based on the model CT scans. These were superimposed onto patient CT scan images to assess for screw penetration into the PMF. Number of screws fully within the PMF were recorded. Capture of the PMF was defined as having at least two screws within the fragment. Results: On average, all plates were able to capture 81.6% of PMF with an average of 3.77 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 3.47-4.07] screws. However, their ability to capture all fragments varied greatly, from 55.7%95.2% in fixed angle constructs. Overall, variable angle constructs had a significantly higher capture rate (98.5% vs. 74.9%; p < 0.0 0 01) and more screws in the PMF (5.88 [95% CI: 5.58-6.17] vs 2.93 [95% CI: 2.623.24]; p < 0.0 0 01) when compared to fixed angle constructs. Conclusion: Newer generation locking plates vary greatly in their ability to capture the PMF. Variable angle technology dramatically increases the ability to capture the majority of PMFs. Prior biomechanical and clinical studies may yield substantially different results if repeated with these newer implants. Use of newer generation locked plates should not replace thorough preoperative planning. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Radial head fracture; Metal prosthesis; Radial head resection; Elbow instability	TERM-FOLLOW-UP; LONG-TERM; INTERNAL-FIXATION; CLOSED FRACTURE; DEFICIENT ELBOW; III FRACTURES; EXCISION; ARTHROPLASTY; REPLACEMENT; NECK	Introduction: At present, surgical treatment of comminuted radial head fractures without associated instability continues to be controversial. When anatomical reconstruction is not possible, radial head excision is performed. However, the appearance of long-term complications with this technique, along with the development of new radial head implants situates arthroplasty as a promising surgical alternative. The purpose of the present study was to compare the mid-term functional outcomes of both techniques. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was performed between 2002 and 2011 on 25 Mason type-III fractures, 11 patients treated with primary radial head resection and 14 who received treatment of the fracture with metal prosthesis. At the end of follow-up, patients were contacted and outcomes evaluated according to: Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS), the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score (DASH) and strength measurement. Radiographic assessment (proximal migration of the radius, osteoarthritic changes, and signs of prosthesis loosening) was also performed. Results: The average age of the sample was 53.7 years in the resection group, and 54.4 years in the replacement group, with a mean follow-up of 60.3 and 42 months respectively. According to the MEPS scale, there were 6 excellent cases, 3 good and 2 acceptable in the resection group, and 6 excellent cases, 3 good, 3 acceptable, and 2 poor in the prosthesis group. The mean DASH score were 13.5, and 24.8 for the resection and the replacement group respectively. We found one postoperative complication in the resection group (stiffness and valgus instability) and 6 in the replacement group: 3 of joint stiffness, 1 case of prosthesis breakage, and 2 neurological injuries. Conclusions: Although this is a retrospective study, the high complication rate occurring after radial head replacement in comparison with radial head resection, as well as good functional results obtained with this last technique, leads us to recommend it for comminuted radial head fractures without associated instability.

Risk of Radiation-Induced Malignancy With Heterotopic Ossification Prophylaxis: A Case-Control Analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS			English	Article							ACETABULAR FRACTURES; BENIGN DISEASES; BONE-FORMATION; CANCER; RADIOTHERAPY; PREVENTION; IRRADIATION; EXPOSURE; THERAPY	Purpose: To determine the risk of radiation-induced malignancy after prophylactic treatment for heterotopic ossification (HO). Methods and Materials: A matched case-control study was conducted within a population-based cohort of 3489 patients treated either for acetabular fractures with acetabular open reduction internal fixation or who underwent total hip arthroplasty from 1990 to 2009. Record-linkage techniques identified patients who were diagnosed with a malignancy from our state health registry. Patients with a prior history of malignancy were excluded from the cohort. For each documented case of cancer, 2 controls were selected by stratified random sampling from the cohort that did not develop a malignancy. Matching factors were sex, age at time of hip treatment, and duration of follow-up. Results: A total of 243 patients were diagnosed with a malignancy after hip treatment. Five patients were excluded owing to inadequate follow-up time in the corresponding control cohort. A cohort of 238 cases (control, 476 patients) was included. Mean follow-up was 10 years, 12 years in the control group. In the cancer cohort, 4% of patients had radiation therapy (RT), compared with 7% in the control group. Of the 9 patients diagnosed with cancer after RT, none occurred within the field. The mean latency period was 5.9 years in the patients who received RT and 6.6 years in the patients who did not. Median (range) age at time of cancer diagnosis in patients who received RT was 62 (43-75) years, compared with 70 (32-92) years in the non-RT patients. An ad hoc analysis was subsequently performed in all 2749 patients who were not matched and found neither an increased incidence of malignancy nor a difference in distribution of type of malignancy. Conclusion: We were unable to demonstrate an increased risk of malignancy in patients who were treated with RT for HO prophylaxis compared with those who were not. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Augmentation with a surgical mesh may permanently reinforce the repair and decrease failure rates. The purpose of this study is to assess the postoperative outcomes of open RCR augmented with a novel reticulated polycarbonate polyurethane patch. Materials and methods: Ten patients with supraspinatus tendon tears underwent open RCR augmented with a polycarbonate polyurethane patch secured in a 6-point fixation construct placed over the repaired tendon. Patients were evaluated with preoperative and postoperative outcome measures, including the Simple Shoulder Test, visual analog pain scale, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons shoulder score, Cumulative Activities of Daily Living score, and University of California, Los Angeles shoulder scale, as well as range of motion. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate repair status. Results: Patients showed significant improvements in visual analog pain scale, Simple Shoulder Test, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons shoulder scores at both 6 and 12 months postoperatively (P < .05 and P < .01, respectively). The University of California, Los Angeles postoperative score was good to excellent in 7 patients at 6 months and in 8 patients at 12 months. Range of motion in forward flexion, abduction, internal rotation, and external rotation was significantly improved at both 6 and 12 months postoperatively (P < .05 and P < .01, respectively). Magnetic resonance imaging at 12 months showed healing in 90%; one patient had a definitive persistent tear. We found no adverse events associated with the patch, including the absence of fibrosis, mechanical symptoms, or visible subacromial adhesions. Discussion: The polycarbonate polyurethane patch was designed to support tissue in growth and enhance healing as shown by preclinical animal studies. Clinically, the patch is well tolerated and shows promising efficacy, with a 10% retear rate at the 12-month time point. Level of evidence: Level IV, Case Series, Treatment Study.

Objective To describe the demographics, mechanism of injury and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of lesser tuberosity avulsion fractures in children. Materials and methods A retrospective search of children with lesser tuberosity avulsion fractures on MRI was done. Available radiographs were evaluated. Demographics, mechanism of injury, MRI characteristics and treatment were recorded. Results Thirteen children, all male, were included (median age: 13.8 years, range: 12.5-16.8 years). The most common mechanism was blunt, overhead or hyperextension traumatic injury related to sports. All patients were skeletally immature and 10/13 demonstrated isolated avulsion fractures at the footprint. Only one patient had associated osteochondral injury to the humeral head and labral tear. Two children demonstrated medial dislocation/subluxation of the biceps tendon. The median size of the avulsed fragment was 15 mm (range: 5-29 mm), median anteroposterior displacement was 3 mm (range: 0-6 mm) and medial displacement was 1 mm (range: 0-20 mm). There was no correlation between age and the size of the avulsed fragment (P=0.29). Common injury patterns were complete avulsion of the subscapularis footprint (6/13) and partial avulsion of inferior footprint (6/13). Two-thirds of the radiographs were initially reported as normal, but retrospectively showed two missed fractures. One of the initial radiographs raised concern for bone tumor. The best view for identifying an avulsion fragment was the axillary view. Seven patients of the 13 patients underwent internal fixation. Conclusion Avulsion fractures of the lesser tuberosity are rare, challenging to diagnose and often radiographically occult. MRI can identify the injury at the subscapularis tendon footprint with variable size and displacement. The long head of the biceps tendon is usually normal in location. Although this entity is rare, radiologists should be aware of it to allow for correct and prompt diagnosis and prevent unnecessary biopsy or contrast administration.

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy of a new bone grafting method-transverse bone grafting (TBG)-with iliac bone grafting (IBG) and titanium mesh grafting (TMG) in the treatment of single-segment thoracic spinal tuberculosis. Material and methods TBG was undertaken in 30 patients (group A), IBG was carried out in 28 patients (group B), and TMG was performed in 36 patients (group C). The operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage amount, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) level, visual analog scale (VAS) score for back pain, Oswestry dysfunction index (ODI), intervertebral height, and time to bone graft fusion were compared. Changes in the Cobb angle of kyphosis, intervertebral height, and loss to the final follow-up were measured. Neurological function recovery was evaluated according to the criteria of the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA). Results The operative times in group A was significantly shorter than those in groups B and C (P-AB = 0.036, P-AC = 0.005, P-BC = 0.901). The hospital stay in group A was significantly shorter than that in groups B and C (P-AB = 0.022, P-AC = 0.031, P-BC = 0.424). The intraoperative blood loss in group A was significantly less than that in groups B and C (P-AB = 0.045, P-AC = 0.004, P-BC = 0.586). The VAS score, ODI, ESR level, CRP level, Cobb angle of kyphosis, and intervertebral height of the affected segment were significantly improved compared with those before surgery (P < 0.05). Conclusion For the treatment of single-segment thoracic spinal tuberculosis, the new interbody fusion technique using transverse process bone grafting is a safe, reliable, effective, and ideal bone grafting method.

Effects of ligation of lateral intermuscular septum perforating vessels on blood supply to the femur	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Subvastus approach to the femur; Lateral intermuscular septum perforating (LISP) vessels; Blood supply to the femur; Femur fracture; Plate osteosynthesis	INVASIVE STABILIZATION SYSTEM; BIOLOGICAL INTERNAL-FIXATION; DISTAL FEMORAL FRACTURES; PLATE OSTEOSYNTHESIS; NAIL; MALALIGNMENT; EVOLUTION; CONTACT; ARTERY; LISS	Introduction: With a subvastus approach to the femur, the vessels that perforate the lateral intermuscular septum (LISP-vessels) must be ligated. The effect on the blood supply to the femur remains unclear. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effect of ligation of the LISP-Vessels on the blood supply and to examine the anatomy of the LISP-vessels and the anastomoses around the femur. Materials: In six human cadavers the LISP vessels were ligated by a lateral subvastus approach on one side. The contralateral side served as control group. After bilateral injection of different coloured silicon dyes into the lateral and medial circumflex femoral artery (green), deep femoral artery (red) and the superficial femoral artery (blue) dissection was performed bilaterally. The arterial perfusion on both sides was compared and the anatomy of the LISP vessels studied. Results: The medullary perfusion of the femur was not altered by the ligation of the LISP vessels. It did also not lead to a decrease in periosteal vessel filling. The LISP vessels were shown to be a part of a complex and rich anastomotic network and play an important role in the perfusion of the femur and quadriceps muscle group. The ligature could be compensated for by this anastomotic network. Branches to the periosteum separate from the LISP vessels immediately after perforating the lateral intermuscular septum. The linea aspera turned out to be an important area for the femoral blood supply. Discussion and conclusions: Exposure of the femur through a lateral subvastus approach with ligation of LISP vessels causes a certain degree of soft tissue trauma. However, by using a gentle surgical technique the periostal perfusion of the femur can be preserved by a potent anastomotic network after ligation of the LISP vessels if they are not ligated to close to the lateral intermuscular septum and the linea aspera is not unnecessarily exposed.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome of polytrauma patients with acetabular fractures operated with only modified Stoppa approach or in combination with iliac wing approach. MATERIAL AND METHODS Polytrauma patients who suffered from acetabular fractures treated in our hospital during 2008-2018, operated by using only modified Stoppa or in combination with iliac wing approach, were included in the study. The patients were evaluated using Majeed score. Cases with hip replacement due to post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) were summarized. The study group was compared with control group, which was operated through ilioinguinal approach. RESULTS We examined 42 patients (12 women and 30 men; mean age 44 years). Anatomical or satisfactory fracture healing was achieved in 92% of the acetabular fractures. In the study group Majeed score was significantly better (p<0.05). Seven patients from the study group had hip replacement due to PTOA with following results 5 patients (13%) with anatomical or satisfactory reduction and 2 patients (50%) with displacement more than 3 mm of all reductions of acetabular fractures. DISCUSSION In polytrauma patients, the risk of the development of severe PTOA is increased because of high-energy trauma impact and a satisfactory reduction of acetabulum does not always protect against severe PTOA with following necessity for total hip replacement. CONCLUSIONS Our experience with using the modified Stoppa approach and its combination with iliac wing approach shows that these techniques provide better fracture reduction, gain mostly good radiological and functional results, may decrease the risk of development of severe symptomatic hip PTOA and hip replacement in polytrauma patients with both column acetabular fractures. Our results suggest that unsatisfactory reduction of an acetabular fracture is a strong predictor of symptomatic severe PTOA, which is treated by using total hip arthroplasty.

ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Simple fracture; Distal femur fracture; Minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis; Percutaneous cerclage wiring	SUBTROCHANTERIC FEMORAL FRACTURES; STABILIZATION SYSTEM; INTERNAL-FIXATION; MALALIGNMENT; EVOLUTION	Introduction Achieving adequate reduction is difficult when performing minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) in elderly patients with simple distal femur fracture. This study aimed to evaluate the elderly patients who had undergone percutaneous wiring-assisted reduction with MIPO for simple distal femur fractures to determine the effect of this technique on reduction quality and fracture union. Materials and methods Between January 2009 and September 2017, 56 patients (56 femurs) with displaced simple distal femur fractures treated with MIPO at three trauma centers were finally enrolled. The MIPO technique with percutaneous cerclage wire reduction was performed in 25 patients (Group A). Among them, 12 patients had a simple spiral metaphyseal fracture (Group A*). In comparison, MIPO without percutaneous cerclage wire reduction was performed in 31 patients (Group B). Among them, seven patients had a simple spiral metaphyseal fracture (Group B*). Medical records containing surgical records were retrospectively reviewed to investigate demographic data, comorbidities, complications, operative time, and fluoroscopic time. Radiographs were evaluated for assessing the quality of the reduction and fracture union. Results The mean fracture union time of Group A* was 21.7 weeks, which was significantly shorter than that of Group B* (28.6 weeks). The mean coronal and sagittal angulation in Group A* was 0.6 degrees and 0.7 degrees, respectively, which were significantly lesser than those in Group B* (2.4 degrees and 3.2 degrees, respectively). Mean translation in Group A* was 1.43 mm, which was significantly shorter than that in Group B* (3.81 mm). Nonunion occurred in two patients in Group B. Conclusion Surgical treatment of simple spiral distal femur fractures with percutaneous cerclage wiring-assisted reduction and the MIPO technique in elderly patients resulted in better reduction and faster union time. Therefore, this technique could be a good solution if used in accordance with the indication.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether isokinetic pronation strength would decrease considerably after volar locking plating of a DRF, and whether clinical outcomes would be affected by any pronation strength decrease. Materials and methods: Thirty-four patients of mean age of 55 years (range, 21-74 years) underwent bilateral isokinetic testing at 6 months and 1 year after open reduction and internal fixation using volar plating. Isokinetic pronation and supination strengths were compared between the operated and normal sides. Clinical outcomes such as grip strengths, range of motions and disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) scores were evaluated and analysed for any associations with isokinetic results. Results: At 6 months, peak torque and total work values for both pronation and supination were lower in the operated sides than in the normal sides (all p < 0.001). However, at 1 year postoperatively, the differences in pronation strength were not statistically significant (p = 0.188 for peak torque and p = 0.190 for total work), whilst supination torque and total work were still significantly lower in the operated sides (p = 0.015 and p = 0.029, respectively). Decreases in pronation strength were found to correlate significantly with decreases in supination strength and grip power. Wrist motion and DASH scores were not found to be correlated with decrease in pronation or supination strengths. Conclusions: In patients with a DRF treated by volar plating, pronation strength was not significantly different between the operated and normal sides at 1 year postoperatively, and decreases in pronation or supination strengths were not found to affect clinical outcomes as assessed by DASH scores. This study suggests that dissection of the PQ may have minimal clinical impact on forearm pronation function. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cuboid nutcracker fracture in children: Management and results	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Cuboid fractures; Nutcracker fracture; Children; Adolescents		Introduction: Compression fractures of the cuboid bone in children and adolescents are rare. Fracture morphology, associated lesions, treatment options and long-term outcomes of this very rare injury are published in a few case reports. This study with review of the literature aims to support the understanding of fracture pattern and optimize pathways of decision making. Material and Methods: A retrospective two-center study was performed in a patient cohort treated between 2001 and 2016. All patients aged less than 18 years who sustained a cuboid fracture were included. Age, gender, mechanism of injury, fracture morphology, amount of displacement, associated injuries, and therapy were analyzed. In the follow-up (FU), the AOFAS Midfoot Scale was investigated. Results: Fractures of the cuboid bone were diagnosed in 7 boys and 9 girls. The mean age of the patients was 10 years (range: 2.2-16.1 years). According to the classification of Fenton we detected 11 (69%) type 2, 2 (12%) type 3 and 3 (19%) type 5b fractures. Other fracture types according to Fenton were not observed. All children under 10 years sustained a type 2 fracture. Open reduction and internal fixation was performed in 5 (31%) patients. Bone grafting was not necessary. FU was performed in 14/16 patients on average after 9 years (mean; range: 1.4-16.2 years). The mean AOFAS Midfoot Scale at FU for extra-articular type 2 fractures was 100 points, whereas in intra-articular fractures (Type 3) and fractures associated with mid-tarsal disruption (type 5b) worse results were found (95 and 66 points, accordingly). Conclusion: This rare injury shows inhomogenous morphologies and offers different treatment approaches. Extra-articular Fenton type 2 lesions are the most common type of cuboid fracture in children (69%). A potential loss of length of the lateral column must be considered. In contrast to adults, type 1, 4, and 5a fractures were not found in our cohort of children and adolescents. Lower scores of the AOFAS Midfoot Scale were found with either intra-articular involvement or associated midfoot lesions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mixed methods process evaluation of an enhanced community-based rehabilitation intervention for elderly patients with hip fracture	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						process evaluation; feasibility study; hip fracture; proximal femoral fracture; rehabilitation medicine; self-efficacy	EFFICACY; SCALE	Objectives To describe the implementation of an enhanced rehabilitation programme for elderly hip fracture patients with mental capacity, in a randomised feasibility study compared with usual rehabilitation. To compare processes between the two and to collect the views of patients, carers and therapy staff about trial participation. Design Mixed methods process evaluation in a randomised feasibility study. Setting Patient participants were recruited on orthopaedic and rehabilitation wards; the intervention was delivered in the community following hospital discharge. Participants Sixty-one older adults (aged 65 years) recovering from surgical treatment (replacement arthroplasty or internal fixation) following hip fracture, who were living independently prior to fracture and had mental capacity and 31 of their carers. Interventions Usual care (control) or usual care plus an enhanced rehabilitation package (intervention). The enhanced rehabilitation consisted of a patient-held information workbook, goal-setting diary and up to six additional therapy sessions. Process evaluation components Recruitment of sites and rehabilitation teams, response of rehabilitation teams, recruitment and reach in patient and carer participants, intervention delivery, delivery to individuals, response of individual patients to the enhanced intervention or usual rehabilitation, response of carer participants, unintended consequences and testing intervention theory and context. Results Usual rehabilitation care was very variable. The enhanced rehabilitation group received a mean of five additional therapy sessions. All of the returned goal-setting diaries had inputs from the therapy team, and half had written comments by the patients and carers. Focus group themes: variation of usual care and its impact on delivering the intervention; the importance of goal setting; the role of the therapist in providing reassurance about safe physical activities; and acceptability of the extra therapy sessions. Conclusions Lessons learnt for a future definitive RCT include how to enhance recruitment and improve training materials, the workbook, delivery of the extra therapy sessions and recording of usual rehabilitation care.

Short term benefits of the BPs are well known. However, there are concerns regarding their long term use. The aim of the study was to analyze the association between atypical femoral fractures and BP misuse/abuse as well as study the outcome of management of these fractures. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study of a prospectively studied patients who presented with atypical femoral fractures between January 2010 and August 2012 and were followed up upto June 2014. The cohort consisted of nine female patients (12 fractures) with an average age of 71 years (range 58-85 years). Analysis was done for the indications, duration of BP use, configuration of associated fractures and method of treatment. Results: The mean duration of BP use was 6.6 years (range 4-10 years). BP treatment was initiated without sufficient indication and continued without proper review and followup in most cases. Most patients did not followup and continued to consume BPs without any review by the doctors. All patients had prodromal thigh pain of various duration, which was inadequately investigated and managed before the presentation. Two cases with an incomplete fracture and no thigh pain were managed successfully with conservative treatment. The rest were treated by surgery with intramedullary nailing. The average union time was longer and two fractures went into nonunion which required further surgical intervention. Conclusion: Atypical femoral fractures appear to be strongly related to abuse of BPs. Great care is to be exercised at initiation as well as the continuation of BP therapy, and regular review is required. There is a need for improved awareness among physicians about the possibility of such fractures, and interpretation of thigh pain and radiological findings, especially if the patient has been on BPs therapy. Internal fixation for complete fractures and for incomplete fractures with thigh pain is needed. Delayed union is common.

The aim of the study was to validate the functional outcomes of both stabilization techniques in the COVID-19 pandemic by comparing them with data obtained just before the pandemic, because the limitations of the COVID-19 pandemic are affecting several aspects of social and medical life-being afraid of the transmission of the infection, patients reduce their exposure to healthcare to absolutely essential emergencies. Moreover, working conditions in the operating theater have also become more restrictive. Materials and Methods: Investigations were performed on 112 adult patients with Neer's three- and four-fragment fractures stabilized with IMN (64) and ASP (48). Treatment effects were validated six months after surgery based on radiographs for evidence of bone union, humeral neck-shaft angle (NSA) and implant placement. Limb function was assessed with the QuickDash and Constant-Murley scores. Data obtained from patients treated in the COVID-19 pandemic were compared with those obtained before the pandemic. Results: The healing of all fractures was satisfactory, but complications developed in six cases. Three patients required secondary interventions due to inadequate repositioning: one after IMN and two after ASP. Additionally, one ASP was complicated by the secondary destabilization of a primarily properly stabilized major tubercle, and in two cases by conflict of the protruding implant with the acromion. ASP was noted to provide better functional results during the COVID-19 pandemic according to the Constant-Murley score (p = 0.0048; Student's t-test). No significant differences were observed in the pre-COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: Our results suggest that ASP is more beneficial for the stabilization of comminuted fractures of the proximal humerus during the COVID-19 pandemic.

There has been recent renewed interest in the isotope composition of carbohydrates, mainly for use in CO(2) flux partitioning studies at the ecosystem level. The major obstacle to the use of carbohydrates in such studies has been the lack of an acknowledged method to isolate starch and soluble sugars for isotopic measurements. We here report on the comparison and evaluation of existing methods (acid and enzymatic hydrolysis for starch; ion-exchange purification and compound-specific analysis for sugars). The selectivity and reproducibility of the methods were tested using three approaches: (i) an artificial leaf composed of a mixture of isotopically defined compounds, (ii) a C(4) leaf spiked with C(3) starch, and (iii) two natural plant samples (root, leaf). Starch preparation methods based on enzymatic or acid hydrolysis did not yield similar results and exhibited contaminations by non-starch compounds. The specificity of the acidic hydrolysis method was especially low, and we therefore suggest terming these preparations as HCl-hydrolysable carbon, rather than starch. Despite being more specific, enzyme-based methods to isolate starch also need to be further optimized to increase specificity. The analysis of sugars by ion-exchange methods (bulk preparations) was fast but produced more variable isotope compositions than compound-specific methods. Compound-specific approaches did not in all cases correctly reproduce the target values, mainly due to unsatisfactory separation of sugars and background contamination. Our study demonstrates that, despite their wide application, methods for the preparation of starch and soluble sugars for the analysis of carbon isotope composition are not (yet) reliable enough to be routinely applied and further research is urgently needed to resolve the identified problems.

Metaphyseal defects are common in osteoporotic bone and weaken the osteosynthesis construct. A novel technique for augmentation with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement was developed for the treatment of patients in advanced age with complex proximal humerus fractures and metaphyseal voids, whereby the cement was allowed to partially cure for 5-7 min after mixing to achieve medium viscosity, and then it was manually placed into the defect through the traumatic lateral window with a volume of 4-6 mL per patient. The aim of this retrospective clinical study was to assess this technique versus autologous bone graft augmentation and no augmentation. Materials and Methods: The outcomes of 120 patients with plated Neer three- and four-part fractures, assigned to groups of 63 cases with no augmentation, 28 with bone graft augmentation and 29 with cement augmentation, were assessed in this study. DASH, CS, pain scores and range of motion were analyzed at 3, 6 and 12 months. Statistical analysis was performed with factors for treatment and age groups, Neer fracture types and follow-up periods, and with the consideration of age as a covariate. Results: DASH and CS improved following cement augmentation at three and six months compared to bone grafting, being significant when correcting for age as a covariate (p <= 0.007). While the age group had a significant effect on both these scores with worsened values at a higher age for non-augmented and grafted patients (p <= 0.044), this was not the case for cement augmented patients (p >= 0.128). Cement augmentation demonstrated good clinical results at 12 months with a mean DASH of 10.21 and mean CS percentage of 84.83% versus the contralateral side, not being significantly different among the techniques (p >= 0.372), despite the cement augmented group representing the older population with more four-part fractures. There were no concerning adverse events specifically related to the novel technique. Conclusions: This study has detailed a novel technique for the treatment of metaphyseal defects with PMMA cement augmentation in elderly patients with complex proximal humerus fractures and follow-up to one year, whereby the cement was allowed to partially cure to achieve medium viscosity, and then it was manually placed into the defect through the traumatic lateral window. The results demonstrate clinically equivalent short-term results to 6 months compared to augmentation with bone graft or no augmentation-despite the patient group being older and with a higher rate of more severe fracture patterns. The technique appears to be safe with no specifically related adverse events and can be added in the surgeon's armamentarium for the treatment of these difficult to manage fractures.

An ethics approval of the study and appropriate consents were obtained for all patients before inclusion in our study. Materials and Methods: A total of 47 consecutive boys presented with impalpable testes in the ipsilateral hemiscrota, 3 of them were bilateral summing up to a total of 50 U of impalpable testes to a single center over 12 months (January-December 2014). Those boys underwent a preoperative ultrasound (US) Doppler scan for the ipsilateral and contralateral testes. They then proceeded to a first-stage laparoscopic exploration for the testes in which the cranial testicular artery and the caudal vas deferens were traced to their meeting point to locate the abdominal testes that were either found (peeping at the internal inguinal ring [IIR] or more cranially) or otherwise vanishing (intraabdominally blind-ending vas and vessels or extra-abdominally passing through the IIR). All 50 testes failed to stay at the contralateral IIR when brought there mandating a preliminary lengthening of the testicular vessels by lateral dissection, traction, and fixation to a point 1-2 cm superolateral to the contralateral anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), essentially a mobile traction point. After 12 weeks, all underwent a second-stage laparoscopic-assisted ipsilateral subdartos orchidopexy for the testes under traction. Occasional slippage of the testis under traction mandated an otherwise second-stage retraction and a third-stage orchidopexy. All underwent US Doppler scan 3 and 6 months after orchidopexy. Results: The 47 cryptorchid boys presented at a mean age of 3 years 2 months (range: 6 months-8 years). Out of the 50 impalpable testes, 9 were nonvisualized on preoperative US Doppler scan and 16 were vanishing on laparoscopic exploration: 5 abdominally (in utero vascular accident) and 11 scrotally (perinatal torsion). The remaining 34 testes were fixed loosely near the contralateral ASIS in the first-stage laparoscopic exploration. Out of which, 3 had slipped traction at the second stage. The 12-week traction interval went uneventfully and a predefinitive US Doppler scan confirmed viability of all testes under traction. All 34 elongated testes were mobilized and fixed in the ipsilateral hemiscrota inside a created subdartos pouch (of de Netto). All 34 fixed testes were confirmed viable on US Doppler scan 1, 3, and 6 months after orchidopexy. Conclusion: The novel Shehata technique of staged laparoscopic traction-lengthening for abdominal testes is safe, easy, and convenient as evidenced by our limited early experience. Neither internal herniation complicated the traction period nor testicular atrophy (by undue tension) complicated the traction or follow-up periods. We believe it is a good alternative to the Fowler-Stephens staged orchidopexy that entails risky division of the testicular vessels.	[Abouheba, Mohamed A.

We have designed a new implant (named acetabular fracture reduction internal fixator, AFRIF) for acetabular fractures involving the quadrilateral plate. This use of this new device was not investigated therefore we conducted a retrospective study aiming to determine whether the AFRIF can achieve satisfactory clinical and radiological outcomes for quadrilateral plate fracture. Hypothesis: The AFRIF for quadrilateral plate fracture is an acceptable option to treat acetabular fracture involving the quadrilateral plate. Materials and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on 24 patients (15 males and 9 females) with acute displaced quadrilateral plate fractures of the acetabulum who were treated by the AFRIF between August 2011 and May 2015. The mean age of the patients was 61.5 +/- 9.2 years (range, 31-82 years). All hips had protrusion of the femoral head, of these 5 hips with associated articular impaction of the medial roof. The type of fractures included anterior column in 4, anterior column + posterior hemitransverse in 3, associated both column in 11, T-shaped in 6 patients. The approaches included Limited Ilioinguinal (5 patients) and Limited Standard-Ilioinguinal combined with Kocher-Langenbeck (19 patients). Quality of reduction was evaluated and graded as anatomical (0 mm to 1 mm of displacement), imperfect (2 mm to 3 mm displacement) or poor (more than 3 mm displacement) according to the residual displacement as defined by Matta. The final follow-up clinical outcome was classified as excellent (18 points), good (15-17 points), fair (13-14 points) or poor (<13 points) in terms to the modified Merle d'Aubigne-Postel score, and radiological outcomes evaluation were as excellent, good, fair, or poor based on Matta score. Results: The mean duration of follow-up was 45.7 +/- 13.0 months (range, 24-60 months). Average operative time and bleeding amount was 110.3 +/- 30.8 min (range, 105-210 min) and 950.6 +/- 348.6 ml (range, 300-1500 ml), respectively. There was anatomical reduction in 17 patients (17/24, 70.8%), imperfect in 5 patients (5/24, 20.8%), and poor in 2 patients (2/24, 8.3%). All of the quadrilateral plate fractures achieved anatomical except one imperfect reduction. No re-protrusion of the femoral head was observed at the final follow-up. The mean modified Merle d'Aubigne-Postel score was 16.9 +/- 2.0 points (range, 10-18 points), and 83.3% (20 of 24) have good or excellent radiological outcomes. Discussion: The findings suggest that the AFRIF for quadrilateral plate fractures may prevent protrusion of the femoral head and achieve good to excellent clinical and radiological outcomes.

J	Lévêque, R; Sedel, L; Nizard, R; Bizot, P; Odri, GA				Leveque, Robin; Sedel, Laurent; Nizard, Remy; Bizot, Pascal; Odri, Guillaume-Anthony			Risk of simultaneous and delayed breakage of total hip replacement ceramic implants in patients with trauma induced periprosthetic fracture and acetabular shell loosening	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Ceramic bearings; Ceramic breakage; Total hip replacement; Periprosthetic fracture; Traumatic acetabular loosening	NATIONAL TRENDS; FEMORAL-HEAD; ARTHROPLASTY; BEARINGS	Background: Ceramic implant breakage (CIB) in total hip replacement (THR) is a rare incident. A confusion exists between the fragile mechanical behaviour of ceramic materials (brittleness) and fragility in the common sense (easy to break), leading to the misconception that trauma is to blame for these breakages. Trauma has been reported as a cause of breakage by several authors and it is debated whether the burst force can be reached in one single trauma in-vivo. We did a retrospective investigation aiming to determine the risk of CIB associated with a major trauma defined as a periprosthetic femoral fracture (PPFF) or a traumatic loosening of the acetabular shell (TLAS) in ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) THR. Hypothesis: The impact forces responsible of PPFF and TLAS, which are probably the most important impact forces sustained by patients, are not sufficient to induce immediate or delayed CIB.Material and methods: We conducted a retrospective study on 31 patients (62 ceramic implants, 31 acetabular liners and 31 femoral heads) with a PPFF or TLAS between January 2010 and January 2022. We reviewed the records and X-rays at the time of the major trauma and at the last follow-up. We searched for simultaneous CIB, and those occurring on the non-explanted ceramic implants at last follow up (delayed CIB). These major traumas occurred in 9 men and 22 women. Median age was 75 years old [20-97 years old]. There were 28 PPFF and 3 TLAS. Mean time from THR to trauma was 91.2 +/- 67 months [2.4-240 months].Results: On X-rays and after intraoperative confirmation, we do not report any simultaneous CIB on the 62 ceramic implants. Treatment consisted of internal fixation for 20 patients with preservation of both ceramic implants for Vancouver A, B1 and C fractures, 8 stem revisions with preservation of acetabular liner for Vancouver B2 and B3 fractures and 3 acetabular shell revisions to dual mobility and ceramic head change for TLAS. Thus, a total of 48 ceramic implants remained implanted (28 acetabular liners and 20 femoral heads). At last follow-up after the index revision (median = 36 months [6-100months]), no patient had a delayed CIB.Discussion: Major trauma resulting in a PPFF or TLAS in patient withs a CoC THR did not result in simul-taneous CIB. The impact forces during these traumas are not sufficient to induce immediate breakage of the ceramic implants. At a median 3 years follow-up we found no delayed CIB. Because CIB is a rare event, longer follow up and larger cohort study is needed to determine if a single high impact trauma can initiate and favour the spread of a crack in the ceramic material leading to a breakage. Considering the high mechanical resistance of the ceramic implants and the absence of CIB during or after a major trauma in our study, patients with CoC bearings should not be restricted in their daily activity to prevent CIB.

It occurs intraoperatively or in the early postoperative period, on cementless implants, and features a posteromedial cortical fragment around the lesser trochanter. The main aim of the present study was to report clinical and radiological results in a series of 33 cases of what is better called Vancouver B-lesser trochanter (VB-LT) fracture. The secondary objective was to identify risk factors. The study hypothesis was that VB-LT fracture might occur in the late postoperative course. Material and method: A2 single-center retrospective study included all patients with postoperative periprosthetic VB-LT fracture diagnosed on standard X-ray. Treatment was operative or non-operative depending on femoral implant subsidence and the patient's general health status. Results: There were 33 VB-LT fractures out of 445 periprosthetic femoral fractures (7.5%), in 27 women and 6 men; all were postoperative, at a mean 47 months (range, 1 day to 20 years). Mean subsidence of the femoral stem was 8.8 mm, in 73% of cases (24 out of 33 implants). The 9 VB-LT1 fractures (without subsidence) were treated non-operatively, without secondary displacement. Thirteen of the 24 VB-LT2 fractures (with subsidence) were managed by stem exchange and cerclage; 3 other patients had isolated stem exchange, 2 had isolated internal fixation by cerclage, and 6 in poor health were managed non-operatively. At a mean 28 months' follow-up (range, 6-48 months), mean PMA score was 15.5 (range, 10-18), Harris Hip score 72.4 (range, 43-100) and Parker score 7.2 (range, 4-9). All cases showed osseointegration and implant stability; there was 1 case of non-union, without impact on stability. Conclusion: Postoperative Vancouver B-lesser trochanter fracture seemed specific to cementless implants and did not occur exclusively in the early postoperative period. Non-operative treatment gave good results when there was no implant subsidence (type VB-LT1). (C) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

J	Rapp, JH; Hollenbeck, K; Pan, XM				Rapp, Joseph H.; Hollenbeck, Kelsy; Pan, Xian Mang			An experimental model of lacunar infarction: Embolization of microthrombi	JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	22nd Annual Meeting of the Western-Vascular-Society	SEP 08-11, 2007	Kona, HI	Western Vasc Soc			CEREBRAL WHITE-MATTER; EMBOLIC STROKE; RAT MODEL; ISCHEMIA; BRAIN; NEUROGENESIS; ARTERIES; PATTERN	Objectives: Microthrombi are undoubtedly the most common embolic material in the cerebral circulation, originating from even minor irregularities of the arterial wall, fibrillating atria, cardiac valves, and patent foramen ovale. Thrombus fragments are globular and likely to completely obstruct terminal vessels. In contrast, previous work with "atheroemboli" of needle-like cholesterol crystals rarely cause occlusions or infarctions instead creating small foci of inflammation. In this work, we asked if microthrombi would occlude terminal vessels land create lacunar type infarctions in the subcortical tissues of the rat brain where, as in human brain, collateral flow is limited relative to the cortex. Methods: Three treatment groups of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. All groups underwent general anesthesia with monitoring of temperature and blood pressure during cannulation of the right internal carotid artery. In the group embolized with thrombus fragments (n = 12), animals had injections of 300 fragments of thrombus size 60 to 100 microns, the cholesterol group (n = 6) had injections of 300 cholesterol crystals of similar size, and the control group (n = 4) had injections of saline. Brains were harvested at 4 days with perfusion fixation and were examined by immunohistochemical staining for breaks in the blood brain barrier (BBB) (albumin), microglial activation (CD11b), astrocyte activation (GFAP), and infarction (loss of NeuN staining). Size and location of the areas of injury and infarction were recorded. Results. Clot fragments caused discreet infarcts in 10/12 animals that were 0.1-1.7 mm in diameter and coincided with activation of microglia and astrocytes. In some areas, necrosis was already underway at this early time point. Consistent with our previous work, the infarcts caused by cholesterol crystals were smaller (P = .014). Foci of BBB disruption and microglial activation were distributed throughout the brain whereas areas of infarction were found almost exclusively in subcortical tissues (P = .029). Conclusions. Injecting microthrombi reproducibly caused areas of necrosis resembling lacunar type infarctions. These were primarily located in the striatum and thalamus presumably because these areas lack the branching, collateral network seen in the cortex. In addition, these data give further evidence that the extent of brain injury from emboli depends upon composition and shape as well as size.

The Treatment of the Proximal Humeral Fracture with the Use of the PHN Nailing System: the Importance of Reduction	ACTA CHIRURGIAE ORTHOPAEDICAE ET TRAUMATOLOGIAE CECHOSLOVACA			English	Article						humerus; fracture; PHN; intramedullary nailing; reduction	AXILLARY NERVE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; FIXATION	PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Intramedullary nailing is a minimally invasive technique that respects humeral head. However, limited surgical approach does not permit an anatomical reduction. The significance of the reduction on the functional outcome has not been sufficiently investigated. The aim of the study was to examine the functional and radiological postoperative outcome in patients with proximal humeral fractures treated with intramedullary nailing and the significance of reduction. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study population consisted of 43 patients with proximal humeral fractures that were treated with the Proximal Humerus Nail System (Targon, Aesculap). Mean follow-up period was 23.2 months (SD: 8.9). Shoulder function was assessed with the Constant-Murley Score. Reduction was examined radiographically anteroposterior and true lateral plane. Radiographs of 50 healthy shoulders served as controls. Malreduction was analyzed for 10 degrees, 15 degrees and 20 degrees in both planes. RESULTS The overall functional results were satisfying; mean CS of all patients at the last follow-up visit was 74.8 (SD: 19.3). Mean normalized CS for age and gender was 78.15 (SD 17.8). Fracture severity seemed to affect clinical outcome to a certain extent; 4-part fractures exhibited inferior results. Mean NSA was 126.5 (SD: 16.9) in anteroposterio and 137.4 (SD: 15.4) in true lateral view. The respective values in the control group were 134.1 degrees (SD 7.1 degrees) in anteroposterior and 133.7 degrees (SD 12.8 degrees) in true lateral view. A malreduction of >20 degrees in the anteroposterior plane and >15 degrees in both anteroposterior and true lateral planes resulted in significantly inferior clinical outcome. Thirteen complications were recorded, four of them being major. DISCUSSION The quality of reduction affected the postoperative outcome to a certain extent. Especially the anteroposterior reduction seemed to play a more important role in the postoperative function than reduction in the true lateral plane. However, this difference was statistically significant only after > 20 degrees malreduction. The-worst results in Constant Score were shown, as expected, in the group with malreduction in both planes; even a 15 degrees malreduction resulted in statistically significant difference. The importance of anteroposterior reduction could be due to achievement of better ROM in the frontal plane, most probably because of better levers on the tuberosities. However an absolute anatomical reduction does not have to be achieved at all costs. The overall good results of the fractures in this study despite absence of anatomical reduction could partly result from the limited surgical approach. CONCLUSIONS The majority of the patients treated with closed reduction and internal fixation with PHN show good postoperative functional results. However, fracture malreduction reduction cannot be always avoided with the use of PHN. Nevertheless, the evaluation of the Constant-Murley score shows an absolute anatomical reduction in not necessary for satisfying functional outcome. The reduction in anteroposterior plane seems to play a more important role in the postsurgical functional outcome. A malreduction that exceeds 15 degrees in both planes or a malreduction of more than 20 degrees in either plane should be avoided.

J	Kumar, S; Mahanta, S				Kumar, Suresh; Mahanta, Sunayan			Primary total elbow arthroplasty	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Ankylosis; comminuted fracture of distal humerus; total elbow arthroplasty	RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; ENDOPROSTHETIC REPLACEMENT; INTERNAL-FIXATION; DISTAL PART; BIOMECHANICS; FRACTURES; NONUNIONS; ANKYLOSIS; HUMERUS; MOTION	Background: Primary total elbow arthroplasty (TEA) is a challenging procedure for orthopedic surgeons. It is not performed as frequently as compared to hip or knee arthroplasty. The elbow is a nonweight-bearing joint; however, static loading can create forces up to three times the body weight and dynamic loading up to six times. For elderly patients with deformity and ankylosis of the elbow due to posttraumatic arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis or comminuted fracture distal humerus, arthroplasty is one of the option. The aim of this study is to analyze the role of primary total elbow arthroplasty in cases of crippling deformity of elbow. Materials and Methods: We analyzed 11 cases of TEA, between December 2002 and September 2012. There were 8 females and 3 males. The average age was 40 years (range 30-69 years). The indications for TEA were rheumatoid arthritis, comminuted fracture distal humerus with intraarticular extension, and posttraumatic bony ankylosis of elbow joint. The Baksi sloppy (semi constrained) hinge elbow prosthesis was used. Clinico-radiological followup was done at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and then yearly basis. Results: In the present study, average supination was 70 degrees (range 60-80 degrees) and average pronation was 70 degrees (range 60-80 degrees). Average flexion was 135 degrees (range 130-135 degrees). However, in 5 cases, there was loss of 15 to 35 degrees (average 25 degrees) of extension (45 degrees) out of 11 cases. The mean Mayo elbow performance score was 95.4 points (range 70-100). Arm length discrepancy was only in four patients which was 36% out of 11 cases. Clinico-radiologically all the elbows were stable except in one case and no immediate postoperative complication was noted. Radiolucency or loosening of ulnar stem was seen in 2 cases (18%) out of 11 cases, in 1 case it was noted after 5 years and in another after 10 years. In second case, revision arthroplasty was done, in which only ulnar hinge section, hinge screw and lock screw with hexagonal head were replaced. Conclusion: Elbow arthroplasty remains a valuable option for deformed and ankylosed elbows especially in the demanding patients with crippling deformity of the elbow.

Percutaneous hallux valgus surgery in children: Short-term outcomes of 33 cases	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Hallux valgus; Children; Adolescent; Minimally invasive foot surgery; Skeletally immature	METATARSAL ARTICULAR ANGLE; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; LONG-TERM; RELIABILITY; ADOLESCENTS; OSTEOTOMY	Background: Many surgical procedures for hallux valgus correction have been reported, including percutaneous techniques. In children, the risk of recurrent hallux valgus after any type of surgical correction seems to deserve attention. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the outcomes of percutaneous hallux valgus surgery in children. Here, we report a study on this topic. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed 33 percutaneous surgical procedures to correct idiopathic hallux valgus in 18 children younger than 16 years of age. Radiographs obtained pre-operatively and at last follow-up were used to determine the hallux valgus angle (HVA), intermetatarsal angle (IMA), and distal metatarsal articular angle (DMAA). Clinical outcomes were assessed using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score and a satisfaction score. Results: Mean follow-up was 30 months. At surgery, mean age was 12.5 years and the growth plates were open in 20/33 (61%) cases. Mean HVA correction was 8.6. (from 28.06 degrees to 19.45 degrees, P < 0.01) and mean DMAA correction was 7 degrees (from 15.97 degrees to 8.97 degrees, P < 0.01). At last follow-up, 20 (61%) feet had HVA values greater than 16 degrees, but in half these cases the patients reported being satisfied with the procedure, leaving 30% of feet with symptomatic under-correction. Mean post-operative AOFAS score was 80.7. Patients were satisfied or very satisfied for 24/33 (73%) feet. Discussion: We found a high-rate of radiographic under-correction. Studies of factors associated with recurrent hallux valgus would be expected to result in technical improvements and therefore in better outcomes. Conclusion: Our evaluation of short-term outcomes after percutaneous hallux valgus surgery without internal fixation showed both a high-rate of under-correction and a high-rate of patient satisfaction. Medium-term studies are needed to determine whether these results are sustained over time. The available data suggest a number of technical improvements. At present, we plan to continue to offer this procedure to children and their families. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Materials and methods: Samples from 24 adult autopsy subjects were obtained from the thoracolumbar spine spinous process and lamina space at levels T1 through L5. Direct measurements were made for the spinous process spacing distance, spinous process length, width, thickness and inclination angle, and the lamina space width and height. Results: 1. Distance of the spine spinous process spacing: Thoracic part: The maximum tip distance was observed at T4 similar to T5 level, and the minimum tip distance was observed at T9 similar to T10 level. The maximum centre distance and root distance were observed at T11 similar to T12 level, and the minimum were observed at T5 similar to T6 level separately. Lumbar part: distance of spinous process spacing in lumbar part showed a decreasing pattern from L1 similar to L2 to L5 similar to S1. 2. Length, width, thickness of the spine spinous process: 1) The length of the spinous process: The upper border gradually increased from T1 to T6 and then decreased till T12 region. The centre region is T8 maximum, T11 minimum. The lower border length showed a decreasing trend from T1 to T12. Lumbar part: The length increased from L1 and reached maximum value at L3. Then, the length decreased gradually to reach minimum value at L5. 2) The width of the spinous process: The width showed an increasing trend from T1 to T12. Lumbar part: Maximum width was seen at L3 and a minimum L5. 3) The thickness of the spinous process: Tip thickness > Centre thickness > Root thickness in each thoracic and lumbar vertebra. Thoracic part: the maximum tip thickness is T1, T7 minimum, The maximum centre thickness is T12, T7 minimum. The maximum root height is T6, T9 minimum. Lumbar part: Maximum tip thickness was seen at L1, and a minimum L3. Maximum centre thickness was seen at L5, and a minimum L2. Maximum root thickness was seen at L2, and a minimum L1. 3. Inclination angle of the spine spinous process: The inclination angle gradually decreased from T1 to T7 to minimum value at T7 and then increased till T12 region. 4. Width and height of lamina space: 1) The width of lamina space: For thoracic part, the data became shorter gradually from T1 similar to T2 to T5 similar to T6, and then increased till to T11 similar to T12. For lumbar part, the width of lamina space increased from T12 similar to L1 to L5 similar to S1. 2) The height of lamina space: In the thoracic vertebrae, the maximum height of centre region was observed at T11 similar to T12 and the minimum mean value was observed at T3 similar to T4. In the lumbar vertebrae, the height of the lamina space was gradually increased from T12 similar to L1 to L5 similar to S1. Conclusions: This study reports morphometric data of the thoracolumbar spine spinous process and lamina space in the Chinese population, which provides an anatomic basis for thoracolumbar spine design of internal fixation, posterior surgery, puncture and epidural anaesthesia.

Complex fractures of the acetabulum: Should the enlarged iliofemoral approach be abandoned? Results at 20 years' follow-up	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Acetabulum; Fracture; Iliofemoral; Surgery; Treatment	HIP; ANTERIOR; CLASSIFICATION; ARTHROPLASTY; ARTHRITIS; OUTCOMES	Introduction: Among the various options for internal fixation of acetabular fractures, the enlarged iliofemoral approach is less often used, being more invasive, although providing greater exposure enabling control of all components in complex fractures. Even so, the impact of its invasiveness has not been confirmed, and long-term results are not known. We therefore performed a retrospective study, aiming: to assess long-term functional outcome, and; to assess associated morbidity. Hypothesis: The enlarged iliofemoral approach allows precise reduction, with favorable long-term outcome. Material and methods: Between 1992 and 1997, 15 patients were operated on for complex acetabular fracture by a single surgeon using an enlarged iliofemoral approach. Two patients were excluded due to lack of follow-up data, leaving 13 patients for analysis: 3 simple transverse fractures, 4 transverse + posterior wall fractures, 4 anterior column + posterior hemi-transverse fractures, one T-shaped fracture and one 2-column fracture. There were 4 cases of posterior dislocation of the hip, and 8 of intrapelvic protrusion. Surgical morbidity was assessed in terms of operative time, number of packed red blood cell transfusions, iatrogenic lesions or postoperative complications, rehabilitation time, and hospital stay. Functional assessment at follow-up used the WOMAC index and Harris score; radiologic assessment used the Kellgren-Lawrence score for osteoarthritis and Brooker score for ossification. Results: Reduction was in all cases anatomic. There were no intra- or post-operative complications. Median number of packed red blood cell transfusions was 5 [range, 3-10]. Median operative time was 4 hours [3-6]. Median hospital stay was 6 weeks [6-8], to allow systematic traction with early postoperative mobilization. Weight-bearing was resumed at a median 8 weeks [8-12]. At a median 22 years' follow-up [20-24], median Harris score was 83.5 [63-92] and median WOMAC index 24.5 [1-52]. All patients showed Brooker 1 or 2 ectopic ossification and moderate osteoarthritis. Two underwent subsequent arthroplasty (at 1 and 11 years after the index procedure). Discussion: The enlarged iliofemoral approach allowed anatomic reduction of acetabular fracture. It provided very good long-term results, without excessive morbidity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Material/Methods: A total of 69 obese patients with LDH (35 males and 34 females; age range, 24 to 43 years; median age, 34 years) were included in this study. These patients had undergone TED from March 2011 to December 2015 in the Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University. Their clinical and follow-up data were prospectively analyzed. The degree of pain and disability were measured on the basis of the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at 1 day before surgery, immediately after surgery, and 3 months after surgery. Neurologic functions were measured on the basis of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) system 1 day before surgery and 3 months after surgery. The MacNab score at last follow-up was recorded to evaluate the early clinical efficacy. Complications during and after the operation were recorded to evaluate the safety of surgery. Results: Two patients experienced abnormal sensations in the export nerve root zone postoperatively, which disappeared after 3 days of treatment with dehydration and administration of hormone (dexamethasone). Three cases of recurrence were observed at 6 months, 7 months, and 9 months postoperatively; they were scheduled to receive total laminectomy combined with bone grafting internal fixation. A total of 67 patients were followed up for 3-23 months and mean follow-up was 11.8 months. The VAS scores at postoperative 3 months and 1 year were significantly reduced compared to that before the operation, with significant differences between them (t=43.072, P<0.05; t=43.139, P<0.05). The JOA scores at last follow-up postoperatively was significantly higher than that before surgery (t=-60.312, P<0.05). At the last follow-up, 17 cases (25.3%) had excellent outcomes, 39 (58.2%) good, 7 (10.4%) fair, and 4 (5.9%) poor. Overall, 83.5% of patients had excellent or good rates. Conclusions: The early efficacy of TED is relatively good and safe for the selected obese patients with LDH in this study.

A musculoskeletal model of the equine forelimb for determining surface stresses and strains in the humerus - Part I. Mathematical modeling	JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article							BONE STRAIN; MUSCLE; FRACTURES; TENSION; TENDON; INVIVO; TIBIA	Knowledge of the forces that act upon the equine humerus while the horse is standing and the resulting strains experienced by the bone is useful for the prevention and treatment of fractures and for assessing the proximolateral aspect of the bone as a site for obtaining autogenous bone graft material. The first objective was to develop a mathematical model to predict the loads on the proximal half of the humerus created by the surrounding musculature and ground reaction forces while the horse is standing. The second objective was to calculate surface bone stresses and strains at three cross sections on the humerus corresponding to the donor site for bone grafts, a site predisposed to stress fracture, and the middle of the diaphysis. A three-dimensional mathematical model employing optimization techniques and asymmetrical beam analysis was used to calculate shoulder muscle forces and surface strains on the proximal and mid-diaphyseal aspects of the humerus. The active shoulder muscles, which included the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, and short head of the deltoid, produced small forces while the horse is standing; all of which were limited to 4.3% of their corresponding maximum voluntary contraction. As a result, the strains calculated at the proximal cross sections of the humerus were small, with maximum compressive strains of -104 mu epsilon at the cranial aspect of the bone graft donor cross section. The middle of the diaphysis experienced larger strain magnitudes with compressive strains at the lateral and the caudal aspects and tensile strains at the medial and cranial aspects (-377 mu epsilon and 258 mu epsilon maximum values, respectively) while the horse is standing. Small strains at the donor bone graft site do not rule out using this location to harvest bone graft tissue, although strains while rising to a standing position during recovery from anesthesia are unknown. At the site common to stress fractures, small strains imply that the stresses seen by this region while the horse is standing, although applied for long periods of time, are not a cause of fracture in this location. Knowing the specific regions of the middle of the diaphysis of the humerus that experience tensile and compressive strains is valuable in determining optimum placement of internal fixation devices for the treatment of complete fractures.

The purpose of this study was to compare resuscitative mean arterial pressures (MAPs), intravenous fluid (IVF) administra-tion, and mortality rates between intertrochanteric (IT) and femoral neck (FN) fracture patients.Hypothesis: We hypothesized that IT fracture patients would receive less aggressive fluid resuscita-tion than FNF patients given the perceived less invasive nature of intra-medullary nails compared with hemiarthroplasty.Materials and methods: An institutional database was queried to identify all hip fractures managed surgi-cally over a 2-year period. Preoperative and intraoperative MAPs and IVF administration, as measures of resuscitation, were compared between IT fracture patients treated with open reduction internal fixation and FN fracture patients treated with hemiarthroplasty.Results: Six hundred and ninety-eight hip fractures, including 531 IT and 167 FN fractures, were analyzed. There were no differences between IT and FN fracture cohorts for age, sex distribution, or Charlson Comor-bidity Index scores. IT fracture patients were found to have lower MAP upon admission (103.7 +/- 20.1 vs. 107.8 +/- 18.4 mmHg; p = 0.026), and lower average, minimum, and maximum MAP values preoperatively and intraoperatively. Despite lower MAPs, IT fracture patients received less total IVF (581.9 +/- 472.5 vs. 832.9 +/- 496.5cc; p < 0.001) and lower IVF rates intraoperatively (306.5 +/- 256.8 vs. 409.8 +/- 251.0 cc/h; p < 0.001). IT fracture patients experienced higher 30-day (7.9% vs. 3.6%; p = 0.040) and 90-day (10.6% vs. 5.4%; p = 0.035) mortality rates and trended towards higher inpatient mortality (3.0% vs. 0.6%; p = 0.088). Multivariate regression demonstrated IT pattern to be independently predictive of 30-day mortality with 2.459 increased odds relative to FN fracture (p = 0.039).Discussion: IT fracture patterns are associated with decreased perioperative MAP values, yet received lower perioperative IVF rates. IT fracture patients suffered higher 30-and 90-day mortality rates, despite similar age and comorbidities. Level of evidence: III; retrospective cohort study.(c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Materials and Methods: Using 200 porcine mandibles, 3 different monocortical plating techniques were evaluated. The condyles were fractured along a defined line tangentially through the sigmoid notch and perpendicular to the posterior border. After anatomic reduction, osteosynthesis was performed using either standard rhombic 3D condylar fracture plates and standard screws (group A) or locking rhombic 3D condylar fracture plates, which were fixed either with standard screws (group B) or locking screws (group C). For comparison, nonfractured condyles (group D) and condyles fixed with standard two 4-hole miniplates and 8 screws (group E) were included. Using a universal mechanical testing machine (TIRA Test 2720; TIRA GmbH Schalkau, Germany), each group was subjected to linear loading from laterally to medially, medially to laterally, anteriorly to posteriorly, and posteriorly to anteriorly. The maximum axial force and displacement at the maximum force were measured. The mean values were compared for statistical significance using analysis of variance with Bonferroni's correction (statistical significance set at P < .05). Results: The main mode of failure in the plating techniques investigated was the pull out of screws from the proximal fragment. We found no statistically significant differences in the stability of osteosynthesis between the two 4-hole miniplates and the rhombic 3D condylar fracture plate when loading from posteriorly to anteriorly, laterally to medially, and medially to laterally. However, when loading from anteriorly to posteriorly, a statistically significant difference between the standard and locking system and the two 4hole miniplate system was observed, with the latter proving more stable. Conclusions: The results of the present biomechanical study suggest that the rhombic 3D condylar frac- ture plates are suitable for the treatment of condylar neck fractures. Both types of the plate are able to resist physiologic strains comparable to the two 4-hole miniplates.

To define underlying pathophysiologic processes, we used animal models including a rat model of metabolic syndrome generated by breeding for a trait of low aerobic exercise tolerance. After 35 generations, the low capacity runner (LCR) rats differ 10-fold in their aerobic exercise capacity from high capacity runner (HCR) rats. The LCR rats respond to surgical procedure with an abnormal phenotype consisting of exaggerated and persistent PCD and failure to resolve neuroinflammation. We determined whether preoperative exercise can rectify the abnormal surgical phenotype. Materials and methods: Following institutional approval of the protocol each of male LCR and male HCR rats were randomly assigned to four groups and subjected to isoflurane anesthesia and tibia fracture with internal fixation (surgery) or anesthesia alone (sham surgery) and to a preoperative exercise regimen that involved walking for 10 km on a treadmill over 6 weeks (exercise) or being placed on a stationary treadmill (no exercise). Feces were collected before and after exercise for assessment of gut microbiome. Three days following surgery or sham surgery the rats were tested for ability to recall a contextual aversive stimulus in a trace fear conditioning paradigm. Thereafter some rats were euthanized and the hippocampus harvested for analysis of inflammatory mediators. At 3 months, the remainder of the rats were tested for memory recall by the probe test in a Morris Water Maze. Results: Postoperatively, LCR rats exhibited exaggerated cognitive decline both at 3 days and at 3 months that was prevented by preoperative exercise. Similarly, LCR rats had excessive postoperative neuroinflammation that was normalized by preoperative exercise. Diversity of the gut microbiome in the LCR rats improved after exercise. Discussion: Preoperative exercise eliminated the metabolic syndrome risk for the abnormal surgical phenotype and was associated with a more diverse gut microbiome. Prehabilitation with exercise should be considered as a possible intervention to prevent exaggerated and persistent PCD in high-risk settings.

Materials and Methods: A total of 129 patients (164 TMJs) with ICF were treated from June 2004 to May 2009. Osteosynthesis was performed by different methods without stripping the lateral pterygoid muscle (LPM). The disc was reduced with or without transecting adhesions, release of the epimysium of the LPM, and anchorage to the condyle. Retrodiscal tissue tear was repaired. The patients were evaluated by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and clinical signs pre- and postoperatively. Results: Inferomedial displacement of the condylar segment and disc occurred in 97.6% of cases. Adhesion of the superior joint space was found in 37 of 160 TMJs (23.1%). Retrodiscal tissue tear combined with disc displacement was found in 119 of 160 TMJs (74.4%). The condylar stump was found to be superolaterally displaced in 30.6% (49/160) and laterally dislocated out of the fossa in 41.9% (69/160). A lateral capsular tear was observed in 87 of 160 TMJs (54.4%). The condylar fragments and the discs were reduced and fixed completely with preservation of the attachment of the LPM. Coronal CT revealed that 95.6% (130/160 cases) of ICFs were correctly reduced and fixed. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging showed that the disc was reduced to its normal position in 40 of 42 TMJs. Long-term complications of 45 patients included fibrous ankylosis in 1 case (0.8%), mouth opening limitation (<2.5 cm) in 5 cases, (3.9%), condyle resorption in 3 cases (2.3%) that needed plate removal, facial nerve injury in 3 cases (2.3%), TMJ click in 2 cases (1.6%), mouth open with deviation in 7 cases (5.4%), and malocclusion in 1 case (0.8%). Conclusion: Anatomic reduction of soft tissue was of benefit for biomechanical function of the TMJ and decreased the complications of open surgery.

The presentation may vary, from asymptomatic patients, who should be observed in most of the cases, to patients with acute episode of broken rods, and or chronic pain with often trunk imbalance. In some instances, patients will present with neurologic symptoms. The evaluation of such patients must start with a good understanding of why the surgery failed first place. Poor host, smoking, lack of anterior column support, poor sagittal balance, lack of fusion, poor construct. Often a combination of all of the above is encountered. The workup for such cases consists of imaging studies (with often a CT myelogram as the excessive metal artifact will render the MRI imaging useless), nutrition labs, DEXA scan, EOS films and internal medicine or cardiology consult for risk stratification as this may represent major surgery. Indication of surgery is mostly based on pain and imbalance and/or poor function. The surgeon planning a revision adult deformity surgery has many tasks to perform: Identify and avoid the reasons that lead to failure of the previous surgeries. Plan the anterior column reconstruction either through posterior or anterior interbody fusion. Restore the global alignment through anterior or posterior osteotomies to achieve sagittal and coronal balance. Obtain a solid fixation with sufficient levels above and below the osteotomies sites with in some cases the use of pelvic screws and four rods (Quad-Rod) techniques. The use of bone graft (either autologous, allograft, bone graft enhancers and inducer) agents. The requirement of decompression either through a virgin spine or a previous laminectomy bed. Despite the extent of these surgeries and the potential for immediate postoperative complications, the outcome is in most cases satisfactory if these goals are achieved. In this review, the authors explore different scenarios for pseudoarthrosis in the adult spine deformity patient and the preferred treatment method to obtain the best outcome for every individual patient.

In a previous study by the senior author (Nathan et al, 2005), life expectancy in patients operated on for bone metastases correlated with clinical and haematological parameters in a normogram. We performed a cross-cultural comparison to validate this normogram. Materials and Methods: We randomly selected 73 patients who had undergone surgery for metastatic bone disease between 28 December 2000 and 11 March 2009. The time to deaths was recorded from hospital records and telephone interviews. Multiple parameters including clinical, radiological and haematological were evaluated for significant prognostic value using Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis. Statistically significant parameters were entered into a Cox regression model for statistically independent significance. A multi-tier prediction of survival was performed by workers from various levels of seniority. Results: At the time of analysis, there were 40 deaths (55%). Median survival was 15.8 (95% Cl, 7.9 to 23.7) months. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that low haemoglobin (P = 0.0000005), presence of lymph node metastases (P = 0.00008), multiple bone metastases (P = 0.003), presence of visceral metastases, (P = 0.007), low lymphocyte count (P = 0.02) and low serum albumin (P = 0.02) were significantly associated with poor survival. By Cox regression analysis, presence of visceral metastases (P = 0.002), presence of lymph node metastases (P = 0.0002) and low haemoglobin (P = 0.01) were shown to be independent factors in the prediction of survival. Survivorship readings were superimposed onto the previous normogram and found to be similar. Independent blinded use of the normogram allowed good prediction of survival. There was a tendency to underestimate survival when patients survived beyond 1 year of skeletal metastasis. Conclusion: Our findings are similar to that of the previous study in showing a relationship between the above-mentioned parameters and survival. This is despite differences in patient demographic characteristics and management protocols. Use of the tools may allow better siting of most appropriate surgery in metastatic bony disease.

Addition of 0.5 wt % Ce to forged MZS alloys leads to strengthening of the basal texture as well as formation of a higher fraction of dynamic recrystallized (DRX) grains. Hot forging and addition of cerium to the MZS alloy improve both the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of the forged MZS-Ce alloy by 1.39 and 1.21 times, respectively, compared to those of the forged MZS alloy. The potentiodynamic polarization test in Hank's solution indicates that the corrosion resistance of the forged MZS alloy improves with addition of 0.5 wt % Ce. Uniform distribution of Mg12Ce precipitates, a higher DRX fraction, strengthened texture, and formation of a compact CeO2 passive layer result in 1.68 times reduction in the immersion corrosion rate of the forged MZS-Ce alloy compared to that of the forged MZS alloy. Addition of Ce to the MZS alloy shows excellent antibacterial activity. The forged MZS-Ce alloy exhibited the highest antibacterial efficacy (76.73%). All the alloys show favorable cytocompatibility and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity with MC3T3-E1 cells. The improved corrosion resistance of the forged MZS-Ce alloy (95%) leads to higher cell viability compared to that of the forged MZS alloy (85%). In vivo biodegradation and the ability to generate new bones were analyzed by implanting cylindrical samples in the rabbit femur. Histological analysis showed no adverse effects around the implants. Gradual degradation of the implants and higher new bone formation around the forged MZS-Ce sample were confirmed by micro-CT analysis. Bone regeneration around the implants (58.21%) was validated by flurochrome labeling. After 60 days, the forged MZS-Ce alloy showed controlled corrosion and better bone-implant integration, presenting it as a potential candidate for internal fracture fixation materials.

MiR-214-3p delays fracture healing in rats with osteoporotic fracture through inhibiting BMP/Smad signaling pathway	EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						MiR-214-3-p; BMP/Smad signaling pathway; Osteoporotic fracture healing	ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; OSTEOBLAST DIFFERENTIATION; MICRORNAS; BIOGENESIS; TARGETS; RNAS	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the mechanism of micro-ribonucleic acid (miR)-214-3p in regulating fracture healing in rats with osteoporosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 30 female Sprague-Dawley rats were selected and randomly divided into 3 groups. including group A [phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). n=10], group B (AntagomiR-NC, n=10), and group C (AntagomiR-214-3p, n=10). All rats underwent ovariectomy, and the osteoporosis rat model was verified by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 8 weeks after the operation. Then the osteoporotic fracture was established in rats via a second operation. From the successful modeling until the 6th week, 50 mu L PBS (2 nmoL) was intraperitoneally injected in group A, an equal amount of AntagomiR-NC was injected in group B, and an equal amount of AntagomiR-214-3p was injected in group C once a week. At the 6th week, fracture healing of osteoporosis rats was evaluated. At the same time, the expression of miR-214-3p in the three groups was detected via reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Furthermore. the protein expressions of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and Smad4 in the three groups were detected via Western blotting (WB). RESULTS: After ovariectomy, the bone mineral density in each group was significantly lower than that before ovariectomy. and the differences were statistically significant (p<0.05). Imaging evaluation demonstrated that compared with group A and B, there were significantly more callus tissues in group C. Meanwhile, the fracture line healing was better and blurred, and the internal fixation had no displacement and loosening. RT-PCR results indicated that the expression level of miR-214-3p in group C was significantly lower than that of the other two groups (p<0.05). WB results showed that the protein expression levels of BMP2 and Smad4 in group C were significantly higher than those of group A and group B (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MiR-214-3p delays fracture healing in rats with osteoporotic fracture by inhibiting the BMP/Smad signaling pathway.

Implant loosening and toxic complications are significant and recognized problems. Here we devised two strategies to improve PMMA-based bone cement: (1) adding 4-methacryloyloxylethyl trimellitate anhydride (4-META) to MMA monomer to render it hydrophilic; and (2) using tri-n-butyl borane (TBB) as a polymerization initiator instead of benzoyl peroxide (BPO) to reduce free radical production. Rat bone marrow-derived osteoblasts were cultured on PMMA-BPO, common bone cement ingredients, and 4-META/MMA-TBB, newly formulated ingredients. After 24 h of incubation, more cells survived on 4-META/MMA-TBB than on PMMA-BPO. The mineralized area was 20-times greater on 4-META/MMA-TBB than PMMA-BPO at the later culture stage and was accompanied by upregulated osteogenic gene expression. The strength of bone-to-cement integration in rat femurs was 4- and 7-times greater for 4-META/MMA-TBB than PMMA-BPO during early- and late-stage healing, respectively. MicroCT and histomorphometric analyses revealed contact osteogenesis exclusively around 4-META/MMA-TBB, with minimal soft tissue interposition. Hydrophilicity of 4-META/MMA-TBB was sustained for 24 h, particularly under wet conditions, whereas PMMA-BPO was hydrophobic immediately after mixing and was unaffected by time or condition. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy revealed that the free radical production for 4-META/MMA-TBB was 1/10 to 1/20 that of PMMA-BPO within 24 h, and the substantial difference persisted for at least 10 days. The compromised ability of PMMA-BPO in recruiting cells was substantially alleviated by adding free radical-scavenging amino-acid N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) into the material, whereas adding NAC did not affect the ability of 4-META/MMA-TBB. These results suggest that 4-META/MMA-TBB shows significantly reduced cytotoxicity compared to PMMA-BPO and induces osteoconductivity due to uniquely created hydrophilic and radical-free interface. Further pre-clinical and clinical validations are warranted.

MiR-21 promotes fracture healing by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway	EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						MiR-21; PI3K/Akt signaling pathway; Fracture healing		OBJECTIVE: This study aims to elucidate the potential mechanism of micro ribonucleic acid (miR)-21 in promoting fracture healing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into group A (phosphate-buffered saline, PBS, n=10), group B (AntagomiR-21, n=10) and group C (AntagomiR-NC, n=10) according to the different treatments. The femoral fracture operation was performed in every rat, which was pathologically diagnosed via X-ray. After the successful modeling, 50 mu L (2 nmoL) PBS, 50 mu L AntagomiR-21 or 50 mu L AntagomiR-NC was intraperitoneally injected into rats in group A, B or C, respectively. The above agents were injected once a week for 6 weeks. At 6 weeks, 3 rats were executed in each group, and the tissue at the fracture end was observed via hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The fracture healing of rats was evaluated via imaging at 1 and 7 weeks. At the same time, the expression of miR-21 in the three groups was detected via Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), and the expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-hydroxy kinase (PI3K) and phosphorylated-serine/threonine-protein kinase B (p-Akt) in the three groups was detected via Western blotting. RESULTS: According to the histological staining, the bone repair at the fracture end of rats in group B was not significant with fracture and poor continuity compared with those in group A and group C. The imaging evaluation revealed that in group B, the callus tissues were significantly reduced, the fracture line had undesirable healing. There were no displacement and loosening of internal fixation compared with group A and group C. Besides, RT-PCR showed that the miR-21 expression declined markedly in group B compared with that in group A and group C, and the differences were statistically significant (p<0.05). Western blotting manifested that the protein levels of PI3K and p-Akt also declined in group B compared with those in group A and group C, and there were statistically significant differences (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MiR-21 promotes the fracture healing in fractured rats by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

Material and methods: From April 2014 to October 2018, one hundred and eighty patients were included. We divided the patients into four groups. Intraoperative AP and lateral views were taken and sizes of the screws were chosen based on actual measurement (Group A, 45 patients). AP, lateral and tangential views were taken and sizes of the screws were also chosen based on actual measurement (Group B, 45 patients). Intraoperative AP and lateral views were taken and the selected screws were 2 mm shorter than actual measurement (Group C, 45 patients). AP, lateral and tangential views were taken and the selected screws were 2 mm shorter than actual measurement (Group D, 45 patients). Prominent screws were changed intraoperatively according to each view. A computed tomography (CT) was taken postoperatively to identify residual prominent screws. Results: The number of dorsally prominent screws exceeding 1 mm was 6 of 301 in Group A (2.0%), 15 of 290 (5.2%) in Group B, 2 of 289 in Group C (0.7%), and 2 of 282 (0.7%) in Group D. All these prominent screws (25 screws) were exchanged for shorter screws during surgery. Group A and Group B had significant difference in detecting intraoperative dorsal screw penetration (p < 0.05). Group C and Group D had no significant difference in detecting intraoperative dorsal screw penetration (p > 0.05). Postoperative CT identified 12 additional prominent screws with >= 1 mm dorsal penetration in Group A, 2 screws in Group B, 1 screw in Group C and 0 screw in Group B respectively. Significant difference was found between Group A and Group B of CT results (p < 0.05) while no statistical difference was found between Group C and Group D of CT results (p > 0.05). Discussions: Tangential view helped identify screw penetration. If tangential view was not available intraoperatively, screw penetration could also be avoided by downsizing the distal locking screw by 2 mm shorter than actual measurement.

Differential gene expression controlled by internal and external cues is a major driver of growth and time specific differentiation in plants. Transcriptome analysis is the state-of-the-art method to detect spatio-temporal changes in gene expression during development. Monitoring changes in gene expression at early stages or in small plant organs and tissues requires an accurate technique of tissue isolation, which subsequently results in RNA of sufficient quality and quantity. Laser-microdissection enables such accurate dissection and collection of desired tissue from sectioned material at a microscopic level for RNA extraction and subsequent downstream analyses, such as transcriptome, proteome, genome or miRNA. Results: A protocol for laser-microdissection, RNA extraction and RNA-seq was optimized and verified for three distant angiosperm species: Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae), Oryza sativa (Poaceae) and Eschscholzia californica (Papaveraceae). Previously published protocols were improved in processing speed by reducing the vacuum intensity and incubation time during tissue fixation and incubation time and cryoprotection and by applying adhesive tape. The sample preparation and sectioning of complex and heterogenous flowers produced adequate histological quality and subsequent RNA extraction from micro-dissected gynoecia reliably generated samples of sufficient quality and quantity on all species for RNA-seq. Expression analysis of growth stage specific A. thaliana and O. sativa transcriptomes showed distinct patterns of expression of chromatin remodelers on different time points of gynoecium morphogenesis from the initiation of development to post-meiotic stages. Conclusion: Here we describe a protocol for plant tissue preparation, cryoprotection, cryo-sectioning, laser microdissection and RNA sample preparation for Illumina sequencing of complex plant organs from three phyletically distant plant species. We are confident that this approach is widely applicable to other plant species to enable transcriptome analysis with high spatial resolution in non-model plant species. The protocol is rapid, produces high quality sections of complex organs and results in RNA of adequate quality well suited for RNA-seq approaches. We provide detailed description of each stage of sample preparation with the quality and quantity measurements as well as an analysis of generated transcriptomes.

Different treatment modalities are available. Mechanical implant-related problems, however, and the preservation of the biological integrity of the humeral head remain unsolved. New implants providing angular stability are expected to maintain the intraoperative result of reduction until definitive healing. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the functional outcome and the complication rate of an angular and sliding stable antegrade interlocking nail for the treatment of displaced proximal humeral fractures. Materials and methods In a prospective study, 112 consecutive patients with displaced proximal humeral fractures were treated. Complete 12 months postoperative follow-up was available for 74 patients. Fracture types were classified according to the Neer-classification. Clinical, functional and radiographic follow-up evaluations were performed 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. The Constant Score (CS) was used to assess shoulder function. Results All fractures were united. The CS (MV +/- SD) of the injured side 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery were 42.1 +/- 15.1, 56.1 +/- 20.1 and 70.9 +/- 19.3, respectively. Patients sustaining Neer III and VI/3 fractures revealed better shoulder function (68.8 +/- 14.7, 74.9 +/- 17.6) 12 months postoperatively than those with Neer IV/4 fractures (60.7 +/- 23.2), where most complications occurred. Complications requiring surgical therapy were seen in a total of 24 patients (30%) and included backing out of screws in nails without peak inlay (20%; 2000-2003), protrusion of screws into the gleno-humeral joint (5%), loss of reduction with malunion (9%) and major tubercle displacement (7%). Conclusion The treatment of displaced proximal humeral fractures with an angular and sliding stable antegrade nail (Targon-PH) led to good functional results, especially in 2- and 3-part fractures. There exists a substantial risk for postoperative complications and bad motor function in Neer IV/4 fractures. Lateral backing out of screws was abolished by implant modifications (PEEK-inlay) from 2003 onwards. Additional tension wire banding of the major tubercle may further reduce the risk of secondary displacement.

This study evaluates the need for total hip replacement (THR) and hip-related functional outcomes in patients with displaced acetabular fractures treated with O-ARM guidance compared to those treated under C-ARM guidance. Materials and methods This is a prospective matched cohort study. Adult patients (35) with acetabular fractures operated under O-ARM guidance were included. These were matched (age, fracture type) to classically treated patients (35) from our data base. The primary outcome was the need for THR during three year follow-up period. Secondary outcomes were functional scores [Harris Hip score (HHS), Postel-Merle d'Aubigne (PMA)] and hip osteoarthritis grade at three year follow-up. Correlation between reduction gap and THR was evaluated. Results At three years, five patients were lost to follow-up in O-ARM group and four in control group. Two patients (6.66%) in the O-ARM group needed THR compared to eight patients in controls (25.80%) (p = 0.046). Hip X-ray osteoarthritis grade averaged 0.00 in patients without THR in O-ARM group compared to 0.22 in patients without THR in controls (p = 0.008). HHS averaged 95.79 in patients without THR in O-ARM group, compared to 93.82 in patients without THR in the control group (p = 0.41%). PMA averaged 17.25 in patients without THR in the O-ARM group compared to 17.04 in patients without THR in group 2 (p = 0.37). Evaluation of correlation between reduction gap and THR rate yielded OR = 1.22 (1.06-1.45). Discussion Increased accuracy in articular reduction, with per-operative three-dimensional control of impaction, in acetabular fractures led to significantly less need for THR in patients treated under O-ARM. Patients in both groups are comparable for functional outcomes because those with the lowest scores were offered THR. Per-operative cone beam guidance and navigation use are recommended in tertiary referral centres for acetabular trauma.

Identifying and repairing medial orbital wall defects by using appropriate materials improves patient outcome considerably; however, most related research has focused on orbital floor defect management rather than medial orbital wall treatment, and no consensus on repairing medial orbital wall fractures exists. Furthermore, medial orbital wall fracture is a main cause of posttraumatic enophthalmos. In this study, we introduce a modified surgical technique for repairing large medial wall fractures stably, also reviewed relevant literature and established an algorithm for managing medial orbital wall fractures. Methods: We reviewed the outcomes of facial trauma patients who underwent facial bone reduction and internal fixation surgery in our hospital between October 1, 2010, and October 1, 2013. The patients were all treated medial orbital wall reconstruction with porous polyethylene by using a transconjunctival approach with a caruncular extension for large medial orbital wall fractures. Medical records and radiologic images of the patients were reviewed retrospectively. The outcomes evaluated were trauma mechanism, clinical findings of ocular injury, preoperative and postoperative ocular symptoms, degree of enophthalmos, and orbital volume restoration after surgery. Results: Transconjunctival approach with a caruncular extension was performed without any complications. The incidence of diplopia was 47.4% and enophthalmos (>2 mm) was 31.6%, with no significant diplopia and enophthalmos after surgery. Patients were symptom-free on follow-up. The average enophthalmos was successfully corrected from 0.88 mm preoperatively to 0.26 mm and orbital volume was corrected from 26.22 to 22.99 cm(3) after surgery; these results also showed P less than 0.001. Conclusions: The current results suggest that the proposed method of medial orbital wall reconstruction, in which porous polyethylene is implanted by using a transconjunctival approach with a caruncular extension, yields favorable outcomes. The approach facilitates a wide visualization of the operative field, which provides sufficient working space for implant insertion and is consequently free from iatrogenic trauma or surgery-related complications.

Midterm clinical outcomes following arthroscopic transosseous rotator cuff repair	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SHOULDER SURGERY			English	Article						Arthroscopic transosseous rotator cuff repair; rotator cuff tear; shoulder arthroscopy; suture anchors	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; BIOMECHANICAL EVALUATION; STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY; SINGLE-ROW; SUTURE; TENDON; SUPRASPINATUS; FIXATION; TEARS; DEGENERATION	Purpose: Arthroscopic transosseous (TO) rotator cuff repair has recently emerged as a new option for surgical treatment of symptomatic rotator cuff tears. Limited data is available regarding outcomes using this technique. This study evaluated midterm clinical outcomes following a novel arthroscopic TO (anchorless) rotator cuff repair technique. Materials and Methods: A consecutive series of 107 patients and 109 shoulders underwent arthroscopic TO (anchorless) rotator cuff repair for a symptomatic full-thickness tear. Pre and postoperative range of motion (ROM) was compared at an average of 11.8 months. Postoperative outcome scores were obtained at an average of 38.0 months. Statistical analysis was performed to compare pre and postoperative ROM data. Univariate analysis was performed using Students t-test to compare the effect of other clinical characteristics on final outcome. Results: Statistically significant improvements were noted in forward flexion, external rotation and internal rotation (P < 0.0001). Average postoperative subjective shoulder value was 93.7, simple shoulder test 11.6, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score 94.6. According to ASES scores, results for the 109 shoulders available for final follow-up were excellent in 95 (87.1%), good in 8 (7.3%), fair in 3 (2.8%), and poor in 3 (2.8%). There was no difference in ROM or outcome scores in patients who underwent a concomitant biceps procedure (tenodesis or tenotomy) compared with those who did not. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in outcome between patients who underwent either biceps tenodesis or tenotomy. Age, history of "injury" preceding the onset of pain, tear size, number of TO tunnels required to perform the repair, and presence of fatty infiltration did not correlate with postoperative ROM or subjective outcome measures at final follow-up. Two complications and four failures were noted. Conclusions: Arthroscopic TO rotator cuff repair technique leads to statistically significant midterm improvement in ROM and satisfactory midterm subjective outcome scores with low complication/failure rates in patients with average medium-sized rotator cuff tears with minimal fatty infiltration. Further work is required to evaluate radiographic healing rates with this technique and to compare outcomes following suture anchor repair. Level of Evidence: Level IV.

Predictive factors of distal femoral fracture nonunion after lateral locked plating: A retrospective multicenter case-control study of 283 fractures	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Supracondylar; Distal femur fracture; Locked plating; Nonunion; LISS; Periprosthetic	INVASIVE STABILIZATION SYSTEM; FEMUR FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; LISS; REDUCTION; PLATES	Introduction: Reported initial success rates after lateral locked plating (LLP) of distal femur fractures have led to more concerning outcomes with reported nonunion rates now ranging from 0 to 21%. Reported factors associated with nonunion include comorbidities such as obesity, age and diabetes. In this study, our goal was to identify patient comorbidities, injury and construct characteristics that are independent predictors of nonunion risk in LLP of distal femur fractures; and to develop a predictive algorithm of nonunion risk, irrespective of institutional criteria for clinical intervention variability. Patients and methods: A retrospective review of 283 distal femoral fractures in 278 consecutive patients treated with LLP at three Level1 academic trauma centers. Nonunion was liberally defined as need for secondary procedure to manage poor healing based on unrestricted surgeon criteria. Patient demographics (age, gender), comorbidities (obesity, smoking, diabetes, chronic steroid use, dialysis), injury characteristics (AO type, periprosthetic fracture, open fracture, infection), and management factors (institution, reason for intervention, time to intervention, plate length, screw density, and plate material) were obtained for all participants. Multivariable analysis was performed using logistic regression to control for confounding in order to identify independent risk factors for nonunion. Results: 28 of the 283 fractures were treated for nonunion, 13 were referred to us from other institutions. Obesity (BMI > 30), open fracture, occurrence of infection, and use of stainless steel plate were significant independent risk factors (P < 0.01). A predictive algorithm demonstrates that when none of these variables are present (titanium instead of stainless steel) the risk of nonunion requiring intervention is 4%, but increases to 96% with all factors present. When a stainless plate is used, obesity alone carries a risk of 44% while infection alone a risk of 66%. While Chi-square testing suggested no institutional differences in nonunion rates, the time to intervention for nonunion varied inversely with nonunion rates between institutions, indicating varying trends in management approach. Discussion: Obesity, open fracture, occurrence of infection, and the use of stainless steel are prognostic risk factors of nonunion in distal femoral fractures treated with LLP independent of differing trends in how surgeons intervene in the management of nonunion.

Methods This was a single-center retrospective study involving 166 elderly patients with proximal humeral fractures between January and June 2015 in our hospital. Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 89 patients were finally enrolled in this study. The spiral CT scanning was performed on these patients, and the CT images were obtained by using MIMICS software. The CT values in axial, coronal, and sagittal images of healthy proximal humeri were measured using a circular region of interest (ROI) by Image J. The bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine and femoral neck was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Spearman rank correlation methods were used for analysis of the association between the proximal humerus average CT value (CTMean) and the lumbar spine as well as femoral neck BMD in patients with proximal humeral fractures, or osteoporotic patients. Results Among the included 89 patients, there were 26 males and 63 females, 69% and 84% of whom were diagnosed with osteoporosis, respectively. The lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD and the CTMean of the proximal humerus were higher in males than females with proximal humeral fractures (P < 0.05). This gender difference was also found in the osteoporotic patient population (P < 0.05). The Spearman rank correlation method showed that the lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD was closely related to the proximal humeral CTMean in males (r = 0.877, P = 0.000; r = 0.832, P = 0.000; respectively) and females (r = 0.806, P = 0.000; r = 0.616, P = 0.000; respectively) with proximal humeral fractures, as well as osteoporotic male (r = 0.745, P = 0.000; r = 0.575, P = 0.000; respectively) and female (r = 0.613, P = 0.000; r = 0.629, P = 0.000; respectively) patients. Conclusions The CT value of the proximal humerus is a rapid and accurate method by which bone quality can be assessed in elderly patients with proximal humeral fractures. Moreover, the CT value of the proximal humerus is an alternative measurement of BMD that can guide surgeons in selecting the appropriate internal fixation material.

However, clinical experience shows that even 3D imaging has limitations, especially regarding artifacts when implants are placed. The purpose of this study was to assess the difference between intraoperative 3D imaging and postoperative CT regarding reduction and implant placement. Methods: Twenty consecutive cases of acetabular fractures were selected with a complete set of intraoperative 3D imaging and postoperative CT data. The largest detectable step and the largest detectable gap were measured in all three standard planes. These values were compared between the 3D data sets and CT data sets. Additionally, possible correlations between the possible confounders age and BMI and the difference between 3D and CT values were tested. Results: The mean difference of largest visible step between the 3D imaging and CT scan was 2.0 +/- 1.8 mm (0.0-5.8, p = 0.02) in the axial, 1.3 +/- 1.4 mm (0.0-3.7, p = 0.15) in the sagittal and 1.9 +/- 2.4 mm (0.0-7.4, p = 0.22) in the coronal views. The mean difference of largest visible gap between the 3D imaging and CT scan was 3.1 +/- 3.6 mm (0.0-14.1, p = 0.03) in the axial, 4.6 +/- 2.7 mm (1.2-8.7, p = 0.001) in the sagittal and 3.5 +/- 4.0 mm (0.0-15.4, p = 0.06) in the coronal views. A positive correlation between the age and the difference in gap measurements in the sagittal view was shown (rho = 0.556, p = 0.011). Conclusions: Intraoperative 3D imaging is a valuable adjunct in assessing reduction and implant placement in acetabular fractures but has limitations due to artifacts caused by implant material. This can lead to missed malreduction and impairment of clinical outcome, so postoperative CT should be considered in these cases.

However, the efficacy of the two methods is still controversial and needs a comprehensive analysis. Objective: This meta-analysis was to investigate whether total hip arthroplasty (THA) is associated with lower reoperation rate, mortality, complications, better function and quality of life than hemiarthroplasty (HA) for patients with displaced femoral neck fractures. Materials and Methods: Thirty-one trials involving a total of 4324 patients were included. Six randomized controlled trials, 8 lower-quality randomized trials, and 17 retrospective cohort studies comparing HA with THA for displaced femoral neck fractures were assessed for eligibility. Incidence rate and risk ratios (RR) were pooled using random-effects or fixed-effects models depending on the heterogeneity of included studies. Results: Meta-analysis showed that THA was associated with a lower risk of reoperation (incidence rate 2.8%, 95%CI 1.8%-3.8%) compared with HA (incidence rate 7.4%, 95%CI 5.3%-9.6%) (RR = 0.42, 95%CI 0.30-0.58, P <0.001) and higher excellent and good rate by Harris hip score (RR = 1.12, 95%CI 1.06-1.19, P <0.001). There was a tendency of better prognosis in patients undergoing THA (RRmortality = 0.82, 95%CI 0.67-1.01), but it was not statistically significant (P = 0.067). However, there was a higher risk of dislocation in patients undergoing TEA (incidence rate 4.2%, 95%CI 2.7%-5.8%) compared with HA (incidence rate 2.3%, 95%CI 1.4%-3.2%) (RR = 1.79, 95%CI 1.24-2.57, P = 0.002), but there was no difference in both local infections and general complications (P=0.201 and P=0.712). Conclusion: THA can benefit patients of displaced femoral neck fractures with a reduced reoperation rate and better hip function, though it can result a higher incidence of postoperative dislocation. The impact of different hip arthroplasty on prognosis need further studies.

The challenge becomes even greater with previous multiple unsuccessful surgeries. The question of this study was: Does combining locked compression plating with non-vascularized fibular autograft in cases of resistant humeral diaphyseal nonunion yield reliable bony union and satisfactory functional outcome? Hypothesis: The use of non-vascularized fibular autograft in conjunction with locked compression plating will provide stable construct, enhance bony union and improve functional outcome in cases of resistant humeral diaphyseal nonunion. Materials and methods: Thirty-three patients with resistant humeral diaphyseal nonunion who were surgically managed combining non-vascularized fibular autograft fixed with locked compression plating in the period from January 2011 to June 2017, were retrospectively studied. All patients were followed-up for a minimum of 24 months. The time to union, the postoperative disability of arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) score, in addition to the possible complications including infection or nonunion were reported and analyzed. Results: Twenty-nine patients have achieved union at the final follow-up with a mean time to radiological union of 7.5 +/- 2.6 months (range: 3-12). The mean postoperative DASH score was 7.7 +/- 8.9 (range: 0-38.8) which was significantly better than the preoperative value (p < 0.001) and superior in the patients of aseptic nonunion (p = 0.04). Eight patients showed complications in the form of infection (four), nonunion (two cases), transient radial nerve palsy (one case) and one case of septic nonunion that was managed by two stage reconstruction using vascularized fibular autograft. There were comparable results in patients with either open or closed fractures. However, patients with septic nonunion experienced more significant complications (p = 0.02). Discussion: The use of non-vascularized fibula autograft in cases of resistant humeral diaphyseal nonunion provides adequate fracture stability, quadrilateral screw purchase, enhances bony union in addition to promoting satisfactory functional outcome particularly in aseptic nonunion.

WHOQOL-BREF Hindi questionnaire: Quality of life assessment in acetabular fracture patients	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Acetabular fractures; Matta's radiological criteria; Merle d'Aubgne and Harris hip score; World Health Organization quality of life-BREF Hindi score	MUSCULOSKELETAL FUNCTION ASSESSMENT; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; POSTERIOR WALL; FOLLOW-UP; CLASSIFICATION; OUTCOMES	Background: The incidence of acetabular fractures in India has increased over the past years but so has the operating skills of pelvi-acetabular trauma surgeons. The outcomes of surgical management need to be assessed so as to be able to devise proper treatment plan and execute the same during and after surgery, which in turn requires assessment of quality of life indices as well as functional scores. While there are studies assessing Harris Hip scores (HHS) and world health organization quality of life BREF (WHOQOL BREF) in the western population there is no study which assesses the same in Indian population. We designed this study to evaluate and define reference values for use of WHOQOL BREF Hindi scores in QOL Assessment in patients with acetabular fractures and to assess the relationship between it and HHS. Materials and Methods: 118 patients with acetabular fractures who were treated surgically were included in this retrospective study. Assessment of reduction quality (Matta's radiological criteria), clinical outcome (HHS) and functional outcome (WHOQOL-BREF score) were done. The affect of age, gender, fracture displacement, hip dislocation, delay in surgery and associated injury on the clinical and functional outcome was evaluated. Results: The mean HHS was 90.65 (42-100) which showed an overall good to excellent outcome in 78.8% cases. WHOQOL-BREF Hindi score of domain-one was 63.06 +/- 20.31 (13-94), of domain-two was 58.22 +/- 19.57 (13-100), of domain-three was 70.49 +/- 17.92 (13-100) and of domain-four was 64.48 +/- 18.46 (13-100), which showed significant functional deficit in domain-one (P = 0.0001) and domain-two (P = 0.0001) but not in domain-three (P = 0.458) and domain-four (P = 0.722) when compared to score of general healthy population. The domain scores of general population norms were achieved in 59.3%, 61.9%, 69.5% and 66.1% cases in domain one, two, three and four respectively. Conclusions: Based on these results one can conclude that WHOQOL-Hindi questionnaire is good enough for assessment of QOL in addition to clinical measures in acetabular fracture patients.

The objective of this study is to identify predictive factors of acetabular erosion after bipolar hemiarthroplasty in a mobile independent population during a follow-up of ten years. Materials and methods: This multicenter study started in 1997 ending in 2007. Data were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Inclusion criteria were: age > 60 and < 85 years, BMI <35, normal Abbreviated MiniMental Test score, ability to walk 0.8 km and live independently, non-pathological fracture, hip with no or minimal osteoarthritic changes, and availability of clinical and radiological follow-up. For each Patient were recorded: demographic data, comorbidities, time from fracture to surgery, characteristics of the implant, duration of surgery. Patients included underwent clinical and radiological follow-up at a minimum of ten years. Results: Overall, 209 Patients met inclusion criteria. A press-fit implant was performed in 172 subjects; in contrast a cemented prosthesis was implanted in 37 patients. Nineteen patients underwent implant revision to total hip arthroplasty for acetabular erosion and pain. Classification of X-ray using Baker criteria showed a grade 0 in 54.5%, a grade 1 in 19.6%, a grade 2 in 18.1% and a grade 3 in 7.6%. Multivariate analysis revealed that the size of the femoral head (FH) was the only predictive factor of a higher risk of acetabular erosion. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve verified the risk of implant revision in Group 1 (FH sized > 48 mm) and Group 2 (FH sized < 48 mm). The probability of implant revision for acetabular erosion at ten years from surgery were 5.5% in Group 1 and 15.6% in Group 2. Conclusion: In bipolar hemiarthroplasty smaller head size lead to a polar wear implying a higher risk of acetabular erosion and migration; in our population this risk was consistent with the use of implant head < 48 mm diameter. Considering the absolute risk of a smaller FH size, the surgeon must evaluate the accuracy of measurement of the caliber, since as reported in previous studies, it can significantly underestimate the size.

The aim of this study was to determine how different strategies for recycling residual and green-manure biomass influence yield and N concentration of the edible parts of food crops in a stockless organic cropping system. For this purpose, three biomass distribution treatments were investigated in a field experiment, based on a cropping system designed to produce both high-quality food crops and biomass resources from crop residues, cover crops and a green-manure ley. The three treatments, applied at the cropping system level, were: (1) incorporating the aboveground biomass resources in situ (IS); (2) harvesting, ensiling and redistributing the same biomass resources to the non-legume crops (biomass redistribution, BR); and (3) harvesting, ensiling and using the biomass resources as substrate for production of bio-methane via anaerobic digestion (AD) followed by distribution of the digestate as bio-fertilizer to the non-legume crops. The redistribution of ensiled (BR) and digested (AD) biomass did not increase the yield of the edible parts in winter rye (Secale cereal L.), white cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.) or red beet (Beta vulgaris L.) compared with leaving the biomass on the ground at harvest (IS). The BR treatment increased the yield of lentil intercropped with oat, compared with IS treatment in one of the two studied years. The total biomass yield of the cover crop following winter rye was significantly higher in the BR treatment than in IS in both years. The legume proportion in the green-manure ley was significantly higher in the AD and BR treatments as compared with IS in one of the experimental years. This study showed that strategic biomass redistribution has the potential to enhance biomass productivity while maintaining food crop yields, thereby enhancing whole system productivity. Biomass redistribution systems both with and without biogas digestion offer a new strategy for the development of multifunctional arable cropping systems that rely on internal nutrient cycling.

Previous studies have reported lumbosacral hemivertebra resection through a combined anterior and posterior approach, but there have been no reports on the results and complications of hemivertebra resection via a posterior-only procedure and short fusion with large series of patients. Materials and methods This retrospective study of a prospective collected database comprises a consecutive series of 14 congenital scoliosis due to lumbosacral hemivertebra treated by 1-stage posterior hemivertebra resection with short segmental fusion, with at least a 2-year follow-up period (24-144 months). Surgical reports and patient charts were reviewed. Radiographic evaluation included measured changes in segmental scoliosis and lordosis, compensatory scoliosis, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, and trunk shift. Quality of life data from Scoliosis Research Society (SRS)-22 questionnaires were also collected. Results Our results showed that the mean follow-up period was 38.4 months. The mean fusion level was 3.2 segments. Mean operation time was 207.8 min with the average blood loss of 235.7 ml. The mean segmental scoliosis was 30 degrees preoperatively, 5 degrees postoperatively (83 % correction rate), and 4 degrees (87 %) at the latest follow-up. The compensatory coronal curve of 30 degrees was spontaneously corrected to 13 degrees at most recent follow-up. Trunk shift was significantly improved on both coronal (63 %) and sagittal plane (58 %) after the surgery, and kept stable during the follow-up. The total SRS-22 score, the self-image domain score and the satisfaction domain score demonstrated significant improvement compared with preoperative status. Only one intra-operative complication was observed, a pedicle fracture. Conclusions In summary, our results showed that one-stage HV resection and short segment fusion by a posterior approach can offer excellent scoliosis correction and trunk shift improvement without neurological complications, while saving motion segments as much as possible. This strategy is not only corrective of the deformity but also preventive of compensatory curve progression, thus avoiding long lumbar fusion.

Nowadays, there is not a gold standard for treatment. Aim of our study was to review our experience with the use of Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (RTSA) for the treatment of these fractures in the elderly, evaluating complications and functional results. Materials and Methods: Ninety-one patients older than 65 were treated with RTSA at our Institute between June 2005 and December 2017: there were 14 males and 77 females, with a mean age of 76 years (range 65-87 years). There were 58 fractures (20 Neer 3, 38 Neer 4) and 33 fracture-dislocations (7 Neer 3, 26 Neer 4). Complications were recorded, and functional outcomes were evaluated using the DASH score and Constant score (CS). Results: Twenty-three complications occurred: 8 cases of scapular notching, 5 neurologic palsies, 4 dislocations, 3 intraoperative diaphyseal fractures, and subclavian artery damage, deep infection, and radiolucent line in one each. No aseptic loosening or breakage was observed. Further surgeries were necessary in 3 cases only, whereas all patients retained their implant at last follow-up. Functional results were satisfactory: mean abduction was 93 degrees, mean flexion was 110 degrees, mean active internal-rotation reached 35 degrees, mean active external-rotation was 25 degrees, mean CS was 54 points and mean DASH score was 45 points. Discussion: Surgical treatment of complex PHFs should be a "one-shot surgery," especially in the elderly, since further surgeries could compromise patient outcomes and survival. Additional surgery due to complications is less frequent after RTSA than other techniques. A stable reconstruction permitting early mobilization is fundamental in the elderly. Usually, a prolonged immobilization is recommended after ORIF, TSA, and hemiarthroplasty to provide a stable fixation, whereas RTSA allows early mobilization. Conclusions: In elderly with inadequate bone stock and needing early recovery of autonomy in daily activities, RTSA effectively treats complex PHFs. The incidence of complications requiring revision surgery is low and functional results are satisfactory and predictable. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Treatment of scaphoid waist nonunion by one, two headless compression screws or plate with or without additional extracorporeal shockwave therapy	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						Combined treatment; Headless compression screw; Extracorporeal shockwave therapy; Nonunion; Non-union; Outcome; Pseudarthrosis; Scaphoid; Shockwave therapy; Surgery; Plate	WAVE THERAPY; INTERNAL-FIXATION; OPEN REDUCTION; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; PARTIAL ARTHRODESIS; OUTCOME MEASURE; NON-UNIONS; FRACTURES; STABILIZATION; RELIABILITY	IntroductionScaphoid nonunion remains challenging for hand surgeons. Several treatmentoptions are available such as: non-vascularized or vascularized bone grafting, with or without additional stabilization. In the last few decades, extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) has become an established procedure for treating delayed and nonunions. Purpose of this retrospective follow-up study was (a) to investigate union rate and clinical outcome of the different implants [either one/two headless compression screws (HCS) or a plate] and (b) union rate and clinical outcome using only surgery, or a combination of surgery and ESWT.Materials and methodsThe study included 42 patients with scaphoid nonunions of the waist with a mean follow-up of 52months. All patients received a non-vascularized bone graft from the iliac crest and stabilization was achieved by using one, two HCS or a plate. ESWT was performed with 3000 impulses, energy flux density per pulse 0.41mJ/mm(2) within 2weeks after surgery. Clinical assessment included range of motion (ROM), pain according to the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), grip strength, Disability of the Arm Shoulder and Hand Score, Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation Score, Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire and modified Green O'Brien (Mayo) Wrist Score. In addition, each patient had a CT scan of the wrist.ResultsA total of 33/42 (79%) patients showed union at the follow-up investigation. Patients treated with additional ESWT showed bony healing in 21/26 (81%) and without ESWT in 12/16 (75%). Patients that were stabilized using one HCS showed bony healing in 6/10 (60%), with two HCS 10/12 (83%) and by plate 17/20 (85%). The ESWT group had a significantly lower pain score according to the VAS and better modified Green O'Brien (Mayo) Score. No differences could be found in respect of ROM, grip strength, functional outcome score depending of which stabilization method was used.ConclusionsStabilization of scaphoid waist nonunions with two HCS or plate showed higher union rates than a stabilization using only one HCS. In addition, ESWT combined with a nonvascularized bone graft from the iliac crest seems a suitable option for treating scaphoid nonunions.

With the newest generation of polyaxial locking plates and the proven retrograde femoral nails today two minimally invasive surgical procedures have been established. Indications for both procedures overlap. This study attempts to define the strength and failure mode of both surgical procedures. A standardized fracture model was established to simulate an unstable AO/OTA 33-A3 fracture. Eight pairs of human cadaver femora (mean age 79 years, range 63-100 years) with compromised bone quality were used. Osteosyntheses with eight retrograde femoral nails and eight locking plates were randomly performed. A materials testing machine (Instron 5566) was used to perform cyclic stress tests according to a standardized loading protocol, up to a maximum load of 5,000 N. All specimens survived loading of at least 2,500 N. Three nail and one plate construct survived a maximum load of 5,000 N. The mean compressive force leading to failure was 4,400 N (CI 4,122-4,678 N) for nail osteosynthesis and 4,429 N (CI 3,653-5,204 N) for plate osteosynthesis (p = 0.943). Proximal cutting out of the osteosynthesis was the most common reason for interruption in the nail and plate osteosyntheses. Significant differences between the retrograde femoral nail and plate osteosyntheses were seen under testing conditions for plastic deformation and stiffness of the constructs (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively). Based on our results, no statements regarding the superiority of either of the devices can be made. Even though the load to failure values for both osteosyntheses were much higher than the loads experienced during normal walking; however, because only axial loading was applied, it remains unclear whether both osteosyntheses meet the estimated requirements for postoperative full weight-bearing for an average heavy patient with a distal femoral fracture.

The objective of this multicenter study is to identify predictive factors of acetabular erosion after bipolar hemiarthroplasty (surgery between 1997 and 2007) in a mobile independent population during a follow-up of ten years. Materials and methods: Data were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Inclusion criteria were: age >60 and <85 years, BMI < 35, normal Abbreviated MiniMental Test score, ability to walk 0.8 km and live independently, non-pathological fracture, hip with no or minimal osteoarthritic changes, and availability of clinical and radiological follow-up. For each Patient were recorded: demographic data, comorbidities, time from fracture to surgery, characteristics of the implant, duration of surgery. Patients included underwent clinical and radiological follow-up. Results: Overall, 209 Patients met inclusion criteria. A press-fit implant was performed in 172 subjects; in contrast a cemented prosthesis was implanted in 37 patients. Nineteen patients underwent implant revision to total hip arthroplasty for acetabular erosion and pain. Classification of X-ray using Baker criteria showed a grade 0 in 54.5%, a grade 1 in 19.6%, a grade 2 in 18.1% and a grade 3 in 7.6%. Multivariate analysis revealed that the size of the femoral head (FH) was the only predictive factor of a higher risk of acetabular erosion. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve verified the risk of implant revision in Group 1 (FH sized >48 mm) and Group 2 (FH sized <48 mm). The probability of implant revision for acetabular erosion at ten years from surgery were 5.5% in Group 1 and 15.6% in Group 2. Conclusion: In bipolar hemiarthroplasty smaller head size lead to a polar wear implying a higher risk of acetabular erosion and migration; in our population this risk was consistent with the use of implant head <48 mm diameter. Considering the absolute risk of a smaller FH size, the surgeon must evaluate the accuracy of measurement of the caliber, since the size can be significantly underestimated.

This study compares intra-operative radiation dose using posterior internal fixation using impedancemetry-guided pedicle positioning by the Pediguard system versus standard free-hand sighting when surgery was performed with a trainee or expert surgeon. Material and methods Using the electrical properties of bone, the Pediguard detects iatrogenic penetration of the pedicle wall and gives auditory feedback to the surgeon. A single centre, two surgeons (one experienced and the other novice) conducted a continuous prospective randomized study for one year. Twenty patients were randomized into one group (free-hand control group) receiving pedicle instrumentation without the use of the Pediguard and the second group receiving pedicle instrumentation with the use of the Pediguard. The total screw placement times and fluoroscopic times for each screw was recorded and pedicle screw position was analyzed on post-operative CT scan. Results Among the 104 screwed pedicles, 22 unrecognized perforations were detected by CT scan, while no perforation signal was observed intra-operatively. Only one perforation was greater than 2 mm. The overall screwing time was 4.33 +/- 1.2 minutes per screw for experienced surgeon and 5.84 +/- 2.5 minutes per screw for the novice. Pediguard did not increased significantly the time (0.3 mn per screw) for the experienced surgeon, but the time with Pediguard was longer (2 mn more per screw) for the novice surgeon, particularly at the thoracic level. The overall fluoroscopic average time per screw for the experienced surgeon is 5.8 +/- 2.3 s and 10.4 +/- 4.5 s for the novice surgeon. For the novice surgeon, radiation time reduced from 12 (without Pediguard) to 6 s (with Pediguard). There was no significant difference for the experienced surgeon in terms of improvement in radiation time with the use of Pediguard. Conclusion The overall time was longer for the novice surgeon with the Pediguard system, but allowed to decrease by 50% the fluoroscopy time.

Accidental dislodgment is one of the most frequent causes of avoidable cost and consternation related to gastrostomy tubes. The Sacks-Vine gastrostomy tube, inserted in an antegrade fashion by a percutaneous technique, is extremely stable due to the construction of its disc retention device. However, transmural migration of the retention disc is a known severe delayed complication associated with this tube. Objective. To review the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of transmural migration of gastrostomy retention discs, to propose a mechanism for the progressive development of this complication, and to recommend a method for preventing its occurrence. Materials and methods. From January 1991 to October 1999, pediatric interventional radiologists at two children's hospitals performed 300 antegrade gastrostomy and gastrojejunostomy primary insertion procedures. A "push-pull" variation of the antegrade approach used for 44 of these insertions is excluded from further analysis. Of the remaining 256 procedures, 5 boys and 3 girls with a mean age of 5.1 years (range 0.8-19 years) were identified from review of the prospectively gathered procedural database with significant complications related to the disc retention component of their gastrostomy tubes. A retrospective analysis was conducted of their medical records, diagnostic imaging, and interventional and surgical findings. Results. Transmural migration was diagnosed on average 36 months after insertion (16-48 months). The diagnosis was made incidentally during endoscopy (n=1) or fluoroscopy (n=5) in six asymptomatic patients, and during barium enema to explore feculent vomiting and halitosis in two symptomatic patients. Migration of the retention disc fell along a continuum from intramural (n=4) to transmural and intracolonic (n=4), with gastric mucosal erosion, extensive granulation and inflammation in all eight patients. Although there was no evidence of free air in any patient, a gastrocolic fistula was demonstrated in four patients and a gastrocolocutaneous fistula in two of four patients with complete transmural migration. Surgical resection of the disc, gastrostomy, and fistula repair if needed was successfully performed in all patients. Conclusions. Gastrostomy tubes with an internal retention disc are at risk for progressive disc migration into and through the gastric wall, resulting in irretrievable fixation and potential fistula formation. This severe delayed complication results from prolonged traction on the retention disc. Transmural migration may be avoided through improved tube care education, daily disc mobilization, and earlier disc retrieval.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the results of treatment of these complex defects with implantation of an osteochondral scaffold, which is designed to target the cartilage surface and to reconstruct joint anatomy by addressing the entire osteochondral unit. Materials and methods: Eleven patients (5 female and 6 male) with a mean age of 37.3 +/- 11.0 years and osteochondral lesions of the tibial plateau (mean 5.1 +/- 2.7 cm(2); range 3.0-12.5 cm(2)) were treated with the implantation of an osteochondral biomimetic collagen-hydroxyapatite scaffold (Maioregen (R), Fin-Ceramica, Faenza, Italy). Comorbidities were addressed taking care to restore the correct limb alignment. Patients were evaluated pre-operatively and prospectively followed-up for 2 years using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective and objective scores; activity level was documented using the Tegner score. Results: Three patients experienced minor adverse events. No patients required further surgery for treatment failure during the study follow-up period, and 8 patients (72.7%) reported a marked improvement. The IKDC subjective score improved from 42.5 +/- 10.2 before treatment to 69.8 +/- 19.0 at 12 months (p < 0.05), with stable results at 24 months. The IKDC objective score increased from 27.3% normal and nearly normal knees before treatment to 85.7% normal and nearly normal knees at 24 months of follow-up. The Tegner score increased from 2.3 +/- 2.1 before treatment to 4.8 +/- 2.4 at 12 months (p < 0.05), and was stable at the final follow-up. Conclusion: The present study on the implantation of an osteochondral scaffold for the treatment of tibial plateau lesions showed a promising clinical outcome at short-term follow-up, which indicates that this procedure can be considered as a possible treatment option, even in these complex defects, when comorbidities are concomitantly addressed.

The abducens nerve: its topography and anatomical variations in intracranial course with clinical commentary	FOLIA MORPHOLOGICA			English	Article						abducens nerve palsy; cavernous sinus; duplicated abducens nerve; petrosphenoidal (Gruber's) ligament; petroclival region; posterior clinoid process	INTERNAL CAROTID-ARTERY; MICROSURGICAL ANATOMY; TRANSCAVERNOUS APPROACH; PREPONTINE CISTERNS; PETROCLIVAL REGION; CAVERNOUS SINUS; CRANIAL NERVES; PALSY; SURGERY	Background: The sixth cranial nerve (CN VI) - or the abducens nerve - in humans supplies only the lateral rectus muscle. Due to its topographic conditions, including angulations and fixation points along its course from the brainstem to the lateral rectus muscle, the CN VI is vulnerable to injury. Every case of CN VI palsy requires precise diagnostics, which is facilitated by an understanding of the anatomy. The present article's aims include a detailed study of the intracranial course of the CN VI, determination of occurrence of its particular anatomical variations, as well as presentation of some essential anatomical conditions which may conduce to CN VI palsy. Special emphasis was put on the correlation between craniometric measurements and a particular variation of the CN VI, which complements the data that can be found in literature. Materials and methods: Twenty randomly selected specimens of cadaveric heads fixed in a 10% formalin solution were studied. The study used 40 specimens of the CN VI in order to examine its course variations within the section between the pontomedullary sulcus and the superior orbital fissure. Results: Detailed analysis of the CN VI topography and anatomy in its intracranial course revealed 3 anatomical variations of the nerve in the studied specimens. Variation I, found in 70% of cases, covers those cases in which the CN VI was found to be a single trunk. Those cases in which there was a branching of the CN VI exclusively inside the cavernous sinus were classified as variation II, occurring in 20% of cases. Cases of duplication of the CN VI were classified as variation III, found in 10% of the specimens. In 75% of cases of CN VI duplication one of the nerve trunks ran upwards from the petrosphenoidal ligament, outside Dorello's canal. Conclusions: The CN VI throughout its intracranial course usually runs as a single trunk, however, common variations include also branching of the nerve in the cavernous sinus or duplication. Topographic relations of the CN VI with adjacent structures account for the risk of injuries which may be caused to the nerve as a result of a disease or surgical procedures.

J	Oskierski, HC; Dlugogorski, BZ; Jacobsen, G				Oskierski, Hans C.; Dlugogorski, Bogdan Z.; Jacobsen, Geraldine			Sequestration of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> in chrysotile mine tailings of the Woodsreef Asbestos Mine, Australia: Quantitative mineralogy, isotopic fingerprinting and carbonation rates	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY			English	Article						Mineral sequestration of CO2; Carbonation rate; Serpentinite; Mine tailings; Weathering; Radiocarbon	NEW-SOUTH-WALES; NEW-ENGLAND OROGEN; PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE; FRACTIONATION; DIOXIDE; PERIDOTITE; FIXATION; STORAGE; BRUCITE	Since closure of the Woodsreef Asbestos Mine, located in the Great Serpentinite Belt (GSB), New South Wales, Australia, extensive carbonate-rich crusts have formed by recessive weathering of fine-grained material on the surface of the tailings pile. A relationship exists between the mode of carbonate occurrence, the mineralogy and the isotopic fingerprint of carbonates from the tailings pile. Vertical carbonate crusts, covering most of the tailings, predominantly consist of the hydrated Mg-carbonate hydromagnesite (Mg-5(CO3)(4)(OH)(2)center dot 4H(2)O), which has precipitated from evaporating meteoric waters incorporating atmospheric CO2, as reflected in high delta O-18, delta C-13 and (FC)-C-14 signatures, respectively. Low and variable concentrations of magnesite, dolomite and calcite represent bedrock carbonate, which has formed during alteration of the serpentinite bedrock before mining and is characterised bymoderately high delta O-18, delta C-13 and (FC)-C-14, a signature typical for ` weathering-derived' magnesite deposits in the GSB. The carbonate fraction of deep cement samples, collected from 70 to 120 cm below the surface, representing the bulk tailings material at depth, predominantly consists of pyroaurite (Mg6Fe2(CO3)(OH)(16)center dot 4H(2)O) and, despite stable isotope signatures similar to bedrock, contains significant radiocarbon. This indicates that pyroaurite, forming under different conditions as hydromagnesite, may represent an additional trap for atmospheric CO2 in the Woodsreef mine tailings. The distribution of carbonates and quartz, together with the absence of isotopic mixing trends between bedrock carbonate and atmospheric-derived carbonate, strongly indicates that dissolution and re-precipitation of bedrock carbonate is not a dominant process in theWoodsreef tailings. The cations for carbonate formation are instead derived fromthe dissolution of serpentine minerals (lizardite and chrysotile) and brucite. The internal standard method and the reference intensity method have been used with X-ray diffraction data to estimate the abundance of the two major carbonate minerals hydromagnesite and pyroaurite, respectively. Considering the formation of hydromagnesite on the outer surface of the tailings pile alone or together with formation of pyroauritewithin the tailings pilewe conclude that, between 1400 and 70,000 t of atmospheric CO2 have been sequestered in the mine tailings since closure of the mine 29 a ago. Carbonation rates of 27 g C m(-2) y-1 and 1330 g C m(-2) y(-1) are significantly higher than background rates of CO2 uptake by chemical weathering and demonstrate the potential of passive carbonation of mine tailings as a cost and energy effective alternative for storage of CO2 in carbonate minerals.

Study Design-In vitro mechanical study. Sample Population-Bone substitute material (24 tubes) was cut at 20 degrees to the long axis of the tube to simulate an oblique mid-shaft fracture. Methods-Tubes were divided into 4 groups (n = 6) and double plated in an orthogonal configuration, with I screw of I implant being inserted in lag fashion through the "fracture". Thus, the groups were: (1) 2 DCP implants (4.5, broad, 10 holes); (2) 2 LC-DCP implants (5.5, broad, 10 holes); (3) 2 LCP implants (4.5/5.0, broad, 10 holes) and 4 head locking screws/plate; and (4) 2 CRIF (4.5/5.0) and 10 clamps in alternating position left and right of the rod. All constructs were tested in 4-point bending with a quasi-static load until failure. The implant with the interfragmentary screw was always positioned on the tension side of the construct. Force, displacement, and angular displacement at the "fracture" line were determined. Construct stiffness under low and high loads, yield strength, ultimate strength, and maximum angular displacement were determined. Results-None of the implants failed; the strength of the bone substitute was the limiting factor. At low loads, no differences in stiffness were found among groups, but LCP constructs were stiffer than other constructs under high loads (P=.004). Ultimate strength was lowest in the LCP group (P=.01), whereas yield strength was highest for LCP constructs (409 Nm, P=.004). CRIF had the lowest yield strength (117 Nm, P=.004); no differences in yield strength (250 Nm) were found between DCP and LC-DCP constructs. Differences were found for maximum angular displacement at the "fracture" line, between groups: LPC < DCP < LC-DCP < CRIF (P < .037). Conclusions-DCP, LC-DCP, and LCP constructs provided sufficient biomechanical stability to withstand single-cycle loads that might be experienced postoperatively. LCP constructs showed the best performance because of the highest yield strength, above which irreversible deformation occurred. Inadequate biomechanical properties, excessive motion, and shape of the device create concern about the use of CRIF in these large sizes. Clinical Relevance-CRIF does not meet the demands for equine long-bone fracture treatment. With respect to biomechanical properties, DCP, LC-DCP, and LCP constructs did not show critical differences so other factors may direct clinical selection of these implants. We prefer the LCP implants because of the high yield strength, high stiffness under high-load application, and the least movement at the fracture line.

J	Fernandez, FF; Ihle, C; Ziegler, P; Wirth, T; Eberhardt, O				Fernandez, Francisco Fernandez; Ihle, Christoph; Ziegler, Patrick; Wirth, Thomas; Eberhardt, Oliver			Fractures of the Humeral Ulnar Condyle in Children - a Rare but Complicated Injury	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ORTHOPADIE UND UNFALLCHIRURGIE			English	Article						children; ulnar condyle fracture; nonunion; complications	MEDIAL CONDYLE; ROTATIONAL DISPLACEMENT	Background Ulnar humeral condyle fractures are rare paediatric elbow fractures, classified as Salter-Harris IV paediatric elbow injuries. Due to constant radiological changes in the elbow with varying manifestation of ossification centres as well as late ossification of the trochlea, diagnosis of these injuries is challenging. To avoid long-term complications, the treating surgeon should be familiar with the rare injury picture, diagnostics and adequate therapeutic measures. Material and Methods The present retrospective study includes data on all paediatric cases from2002 to 2019 with primary or secondary treatment at a paediatric traumatology centre for ulnar condyle fracture with a minimum follow-up of 12 months. Range of motion, joint stability under valgus and varus stress as well as axial ratios of the injured and uninjured side were evaluated in a clinical follow-up examination. The Mayo Elbow Performance Score was used to objectify functional results. Results 20 children, average age 8.6 years (4-13) and average follow- up time 25 months, were included. Radiological evaluation based on Jakob and Fowles classification revealed a type I fracture in three cases, a type II fracture in one case and a type III fracture in 16 cases. Three cases were treated nonoperatively with an upper arm cast. 17 children were treated with open reduction and internal fixation. Diagnosis of three fractures was delayed. No postoperative complications such as infections, nerve damage or nonunions. 15 children showed free elbow function. Three children showed slightly restricted elbow extension by less than 10 degrees and two by 10 degrees-20 degrees. All children showed free pro/supination. 18 children showed a physiological and bilaterally identical arm axis compared to the uninjured side. Two children showed a slightly increased cubitus valgus with a 5-10 degrees difference between sides. Radiologically, two children with delayed fracture treatment showed partial necrosis of the trochlea. The Mayo Elbow Score showed good (2) to excellent results in all children (18). Conclusion Very good clinical and functional results can be expected if the injury is diagnosed without delay followed by adequate therapy. Misdiagnosis of ulnar condyle fractures can be associated with the development of nonunions and functional restrictions as well as, after operative therapy, trochlear necrosis. Children up to the age of 6 in particular are at risk of misdiagnosis due to faulty assessment of the cartilaginous trochlea.

BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS			English	Article								BackgroundIn the modern western world appraisal of economical points such as treatment and disability after trauma present a financial burden. In this context open reduction internal fixation techniques allowing for early full weight bearing might not only improve the clinical outcome but also shorten the period of disability in working life. The aim of the study was to analyze whether ORIF of ankle fractures using either a standard semitubular plate or a new polyaxial locking plate system result in a better clinical outcome.MethodsIn this prospective study, all patients with distal fibula fractures (AO 44 B1.1, B1.2, B1.3), with indication for surgery were included. Patients were randomized to either the DePuy Synthes (R) one-third semitubular plate (Group I) or NEWCLIP TECHNICS, Active Ankle (R) polyaxial locking plate (Group II). Primary outcome parameter was function of the ankle joint, assessed by the Olerud and Molander ankle score, Foot and Ankle outcome score and Karlsson and Peterson Scoring System for Ankle function. Secondary outcome parameter were postoperative complications. Superficial wound infection, delayed wound healing, mechanically prominent implant, skin irritations were considered as minor and deep wound infection, material loosening, loss of reduction were regarded as major complications requiring revision surgery. Clinical and radiological follow-up were performed 6 and 12weeks, 6months and 1year postoperatively.ResultsFifty-two patients (31W/21M) with a mean age of 43yrs. (range 22-64yrs.) were enrolled. Seven patients (13.5%) were excluded, so that 45 patients were available for follow up. Twenty-five patients were treated with DePuy Synthes (R) one-third semitubular plate (55.6%; group I) while 20 patients received an anatomically preformed polyaxial locking plate (44.4%, group II). Four minor complications occurred in Group I (16%) compared to two minor complications in group II (10%). Significant better clinical results regarding OMAS (p <0.02, <0.04), KPSS (p <0.04) and FAOS (p <0.02, <0.03) were observed 6 and 12weeks after surgery in group II.ConclusionsThe results of the presented study demonstrate a significant better clinical functional outcome in the early postoperative follow-up in patients treated with a polyaxial locking plate. Furthermore, our data show that ORIF using polyaxial locking plates in combination with an early postoperative weight bearing presents a safe, stable treatment option for ankle fractures so that patients benefit especially in the early stages of recovery.Trial registrationRegistered 20 April 2020, retrospectively on ClinicalTrails.gov (NCT04370561).

Unlike most pediatric fractures, there is a risk of unsatisfactory results in forearm shaft fractures. The healing of a tubular bone is most unlikely in the diaphysis far away from the metaphyseal zones. The treatment of forearm shaft fractures is evolving. The purpose of the study was to analyze the pattern of forearm shaft fractures and their treatment in a population of children in recent years. Materials and Methods All the children (from 0 to 16 years) with a both-bone forearm shaft fracture (AO-segment 22-D) during the years 1997 to 2009 in a catchment area of about 86,000 children were included in this population-based study. There were 291 fractures in all. The age-related annual incidences, background factors, seasonal variation, injury types, treatment, reoperations, and short-term outcome were determined. Results The incidence of all forearm shaft fractures increased threefold in 1997 to 2009 (p < 0.001). Boys predominated (70%) over the girls (p < 0.001). The mean age of the patients was 8.7 years (SD, +/- 3.8) among both genders. The fractures were most common in August and most uncommon in December (p < 0.001). A fall in the playground was the most common type of injury (34%). Ninety-two percent of all patients (N = 269) were treated in the operating room and 44% (N = 119) were invasively stabilized. The incidence of invasive surgery held stable. However, elastic stable intramedullary nailing (ESIN) increased from 10% in 1998-2000 to 30% in 2007-2009 (p = 0.043). There were 77 reoperations (26%); reoperation rate was 5% (6/119) and 41% (N = 71/172) in the invasive and non-invasive treatment groups, respectively. Twenty-three percent of the patients referred did not have better than good short-term results. The excellent short-term outcome was increasing (p = 0.031). Conclusions We found two mega-trends in pediatric forearm shaft fractures in the period from 1997 to 2009: First, the number of fractures was increasing significantly. Second, the forearm shaft fractures were increasingly treated by an invasive intramedullary method. We also found a significant seasonal variation, but the reason for it is not clear. The findings are based on valuable population-based data and the results are certain. Pediatric trauma centres should prepare themselves for on-going changes in forearm shaft fractures.

Mechanical characterization of structurally porous biomaterials built via additive manufacturing: experiments, predictive models, and design maps for load-bearing bone replacement implants	ACTA BIOMATERIALIA			English	Article						Structurally porous biomaterial; Mechanical characterization; Additive manufacturing; Design maps; Bone replacement implants	BEHAVIOR; INGROWTH; TI6AL4V; SCAFFOLDS; METALS; HOMOGENIZATION; ARCHITECTURE; FABRICATION; MORPHOLOGY; INTERFACE	Porous biomaterials can be additively manufactured with micro-architecture tailored to satisfy the stringent mechano-biological requirements imposed by bone replacement implants. In a previous investigation, we introduced structurally porous biomaterials, featuring strength five times stronger than commercially available porous materials, and confirmed their bone ingrowth capability in an in vivo canine model. While encouraging, the manufactured biomaterials showed geometric mismatches between their internal porous architecture and that of its as-designed counterpart, as well as discrepancies between predicted and tested mechanical properties, issues not fully elucidated. In this work, we propose a systematic approach integrating computed tomography, mechanical testing, and statistical analysis of geometric imperfections to generate statistical based numerical models of high-strength additively manufactured porous biomaterials. The method is used to develop morphology and mechanical maps that illustrate the role played by pore size, porosity, strut thickness, and topology on the relations governing their elastic modulus and compressive yield strength. Overall, there are mismatches between the mechanical properties of ideal-geometry models and as-manufactured porous biomaterials with average errors of 49% and 41% respectively for compressive elastic modulus and yield strength. The proposed methodology gives more accurate predictions for the compressive stiffness and the compressive strength properties with-a reduction of the average error to 11-% and 7.6%. The implications-of the results and the methodology here introduced are discussed in the relevant biomechanical and clinical context, with insight that highlights promises and limitations of additively manufactured porous biomaterials for load-bearing bone replacement implants. Statement of Significance In this work, we perform mechanical characterization of load-bearing porous biomaterials for bone replacement over their entire design space. Results capture the shift in geometry and mechanical properties between as-designed and as-manufactured biomaterials induced by additive manufacturing. Characterization of this shift is crucial to ensure appropriate manufacturing of bone replacement implants that enable biological fixation through bone ingrowth as well as mechanical property harmonization with the native bone tissue. In addition, we propose a method to include manufacturing imperfections in the numerical models that can reduce the discrepancy between predicted and tested properties. The results give insight into the use of structurally porous biomaterials for the design and additive fabrication of load-bearing implants for bone replacement. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc.

There is a limited knowledge of how the outcome after a hip fracture in patients with diabetes affect Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). The primary aim of this study was to evaluate HRQoL. Secondary aims were reoperation rate, complications and functions in patients with diabetes followed for 2 years after a hip fracture. Materials and methods: Out of 2133 patients diabetes was present in 234 patients (11%). Main outcome measurements were HRQoL evaluated with EuroQoL 5-D-index score, reoperation rate, surgical and medical complications, function as walking ability, daily activities, living condition and pain. Results: Preoperatively, patients with diabetes mellitus had more pain (p = 0.044), co-morbidities, reduced health status (p = 0.001) and more often used a walking frame (p = 0.014) than patients without diabetes, whereas Katz ADL index, cognition and body mass index did not differ. There was no difference in fracture type, surgical method or reoperation between the two groups or between patients with insulin treated or oral treated diabetes. The EQ-5D(index) score decreased from 0.64 at admission to 0.45 at 4 months, 0.49 at 12 months and 0.51 at 24 months with similar results for patients with and without diabetes. During the first postoperative year there was not more medical complications among patients with diabetes, however cardiac (p = 0.023) and renal failure (p = 0.032) were more frequent in patients with diabetes at 24 months. Patients with diabetes more often had severe hip pain at 4 months (p = 0.031). At 12 months more diabetic patients were living independently (p = 0.034). There was no difference in walking ability, ADL and living condition between the groups at 24 months. Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that patients with diabetes mellitus had more pain, co-morbidities, reduced health status preoperatively than patients without diabetes. Hip fracture patients with diabetes mellitus have more hip pain at 4 months. Cardiac and renal failure was more frequent in patients with diabetes at 24 months but otherwise we found a comparable re-operation rate, function and deterioration of Health Related Quality of Life as patients without diabetes within 2 years after a hip fracture.

Societal burden and quality of life in patients with Lisfranc Injuries	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Lisfranc injuries; Burden of disease; Cost of illness; Quality of life; Societal perspective	REDUCTION INTERNAL-FIXATION; COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS; NONOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT; PRIMARY ARTHRODESIS; ILLNESS	Background:The incidence of Lisfranc fractures is rising, along with the incidence of foot fractures in general. These injuries can lead to long-term healthcare use and societal costs. Current economic evaluation studies are scarce in Lisfranc fracture research, and only investigate the healthcare costs. The aim of the present study was to accurately measure the monetary societal burden of disease and quality of life in the first 6 months after the injury in patients with Lisfranc fractures in the Netherlands. Materials and methods:This study used a prevalence-based, bottom-up approach. Patients were included through thirteen medical centres in the Netherlands. Both stable and unstable injuries were included. The societal perspective was used. The costs were measured at baseline, 12 weeks and 6 months using the iMTA MCQ and PCQ questionnaires. Reference prices were used for valuation. Quality-of-life was measured using the EQ-5D-5 L and VAS scores. Results:214 patients were included. The mean age was 45.9 years, and 24.3% of patients had comorbidities. The baseline questionnaires yielded approximately euro2023 as the total societal costs in the 3 months prior to injury. The follow-up questionnaires and surgery costs assessment yielded approximately euro17,083 as the total costs in the first 6 months after injury. Of these costs, approximately two thirds could be attributed to productivity losses. The EQ-5D-5 L found a mean index value of 0.449 at baseline and an index value of 0.737 at the 6-month follow-up. Conclusion:The total monetary societal costs in the first 6 months after injury are approximately euro17,083. Approximately two thirds of these costs can be attributed to productivity losses. These costs appear to be somewhat higher than those found in other studies. However, these studies only included the healthcare costs. Furthermore, the baseline costs indicate relatively low healthcare usage before the injury compared to the average Dutch patient. The mean QoL index was 0.462 at baseline and 0.737 at 6 months, indicating a rise in QoL after treatment as well as a long-lasting impact on QoL. To our knowledge, this is only the first study investi-gating the societal costs of Lisfranc injuries, so more research is needed.	[Boom, N. A.

CRIOAC-GSO	Post-traumatic bone and/or joint limb infections due to <i>Clostridium</i> spp.	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Wound infection; Bone infection; Anaerobic; Clostridium; Spores	PRESSURE PULSATILE LAVAGE; ANAEROBIC OSTEOMYELITIS; SEPTIC ARTHRITIS; INDUCED MEMBRANE; OPEN FRACTURES; MANAGEMENT; IDENTIFICATION; MICROBIOLOGY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; DIFFICILE	Background: Clostridium spp. are saprophytic Gram-positive bacteria found in soil and capable of generating endospores. Spore germination occurs when environmental conditions are favorable. Clostridium spp. can cause infections of compound fractures and deep wounds contaminated from soil micro-organisms. Hypothesis: Clostridium spp. infections of traffic-related injuries are particularly severe events whose outcome is uncertain even with aggressive medical and surgical treatment. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed 12 patients (median age, 45 years) with Clostridium spp. bone and/or joint infections complicating compound limb fractures with soil contamination and extensive soft-tissue damage. Prophylactic amoxicillin-clavulanic acid therapy was administred, followed by emergency surgical wound debridment and lavage. Fracture fixation was performed immediately in nine patients (external in four and internal in five) or at a later time on three patients. The immediate outcome was unfavourable in all 12 cases, requiring early reoperation after a median of 10 days (range, 5-25 days). Results: Median time to Clostridium strain identification was 14.5 days (range, 5-160). All infections were polymicrobial. Surgical wound excision, hardware removal (in four cases), and antibiotic therapy produced a favourable outcome in one patient, with no recurrence after 2 years of follow-up; the outcome was unfavourable in 11 cases, with delayed fracture union, septic non-union, impaired healing, and/or chronic sinus tract drainage. Several second-line treatments were used in these 11 patients: intramedullary nailing without bone grafting in four patients, with three failures; decortication and grafting in two patients, with failure in both; nailing with decortication in one patient, who had a good outcome; and the induced membrane procedure described by Masquelet in four patients, all of whom had good outcomes. After a median follow-up of 24 months (range, 18-53 months), the bone infection had subsided in eight patients. The remaining four patients had septic non-union. Discussion: Clostridium spp. infections are particularly severe. The diagnosis is delayed and identification of the organism is challenging. The treatment is difficult and results in unfavorable outcomes in one-third of cases. The identification of Clostridium in specimens from an osteoarticular infection indicates a need for extremely extensive and aggressive surgical resection, as spore resistance may impair the in vivo efficacy of antimicrobial agents.

Part II: Femoral osteotomy, prospective study of 6 cases	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Knee osteoarthritis; Extra-articular knee deformities; Same-stage total knee arthroplasty; Proximal femoral osteotomy		Background: Same-stage (1S) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and femoral osteotomy (FO) may deserve consideration in patients with both knee osteoarthritis and severe extra-articular knee deformity (EKD). The objective of this study was to assess clinical and radiological outcomes and morbidity (complications and revisions) in 6 patients managed with S1-TKA-FO. Hypothesis: 1S-TKA-F0 produces satisfactory outcomes and is not associated with higher morbidity rates compared to two-stage TKA-TO or TKA with intra-articular EKD correction, while also significantly shortening total treatment duration. Material and methods: A prospective study was performed in 6 patients managed with 1S-TKA-F0 between 1999 and 2011; mean age was 64 years (range, 59-72 years) and mean body mass index was 29.5 (range, 26-35). The EKD was consistently greater than 10 degrees. The cause was post-traumatic mal-union in 4 patients, constitutional EKD in 1 patient, and FO in 1 patient. In each patient, the clinical International Knee Society (MS) score and the hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), femoral mechanical angle (FMA) and tibial mechanical angle (TMA), were recorded prospectively before and after surgery. Results: A long uncemented extension stem was used in all 6 patients and a posterior-stabilised implant in 5 patients. No hinged implants were used. In 4 patients, internal fixation of the FO was performed. Mean follow-up was 10 years (range, 4-15 years). From baseline to last follow-up, the mean IKS score increased from 46 to 161 and mean flexion from 95 degrees (range, 70-110 degrees) to 107 degrees (range, 90-120 degrees). The HKA measured radiographically was between 178 degrees and 182 degrees in all 6 patients. The complications consisted of deep vein thrombosis in 1 patient and knee stiffness requiring manipulation under general anaesthesia in 1 patient. No patient experienced mal-union or required revision surgery. Discussion: Apart from a case-series study of 11 patients, very few data are available on 1S-TKA-FO. In our small population, no major complications were recorded. The encouraging long-term outcomes warrant a recommendation to perform 1S-TKA-F0 in patients with knee osteoarthritis and an intrafemoral deformity greater than 10 degrees.

Cement augmentation of the proximal femoral nail antirotation for the treatment of osteoporotic pertrochanteric fractures-A biomechanical cadaver study	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Cement augmentation; Proximal femoral nail antirotation; Osteoporosis; Pertrochanteric fracture; Biomechanics	HIP-FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; FEMUR FRACTURES; SCREW; BLADE; FAILURE; DEVICES; FORCES	Introduction: Proximal femoral fractures will gain increasing importance in the future due to the epidemiological development. Osteoporosis is often a limiting factor in the achievement of implant stability. New nailing systems offer the possibility of augmentation of the femoral neck component with cement. The aim of this study was to perform a biomechanical comparison of implant stability in osteoporotic pertrochanteric fractures using the proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA, Synthes GmbH, Umkirch, Germany) with cement augmented and non-augmented blades. Materials and methods: Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) in six pairs of fresh-frozen human femurs. Standardised pertrochanteric fractures (AO31-A2.3) were treated with a PFNA. Cement augmentation was performed in six constructs. Axial loading was applied according to a single-leg-stance model using a hydraulic testing machine increasing to 1400 N over 10,000 cycles. Biomechanical comparisons between the two groups that were comparable concerning BMD, tip-apex-distance and native stiffness were made with regard to postoperative stiffness, survived cycles, load to failure, failure mechanism and axial displacement. Results: The stiffness of all stabilised femurs was significantly lower than for native specimens (native 702.5 +/- 159.6 N/mm vs. postoperative 275.4 +/- 53.8 N/mm, p < 0.001). Stiffness after instrumentation was significantly greater for the cement augmented group than for the non-augmented group (300.6 +/- 46.7 N/mm vs. 250.3 +/- 51.6 N/mm, respectively, p = 0.001). Five of the twelve constructs survived cyclic testing. Statistically significant differences of the BMD were detected between survived and failed constructs (0.79 +/- 0.17 g/cm(2) vs. 0.45 +/- 0.12 g/cm(2), respectively, p = 0.028). The failure loads for specimens surviving 10,000 cycles were 4611.9 +/- 2078.9 N in the cement augmented group (n = 3) and 4516.3 N and 3253.5 N in the non-augmented group (n = 2). Postoperative stiffness was found to be a positive predictor of maximum force to failure (R-2 = 0.83, p = 0.02). Conclusions: The results of this biomechanical study show that cement augmentation of the PFNA increases the implant stability in osteoporotic pertrochanteric fractures. Further studies are necessary to evaluate this procedure in providing long term clinical results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Fensky, F.; Nuechtern, J. V.; Kolb, J.

Materials & Methods: Patients who underwent high-risk, elective ankle and hindfoot fusions treated with rhBMP-2 augmentation were reviewed for clinical outcomes and complications. A total of 112 fusion sites (69 patients) were reviewed for analysis. The mean age of the patients was 52 years (range, 21 to 84 years). There were 37 males (53%) and 32 females (47%). Forty-four patients (64%) were smokers and 13 patients (19%) were diabetic. A history of high-energy trauma was present in 47 (68%) patients and avascular necrosis of the talus was present in 22 patients (32%). Forty-five patients (65%) had multiple risk-factors. The exclusion criteria were peripheral vascular disease, infection, and patients who were not available for the usual follow-up protocol. Internal and/or external fixation was utilized for ankle and hindfoot fusions. Bone graft was used only for patients who had defects or malalignment. Postoperatively, nonweightbearing radiographs were taken every 2 to 4 weeks (3 views per site). When plain radiographic union was evident, a confirmatory CT scan was obtained. Results: Overall, 108 fusion sites went on to union (96% union rate) at a mean time of 11 weeks (as assessed by a CT scan) [ankle joint at 10 weeks; subtalar joint at 12.3 weeks; talonavicular joint at 12.7 weeks and calcaneocuboid joint at 10.9 weeks]. Different union times between ankle, subtalar, talonavicular, and calcaneocuboid joint were not significant (p = 0.2571, Kruskal-Wallis Test Nonparametric ANOVA). All sites: [No graft] vs. [Autograft] vs. [Allograft]: p = 0.2421 (Kruskal-Wallis Test Nonparametric ANOVA), were not statistically significant. Complications included nonunion in 5 of 11,2 joints in 3 patients (4% joint nonunion rate; 4% patient nonunion rate) [subtalar joint, n = 2; talonavicular joint, n = 1; and calcaneocuboid joint, n = 1]. Two patients had wound complications and one other patient had a deep infection; all were successfully treated with local wound care, negative-pressure dressings and antibiotics. Conclusion: We believe rhBMP-2 is an effective adjunct for bone healing in patients who undergo high-risk ankle and hindfoot fusions. Low complication rates were observed in this study.

The safety and feasibility of minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) on the medial side of the femur: A cadaveric injection study	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Femoral fracture; Minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO); Medial approach; Femoral artery	DISTAL FEMUR; INTERNAL-FIXATION; FEMORAL FRACTURES; OSTEOTOMY; IMPLANT	Introduction: Minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) on the medial side of the femur appears to be a dangerous procedure due to possible femoral artery injury. Objective: This study aims to determine the feasibility of applying MIPO of the femur via the medial approach, and to determine the anatomical relationship and structures at risk between the artery and the implant using computed tomography angiography. Materials and methods: A descriptive study of ten fresh cadavers was done. Two separate incisions were made, creating a submuscular tunnel close to the medial side of the femur. An 11- or 13-hole LCP lateral proximal tibial plate (5.0 mm) was inserted through the distal incision into the submuscular tunnel and fixed. A CT angiogram with 3D reconstruction was made to determine the distance from and location of the plate relative to the femoral artery and surgical dissection was done to identify the structures at risk. Results: No disruptions of superficial or deep femoral arteries were found. The closest distances from the superficial femoral artery and deep femoral artery to the plate were 8.3-27.2 mm (average 16.3 mm) (99% CI: 12.7-19.9) at the level 3 and 4.5-20.0 mm (average 8.6 mm) (99% CI: 6.4-10.9) at the level 2 in the proximal part of femur, respectively. The location where the SFA crossed the anterior cortex of the femur in the sagittal plane was 9.7-36.0% of the femoral length (average 20.1%) (99% CI: 15.0-25.3%) and the posterior cortex of the femur was 24.7-55.3% of the femoral length (average 40.8%) (99% CI: 35.0-46.7%). The location where the DFA crossed the anterior cortex of the femur in the sagittal plane was 7.9-25.3% of the femoral length (average 13.4%) (99% CI: 10.6-16.3%) and where it crossed the posterior cortex of the femur was 21.7-39.4% of the femoral length (average 31.2%) (99% CI: 27.1-33.3%). Conclusion: MIPO of the femur via medial approach is a feasible option for treatment of femoral fractures when the lateral approach is contraindicated. The distal 60% of the femoral length is safe for this approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AN 8-YEAR FOLLOW-UP STUDY OF 221 CONSECUTIVE HIP FRACTURE PATIENTS IN FINLAND: ANALYSIS OF REOPERATIONS AND THEIR DIRECT MEDICAL COSTS	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article						Hip fracture; postoperative complication; long-term follow-up; reoperation; survival; cost	FEMORAL-NECK FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; SURGERY; HEMIARTHROPLASTIES; MORTALITY	Background: Some hip fracture patients need one or more reoperations because of complications following initial operative treatment. Aims: The aim of this study was to identify all further surgical interventions in a cohort of patients with hip fractures over a period of 8 years after index fracture. Immediate direct costs of these reoperations were also calculated. Material and Methods: This retrospective study investigated 221 consecutive patients with hip fractures operated on at two different hospitals in southeastern Finland. The study period in hospital A was from 1 February 2003 to 31 January 2004, and in hospital B from 1 February 2003 to 30 April 2004. About 50% were femoral neck fractures, 41% trochanteric fractures, and 9% subtrochanteric fractures. Patients' medical records were checked from the hospital records and confirmed manually. Short- and long-term complications were recorded. Survival analysis was performed using a life-table method. The actual costs for reoperations and other further procedures for each patient were calculated using diagnosis-related groups-based costs for both hospitals in 2012. Results: A total of 20 patients (9%) needed reoperations. Overall, 10 patients (8.9%) with a femoral neck fracture (n=112), 8 patients (8.7%) with trochanteric fracture (n=92), and 2 patients (10.5%) with subtrochanteric fracture (n=19) were reoperated on. The median interval between the primary operation of the acute hip fracture (n=20) and the first reoperation was about 300 days (range: 2 weeks to 82 months). Among the women reoperated on, the excess mortality was lower than among those undergoing a single operation. The median costs of treatment per patient with one or more reoperations were (sic)13,422 in hospital A (range: (sic)1616-(sic)61,755), (sic)11,076 in hospital B (range: (sic)1540-(sic)17,866), and (sic)12,850 in the total study group (p=0.43). In the case of infections (3 patients), the mean costs per patient were (sic)28,751 (range: (sic)11,076-(sic)61,755). Conclusions: Almost 10% of hip fracture patients required reoperations, and these reoperations caused significant direct costs to health care. However, direct costs account for only approximately 25% of the first year's total costs. These costs should be taken into account when evaluating the economics of hip fractures and the burden of health care.

Radioactive particles released from different sources in the Semipalatinsk Test Site	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY			English	Article						Nuclear tests; Radioactive particle characterization; SR-mu-XRF/XRD; Particle size; Mobility	FLUORESCENCE; FALLOUT; SAMPLES	A total of 456 nuclear tests were performed from 1949 to 1989 at the Semipalatinsk Test Site (STS) in Kazakhstan, as part of the nuclear weapon test program of the USSR. To identify if radionuclides such as Cs-137, Sr-90, Am-241, P239+240 were associated with radioactive particles, soil samples were collected at selected contaminated sites (i.e. Experimental field, Excavation sites, Fallout plume sections, Background global fallout area, and Degelen Mountain) within the STS. A series of techniques have been applied to identify the size distributions of radionuclides, the prevalence of radioactive particles in soils, and the degree of leachability of particle associated radionuclides by different agents. In addition, selected particles were characterized nondestructively using digital autoradiography, environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and synchrotron radiation microscopic X-ray techniques. Radioactive particles were identified at all sites; large vitrified particles were identified at epicenters, and the size of particles decreased along the plume with distance from the epicenters. The radioactive particles identified varied in composition, size and leachability. In general,(CS)-C- 137, (241)m, Pu239+240 were strongly associated with solid phases (90-99%) in soils, while Sr-90 exhibited much greater variability. The fraction of Sr-90 present in exchangeable forms was low close to epicenters, while the extractability increased along the plume as the particle size distribution decreased. The results suggest that at least four different types of radioactive particles are present at STS: 1) Relatively large spherical particles with a shiny glazed, melted surface with internal porous structure, and surface layers enriched in transuranic elements, identified at epicenters of detonations, 2) Vitrified irregular particles probably originating from debris of nuclear device with interactions from soil components, also identified at epicenters of detonations, 3) Particles with visually unchanged structure, containing micro-inclusions of fissile materials associated with soil components, also identified at epicenters; 4) Particles with amorphous structures associated with underground detonations, identified in soil in the vicinity of the entrance of the detonation tunnels at the Degelen Mountain. These were probably formed by secondary mechanisms due to sorption and fixation of radionuclides. Thus, the present work shows that the STS should be considered an important observatory site to link particle characteristics to specific sources and to release conditions as well as to ecosystem transfer of particle associated radionuclides.

Proximal humerus fractures:: a comparative biomechanical analysis of intra and extramedullary implants	ARCHIVES OF ORTHOPAEDIC AND TRAUMA SURGERY			English	Article						proximal humerus fractures; biomechanical analysis; proximal humeral nail	INTERNAL-FIXATION; SHAFT FRACTURES; HEAD FRACTURES; INTRAMEDULLARY	Introduction The biomechanical stability of a newly developed humerus nail (Sirus (TM)) for the treatment of fractures of the proximal humerus was analyzed in comparison to established systems. In total, three randomized groups were formed (n = 4 pairs) from 12 matched pairs of human cadaver humeri. Materials and methods All intact bones were mechanically characterized by five subsequent load cycles under bending and torsional loading. The bending moment at the osteotomy was 7.5 N m the torsional moment was 8.3 N m over the hole specimen length. Loading was consistently initiated at the distal epiphysis and the deformation at the distal epiphysis was continuously recorded. Prior to implant reinforcement, a defect of 5 mm was created to simulate an unstable subcapital humerus fracture. For paired comparison, one humerus of each pair was stabilized with the Sirus proximal humerus nail while the counterpart was stabilized by a reference implant. In detail, the following groups were created: Sirus versus Proximal humerus nail (PHN) with spiral blade (group I); Sirus versus PHILOS plate (group II); Sirus versus 4.5 mm AO T-plate (group III). Results The Sirus nail demonstrated significantly higher stiffness values compared to the reference implants for both bending and torsional loading. The following distal epiphyseal displacements were recorded for a bending moment of 7.5 N m at the osteotomy: Sirus I: 8.8 mm, II: 8.4 mm, III: 7.7 mm (range 6.9-10.9), PHN 21.1 mm (range 15.7-25.2) (P = 0.005), PHILOS plate 27.5 mm (range 21.6-35.8) (P < 0.001), 4.5 AO T-plate 26.3 mm (range 24.3-33.9) (P = 0.01). The rotations corresponding to 8.3 N m torsional moment were: Sirus I: 9.1 degrees, II: 9.3 degrees, III: 10.6 degrees (range 7.5-12.2), PHN 13.5 degrees (range 10.3-15.6) (P = 0.158), PHILOS plate 15.6 degrees (range 13.7-20.8) (P = 0.007), 4.5 AO T-Platte 14.1 degrees (range 11.5-19.7) (P = 0.158). Conclusion The intramedullary load carriers were biomechanically superior when compared to the plating systems in the fracture model presented here. Supplementary, the Sirus Nail showed higher stiffness values than the PHN. However, the latter are gaining in importance due to the possibility of minimal invasive implantation. Whether this will be associated with functional advantages requires further clinical investigation.

Materials and Methods: A total of 32 patients who underwent mandibular setback using the BSSRO of the mandible to manage skeletal prognathism during the years 2018 to 2020 at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Pusan National University were followed both clinically and with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) for at least one year. Those who were also treated with genioplasty or other orthognathic surgery were excluded from the study. The mandibular angle (gonial angle: Ar-Go-Me), intergonial width (Go-Go), and total angle (sum of left and right proximal segmental angle) were recorded. Changes in the ramus were compared and analyzed before surgery (T1), immediately after surgery (T2), and one year following surgery (T3). Results: The mandibular angle increased by an average of 0.14 degrees immediately after surgery (T2-T1) and increased by 0.97 degrees at 12 months postoperatively (T3-T2). No correlation was observed with the amount of change in each group relative to the amount of mandibular setback. The mandibular width decreased by 0.01 mm on average immediately after surgery (T2-T1), and by 4.2 mm on average at 12 months after surgery (T3-T2). The angle of the mesial fragment of the mandible increased by 1.04 degrees immediately after surgery (T2-T1), compared to the preoperative state. It decreased by 0.86 degrees at 12 months postoperatively (T3-T2). Conclusion: The increase in the mandibular angle from immediately after surgery to 12 months after BSSRO reflects the counterclockwise rotational tendency to prevent opening restriction when intentionally selecting the condylar position. The decrease in the intergonial width immediately after surgery is thought to be due to the effect of internal trimming to minimize the bone interference between the outer surface of the distal bone fragment and the inner surface of the mesial fragment, and the decrease 1 year after surgery can be considered to be due to bone remodeling. Interosseous interference during mandibular setback osteotomy does not necessarily cause an increase in the width of the mandibular angle after surgery.

Those of the human liver flukes, Opisthorchis viverrini, hatch within the gastrointestinal canal of their snail hosts. While adult parasites are primarily responsible for the pathology in cases of human opisthorchiasis, their eggs also contribute by inducing granulomata and in serving as nidi for gallstone formation. In view of the peculiar biology of O. viverrini eggs and their contribution to pathology, we investigated embryogenesis in this species by light and transmission electron microscopy. Egg development was traced from earliest stages of coalescence in the ootype until full embryonation in the distal region of the uterus. Fully mature eggs were generally impermeable to resin and could not be examined by conventional electron microscopy methods. However, the use of high-pressure freezing and freeze-substitution fixation of previously fixed eggs enabled the internal structure of mature eggs, particularly the subshell envelopes, to be elucidated. Fertilization occurs in the ootype, and the large zygote is seen therein with a single spermatozoon wrapped around its plasma membrane. As the zygote begins to divide, the spent vitellocytes are pushed to the periphery of the eggs, where they progressively degrade. The early eggshell is formed in the ootype by coalescing eggshell precursor material released by approximately six vitelline cells. The early eggs have a thinner eggshell and are larger than, but lack the characteristic shape of, mature eggs. Characteristic shell ornamentation, the "muskmelon" appearance of eggs, appears after eggshell polymerization in the ootype. Pores are not present in the shell of O. viverrini eggs. The inner and outer envelopes are poorly formed in this species, with the outer envelope evident beneath the eggshell at the opercular pole of the mature egg. The miracidium has a conical anterior end that lacks the distinctive lamellar appearance of the terebratorium of other digeneans, such as the schistosomes. The miracidium is richly glandular, containing an apical gland in the anterior end, large cephalic gland, and posterior secretory glands. Each gland contains a secretory product with different structure. The paucity of vitelline cells associating with eggs, the reduced size of eggs, and reduced complexity of the extraembryonic envelopes are interpreted as adaptations to the peculiar hatching biology of the miracidia.

Mentoring can bring the surgeon to level 3. Simple experience rarely allows achievement of level 5, in contrast to deliberate practice, in which performance skills are improved by setting learning goals based on feedback about the trainee's previous performance. Hypothesis: When learning a technique for the internal fixation of distal radius fractures, the level of performance skills achieved is higher with deliberate practice than with mentoring or simple experience. Material and methods: Four surgeons each performed minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) of 15 distal radius fractures. The procedures were recorded by an HD camera. The first five fractures (step 1) were treated after mentoring, the next 5 fractures after reading an article and viewing a reference video (step 2), and the last 5 fractures after viewing and commenting 20 short videos highlighting possible errors (step 3). Each recording of the procedures performed by the surgeons was scored using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS, 10 items on basic skills [B] and 10 on MIPO-specific skills [S]). Results: For the basic skills, the mean OSATS scores (on 50) were 31 for step 1, 31 for step 2, and 43 for step 3. For the specific skills, the mean OSATS scores (on 50) were 25 for step 1, 29 for step 2, and 48 for step 3. For overall skills (B + S), the mean OSATS score (on 100) was 56 for step 1, 60 for step 2, and 91 for step 3. Discussion: Our study confirms that the deliberate practice teaching method is more efficient in improving surgeon skills than simple experience. Deliberate practice consists of four essential steps: (i) setting a well-defined goal; (ii) being motivated to improve one's performance; (iii) receiving immediate feedback; and (iv) having multiple opportunities to repeat and gradually perfect one's performance. Our main hypothesis was verified, since the results of learning a MIPO technique, as assessed using the OSATS scale, were significantly better with a video-assisted deliberate practice technique than with mentoring or simple experience. Conclusion: Video-assisted deliberate practice deserves to be widely used in order to optimise learning curves and to improve risk management in surgery. Level of evidence: III.

Materials and Methods In this monocentric study, safety and efficacy of conventional 2D-fluoroscopic-guided iliosacral screw insertion were evaluated. Results During a 10-year period (2005-2014), 98 patients between the age of 18 and 65 years received 207 iliosacral screws in 101 procedures. Average patient age was 43.2 years. There were 46 Type B and 40 Type C injuries in the AO/OTA classification, nine patients had a fragility fracture of the pelvis. In three patients, primary radiological data were missing. The indication for surgical treatment was a sacral fracture in 97 patients, a pure iliosacral dislocation in 37 patients and a fracture-dislocation in 31 patients. 70 procedures were performed with the patient in supine position, 31 with the patient in prone position. Surgery was done in a minimal-invasive technique in 76 patients, in 22 patients an open reduction was necessary before screw insertion. 81 patients received a unilateral, 17 patients a bilateral screw osteosynthesis. 199 screws were inserted in S1, only eight screws in S2. 65 patients received two screws unilaterally, ten patients two screws bilaterally. There were no vascular or neurologic complications. During in-hospital stay, there were seven complications, which needed 12 operative revisions: three wound infections, two hematomas, one screw malalignment and one early screw loosening. In 28 patients with 56 iliosacral screws, a pelvic CT-scan was performed during follow-up. A penetration of a cortical layer was diagnosed in 20 of these screws. All penetrations were seen in double screw osteosynthesis of S1. In none of the patients, complaints could be explained by the malalignment of these screws. Five operative revisions were performed during follow-up: two for screw loosening, two for fracture healing problems and one for screw malalignment. Metal removal was performed in 39 patients with 75 screws. 2D-fluoroscopic-guided iliosacral screw osteosynthesis is a safe and efficient procedure in clinical practice. Discussion A thorough preoperative evaluation of the morphology of the upper sacrum and careful operative procedure are indispensable. Fluoroscopic views in AP, lateral, inlet and outlet must allow recognition of all anatomical landmarks. The indication for double screw osteosynthesis in S1 should be taken with caution. Screw malalignments do not inevitably correlate with complaints.

For older patients with inferior bone quality, it has not been investigated whether the application of an intramedullary force carrier, as a minimally invasive and rapid intervention, can provide a considerable benefit and reduce the postoperative complication and lethality rate. This retrospective study aimed to investigate the stability and functionality after the acute treatment of a femoral neck fracture in osteoporotic bone using an intramedullary force carrier even with higher grade fracture types. Material and Methods The retrospective analysis was based on a collective of 82 patients over 60 years of age with a femoral neck fracture treated with a gliding nail in our centre between 1999 and 2006. Results The average time to follow-up was 69.05 months (median 71.0; minimum 27.0-maximum 108.0). Female patients made up more than two-thirds of the patient collective at 63 of the 82 patients (76.83%). The average age of the patients was 77.76 years (median 78.00; range 60.00-93.00). In 66 patients (80.49%), the implantation showed good results and no complications or further treatments. 24/82 patients of our collective had died in our re-evaluation. In no case, a pseudarthrosis or severe impaction with neck shortening occurred (loss of offset). 11/82 patients had femoral head necrosis which led to total hip replacement in 8 cases, a hemiarthroplasty in 2 cases and in 1 case a remaining Girdlestone situation because of a deep infection. Another five patients also had to undergo a total hip replacement because of a central perforation of the blade in one case, breakout of the blade after another fall in another two cases and a lateral dislocation of the blade in two cases. Conclusion The use of an intramedullary force carrier in the osteoporotic bone can mean distinct advantages for the selected patient as a minimally invasive and rapid surgical method compared to extensive surgery, even in the case of severe injuries. However, the advantages and disadvantages for the patient should be considered critically.

Even though initially this species was regarded with a strict economic interest, in the last period, chinchillas have become an increasingly-encountered patient in veterinary clinics and hospitals. Another aspect is the use of the species in medical research, as experimental model or in parasitology. The present study tackles a combined anatomical and radiological (angiographical) study to accurately describe the vascular anatomy of the initial part of the aortic arch (Arcus aortae). Materials, Methods & Results: The anatomical distribution of collaterals detached from arcus aorticus (brachiocephalic trunk and subclavian arteries) are highlighted in this paper. To do that, the classical stratigraphic anatomical investigation, followed by the radiological study with the help of the contrast substance injected into the vascular bed were used in combination. Several Chinchilla lanigera female carcasses, obtained from a private commercial farming unit in Cluj county, Romania were used for this study. Ten carcasses were used for the anatomical study, being injected into the vascular bed with a mixture of latex and acrylic dye, fixated into formaldehyde 5% and later dissected, while the other ten carcasses were injected at the level of the aortic arch with Visipaque 320 contrast substance and subjected to the angiographical procedure.The anatomical investigation was carried after an initial 5 day-fixation period, while the angiographic procedure was initiated using the TEMCO Grx-01 device and the Veterinary Digital Imaging System (R) as digital imaging processing software. This combined study shows the differential mode of emergence of the subclavian and carotid arteries in this species. The brachiocephalic trunk is the first large collateral branch arising from the initial part of the aortic cross while the left subclavian artery, in all studied cases, stems from this initial part of the aortic arch. The right subclavian artery arises from the terminal part of the brachiocephalic trunk, at the cranial border of the first rib. The continuation of the trunk is represented by right common carotid artery that follows the right jugular groove. The left common carotid artery emerges at the medial aspect of the first intercostal space as a collateral branch detached from the brachiocephalic trunk, in its initial sector. In respect to the collaterals emerging from the subclavian arteries, our study showed that in all studied cases, four branches arise in sequence- the internal thoracic, dorsal scapular, vertebral and superficial cervical arteries. The existence of the common trunks (internal thoracic, dorsal scapular arteries and superficial and deep cervical arteries (as described by other authors) was not confirmed on the investigated specimens. Discussion: The paper highlights some interesting facts referring to the specific morphology of the aortic arch in chinchilla, as literature data provides some divergent data. Some of the aspects noted are confirmed (the emergence of subclavian arteries) while some others are still subjects to discussion and further investigation (collateral branches of subclavian arteries). Our approach focuses also on the comparative aspects of the morphology of the branches emerging from the aortic arch. According to the available literature, the following species were used as comparison: leporids, Guinea pig, squirrel, yellow-necked mouse, Egyptian mouse, rat, armadillo, nutria, capybara, paca, fox and leopard.

J	Collinge, C; Coons, D; Aschenbrenner, J				Collinge, C; Coons, D; Aschenbrenner, J			Risks to the superior gluteal neurovascular bundle during percutaneous iliosacral screw insertion - An anatomical cadaver study	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC TRAUMA			English	Article						superior gluteal neurovascular bundle; percutaneous iliosacral screw insertion; pelvic injury	PELVIC RING DISRUPTIONS; INTERNAL-FIXATION; LATERAL APPROACH; SAFE PLACEMENT; INJURIES; NERVE; FRACTURE; HIP	Background: Iliosacral screws are a popular technique used to treat complicated injuries of the pelvis. It is well recognized that this technique entails some potentially disabling complications, including damage to vessels and lumbosacral nerves. The recommended insertion site for iliosacral screws into the S1 body lies along the posterior ilium between the greater sciatic notch and the iliac crest. The anatomy and course of the superior gluteal nerve and vessels have been described along the outer aspect of the posterior ilium. Injury to the superior gluteal nerve and vessels has been reported during pelvic surgery, including the insertion of iliosacral screws. The purpose of this study is to assess the risks of injury and proximity of percutaneously inserted iliosacral screws to the superior gluteal nerve and vessels using a cadaver model. Materials and Methods: Twenty-nine cadaver pelvises for a total of 58 sides (58 screws) were studied. Percutaneous iliosacral screws were placed into the first sacral bodies using multiplanar fluoroscopic guidance. The superior gluteal neurovascular bundle was then studied via a posterior dissection. Injury to the neurovascular bundle was noted if it occurred, and the distance between the screw head and the neurovascular bundle was measured. Distances from the screw head to the crista glutea, greater sciatic notch, and iliac crest were also measured. Results: The branching pattern of the superior gluteal nerve and vessels after they exit the greater sciatic notch demonstrated considerable variation, but was generally consistent with prior descriptions in most cases. Ten of 58 (18%) iliosacral screws caused injury to the superior branch of the superior gluteal nerve and vessels; 8 neurovascular bundles were impaled and 2 others were partly entrapped between the screw head and the ilium. The mean distance from the head of the iliosacral screws to the deep superior branches of the superior gluteal nerve and vessels was 9.1 mm (+/- 6.8 mm). The mean distances from the screw head to the crista glutea, sciatic notch, and iliac crest were 19.5 mm (+/- 4.9 mm), 33.0 mm (+/- 6.4 mm) and 50.3 mm (+/- 4.6 mm). Of the screws that caused superior gluteal nerve and vessels injury, all were within the "desired" area of insertion. Conclusions: The deep superior branch of the superior glutcal nerve and vessels, which provides major blood and nerve supply to the G. medius and G. minimus, is at significant risk during the percutaneous placement of iliosacral screws even when "well placed" and soft tissue protecting cannulas are used. The clinical effects of these injuries remain poorly understood.

Delta III reverse shoulder arthroplasty: Radiological outcome for acute complex fractures of the proximal humerus in elderly patients	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Radiological outcome; Reverse shoulder prosthesis; Proximal humerus fracture	FOLLOW-UP; PROSTHESIS; CUFF; RUPTURE	Purpose of the study: Acute complex proximal humerus fractures in the elderly population, treated by internal fixation or hemiarthroplasty, give well reported radiological results. We investigated the radiological outcome of the reverse arthroplasty concept in this indication. Material and methods: From 1993 to 2007, 41 Delta III prostheses were implanted following 32 three-part and four-part displaced fractures, and in nine fracture/dislocations; three fractured patients were males and 38 females; mean age at fracture time was 75 years. The results were evaluated on AP and Lamy lateral shoulder views. Results: Since nine of these patients were deceased and two had moved, 30 cases were available at review, with a mean follow-up of 6.5 years (range, 1-14). The radiographs showed two thick radiolucent lines on the glenoid component with one aseptic loosening of the base plate at 12 years. Based on the Nerot classification, 17 cases of inferior scapular notching were, in total, observed. The mean time to onset was 2 years for the seven grade 1 notches (41%), 4 years for the five grade 2 notches (30%), 5 years for the three grade 3 notches (17%) and 6 years for the two grade 4 notches (12%). Fourteen inferior spurs (stable after emergence) were reported with a mean time to onset of 2.5 years (range, 1-6 years). One joint ossification occurred at 6 months and was stable at the 6-year follow-up review. The humeral component results comprised four cases of medial (5, 6, 7 and 10 years) proximal bone loss and two cases of bone-cement interface deterioration (medial radiolucent lines at two-third of the stem height at the 5-year follow-up). In these six cases, a notch was present above this area. In addition, one case of humeral septic loosening is reported at 2-year follow-up. Conclusion: For acute proximal humeral complex fractures in the elderly population, when refixation of the tuberosities on a classical orthopaedic devices appears compromised, the use of a Delta III reverse prosthesis is an attractive alternative; however, with a mean follow-up of 6.5 years, this prosthesis demonstrates unsatisfactory images in 70% of the cases. These flaws were progressive in 50% of the cases. However, only one revision was required for an aseptic loosening of the base plate at 12 years. New developments in designs and bearing surfaces and larger numbers analysis of long-term results will probably be needed to encourage extensive utilization of the reverse concept in this fracture indication.

CL was classified into three types: type S: leakage via segmental veins; type B: leakage via basivertebral veins; and type I: leakage via pedicle screw instrumentation to paravertebral soft tissue. The age, gender, operation stage (primary or later stage), body mass index, bone mineral density, the number and type of augmented screw, the position of the tip of screw (lateral or internal part of vertebral body), the position of screw (left or right side), the volume of bone cement, location of the augmented vertebra (lumbar or sacrum), the type of CL and complications were recorded. Binary logistic regression correlation was used to analyze risk factors of veins leakage (type S and type B).ResultsThe CL was observed in 165 patients (81.68%) and 335 screws (35.26%), leakage types of S, B and I were seen in 255 (76.12%), 77 (22.99%), and 30 (8.96%) of screws, respectively. Besides, double or multiple routes of leakage were seen in 27 screws. Number of augmented screw was a risk factor for vein leakage (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.44-0.77; P=0.000). Furthermore, the doses of cement (OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.61-0.99; P=0.038) and the position of screw (OR 0.39; 95% CI 0.29-0.53; P=0.000) were identified as risk factors for type S, and the doses of bone cement (OR 0.37; 95% CI 0.25-0.54; P=0.000) and the position of the tip of screw (OR 0.07; 95% CI 0.04-0.13; P=0.000) were risk factors for type B.ConclusionsCAPSI bears a high risk of asymptomatic CL, with a higher rate of leakage into segmental veins and basivertebral veins. As is known, more augmented screws and larger doses of cement are risk factors for veins leakage (type S and type B), while the tip of screw approaching to the midline of the vertebral body is another risk factor to type B. Thus, the CL could be reduced by the amelioration of operative techniques and procedures.Graphical abstractThese slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material. [GRAPHICS] .

Screw insertion and reinsertion within the same hole in the bone may occur during surgery. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the pullout strength of 3.5-mm self-tapping screws with up to 5 re-insertions in the diaphysis of the tibia, metaphysis of the distal tibia, calcaneus, and a polyurethane synthetic bone model. Methods: Screws were inserted into a synthetic bone model and 5 pairs of human cadaveric diaphyseal tibiae, distal tibiae, and calcanei. The bone was predrilled, and then 3.5-mm cortical self-tapping 316 L stainless steel screws with a washer were inserted bicortically. Screws were inserted from 1 to 5 times at each location. The screws were grasped and subjected to 5-mm/min tensional force via the biaxial material testing systems machine. Statistical significance was determined using a paired 2-tailed t test. Results: There was a significant difference in the pullout strength of the tibial diaphysis (1710 +/- 550 N), tibial metaphysis (471 +/- 266 N), and calcaneus (238 +/- 90 N; P < 0.01). The tibial diaphysis pullout strength was 1710 +/- 550 N for one insertion differing significantly relative to the groups with 4 (average 1030 +/- 543 N, P = 0.004) or 5 (average 364 +/- 209 N, P < 0.001) insertions. The tibial metaphyseal pullout strength for the single insertion group was 471 +/- 266 N and differed significantly relative to the 3 (P = 0.026), 4 (P = 0.044), and 5 (P = 0.042) insertion groups. The calcaneal pullout strength for the single insertion group was 238 +/- 90 N with a significant difference of the 1, 3, and 4, versus the 5 insertion group (P = 0.027, 0.040, and 0.033, respectively). The synthetic bone model pullout strength decreased significantly from the one insertion group relative to all other insertion groups (group 1, 1167 +/- 263 N; group 2, 768 +/- 199 N; group 3, 694 +/- 295 N; group 4, 662 +/- 356 N; and group 5, 154 +/- 183 N; P < 0.02). Conclusions: There is a significant decrease in relative pullout strength of 3.5-mm self-tapping cortical screws when comparing the tibial diaphysis, tibial metaphysis, and calcaneus. There is also a significant decrease in 3.5-mm self-tapping screw pullout strength after repeated re-insertions in the synthetic bone model, mid-shaft tibia, metaphyseal tibia, and calcaneus. We recommend that during osteosynthesis, careful screw insertion, and minimal reinsertion be performed.

Background parameters, fracture type and reduction of the fracture did not differ significantly between the groups. Fifty-seven percent of the patients were operated on within 6 h of admission to hospital, 74% within 12 h and 92% within 24 h. The mean (median) time for operation was 36 (30) min for the hook-pins and 40 (35) min for the AO-screws. The devices were significantly better positioned in the hook-pin group (81% of cases good) compared to the AO-screws (66% good) (p = 0.04). In all, 72% of the patients had no deficiency either in reduction of the fracture, positioning of the implants or had drill penetration of the femoral head. Direct unrestricted weight bearing was encouraged in 92% of the hook-pin and 90% of the AO-screws group. The mean (median) hospital time was 13 (10) days with no significant difference between the groups. Following treatment, 5% walked without aids, 76% of the patients walked with some aids, and 16% could not walk. The walking ability was not known for 4%. At four months, 59% of the patients were living in their own home (64% before fracture), 18% (25% before) in a nursing home, 5% (11% before) in other accommodation and 18% were dead. After two years, 77% of the hook-pin patients had not needed any re-operation compared to 73% in the AO-screw group. In total a secondary hemi-arthroplasty had been performed in 7% and total hip arthroplasty in 12% of the patients. Extraction only of osteosynthesis material had been performed in 5%. The difference in the reoperation rates between the two methods was not significant. In the undisplaced fractures, 84% of the patients had not: needed any reoperation after two years compared to 70% among the displaced fractures. Major reoperation had been performed in 10% (1% hemi and 9% total hip arthroplasty) in the patients with undisplaced fractures compared to 26% in those with displaced fractures (10% hemi, 16% total hip arthroplasty and 1% Girdlestone operation). The remaining patients had only undergone removal of metalwork. Osteosynthesis thus proved to be a successful operation in many of the patients with displaced fractures. A preoperative, prognostic-based selection between osteosynthesis and arthroplasty is the future goal for optimised femoral neck fracture treatment. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It seems well indicated in frail and/or dependent patients with comorbidities, but this has not been specifically assessed, and failure is frequent in this target population. We therefore performed a retrospective study to: (1) assess results of functional treatment for Garden-1 impacted femoral neck fracture in dependent patients, and (2) analyze survival in terms of complications and death, and related factors. Hypothesis: Functional treatment for Garden-1 fracture in dependent patients gives poor results, with a high rate of surgical revision. Material and methods: A retrospective analysis was made of Garden-1 femoral neck fracture in dependent patients (Parker score <= 5), with a minimum 2 years' follow-up. One hundred and forty-six patients were included: mean age, 81.3 +/- 8.7 years (range, 55.7-99.6 years). The endpoint was survival in terms of complications requiring surgery, secondary displacement requiring surgery, excessive pain requiring surgery, non-union or femoral head osteonecrosis. Secondary endpoints were overall mortality and mortality related to complications. Results: Mean follow-up was 4.2 +/- 2.6 years (range, 2.0-10.3 years ). Ninety-one of the 146 patients ( 62.3%) required secondary surgery: 79 (54.1%) early (<3 months post-fracture), with 77 (52.7%) secondary displacements and 2 cases (1.4%) of excessive pain; and 12 (8.2%) late (162.2 +/- 132.3 days; range, 90-454 days), with 8 (5.4%) non-unions and 4 (2.7%) osteonecroses. Mean time to onset of secondary displacement was 13.6 +/- 11.8 days (range, 0-67.0 days). Two-year survival in terms of revision surgery was 34.1% [95% CI: 26.0-42.4]. At last follow-up, 91 patients (62.3%) had died; 2-year survival in terms of death was 69.9% [95% CI: 62.4-77.3]. Survival analysis in terms of complications revealed greater mortality in absence of complications: 42 of the 55 patients (76.3%) without complications requiring surgery died, versus 49 of the 91 (53.8%) with complications requiring surgery (p= 0.012); relative risk of death in absence of complications requiring surgery was 1.42 [95% CI: 1.33-5.77]. Discussion: Functional treatment for Garden-1 fracture in dependent patients gave poor short- and medium-term results. Surgery is therefore recommended in this specific population; the present findings should improve survival. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Material and methods: Between June 2008 and May 2012, a total of 68 patients with extra-articular distal humeral shaft fractures were treated by lateral and posterior approaches. Of the patients, 30 were operated by a lateral approach (group I) and 26 patients were operated by a posterior approach (group II). There was no statistical significance between the two groups in sex distribution, age, the mechanism of the injury, injured arms, AO/ASIF (Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen/Association for the Study of Internal Fixation) classification, and the time from injury to surgery (P > 0.05). Operation time, intraoperative bleeding volume, hospitalisation, clinical outcomes, and complications were compared between the two groups. The elbow functional results were evaluated by the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS). Results: All patients were followed up. The average of follow-up in group I was 15.53 +/- 2.636 months (range, 12-22 months), and was 16.12 +/- 2.889 months (range, 12-22 months) in group II. There was no significant difference in the operation time, intraoperative bleeding time, and hospitalisation between the two groups (P > 0.05). In group I, the mean time of bone union was 12.87 +/- 1.852 weeks (range, 10-16 weeks), the mean degrees of elbow flexion was 139.20 degrees +/- 3.274 degrees (range, 134-146 degrees), the mean degrees of elbow extension was 4.77 degrees +/- 1.906 degrees (range, 0-8 degrees), and the mean points of MEPS was 87.00 +/- 7.724 (range, 70-100 points). In group II, the mean time of bone union was 12.96 +/- 2.218 weeks (range, 10-16 weeks), the mean degrees of elbow flexion was 137.85 degrees +/- 4.076 degrees (range, 130-145 degrees), the mean degrees of elbow extension was 5.158 +/- 2.327 degrees(range, 0-9 degrees), and the mean points of MEPS was 86.15 +/- 7.656 (range, 70-100 points). There was no significant difference in the bone union, range of elbow flexion, range of elbow extension and MEPS between the two groups (P > 0.05). The overall complication rate in group I was lower than that in group II (P = 0.041). Conclusions: Both lateral and posterior surgical approaches acquired satisfied treatment results in the management of extra-articular distal humeral shaft fractures, and there was a lower complication rate using the lateral approach.

We used arthroscopy to evaluate the outcomes after surgery to repair intercondylar eminence fractures. Materials and methods Ten patients (8 men and 2 women; average age at the time of surgery 27.9 +/- 10.0 years, range from 14 to 50 years) with fracture of the tibial intercondylar eminence underwent an arthroscopic reduction and internal fixation with non-absorbable sutures. Preoperative radiological examination showed that there were one Meyer's type-II, eight type-IIIA and one type-IIIB fractures. Clinical symptoms and physical findings for all the patients were evaluated 1 year postoperatively. Radiographic assessment and the Lysholm rating scale were also utilized. Second-look arthroscopy was performed after 1 year when removing the implant. Arthroscopy was used to assess the appearance of the surface of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), check for the existence of cyclops and look for interposition of tissue in the lateral and medial joint spaces. Results One year after the surgery, all ten patients achieved bony union and had negative Lachman and anterior drawer tests. The average Lysholm knee score was 94.5 +/- 7.2 points (range 100-75 points). Arthroscopy showed an irregular surface on the ACL in two of the ten patients, cyclops in two patients, interposition in the lateral joint space in two patients and interposition in the medial joint space in one patient. In the two cases seen with an irregular surface, the ACL was covered with droopy fibrous tissue, but the substance of the ACL was intact. The two patients who had cyclops showed loss of knee extension (5 degrees similar to 10 degrees), which was regained by subsequent resection of the cyclops. One patient who had an interposition into the lateral joint space complained of catching, which was released by resection of the interposing tissue. Conclusion Arthroscopic refixation of the intercondylar eminence fracture provided bony union and a good clinical outcome. Cyclops syndrome is one of the causes of loss of knee extension, and soft tissue in the medial or lateral compartment is one of the causes of catching of knee after surgical repair of intercondylar eminence fracture. Cyclops syndrome, which may occur following ACL reconstruction, is one of the causes of loss of knee extension after surgical repair of intercondylar eminence fracture. In patients who have knee complaints, such as catching and loss of knee extension, a second-look arthroscopy is useful for identifying and correcting the problem.

A retrospective matched cohort study. Objective. To comprehensively compare the 2-year postoperative results of posterior correction and fusion with segmental pedicle screw instrumentation versus with hybrid (proximal hooks and distal pedicle screws) constructs in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) treated at a single institution. Summary of Background Data. Despite the reports of satisfactory correction and maintenance of scoliotic curves by pedicle screw instrumentation, there have been no reports on the comprehensive comparison of AIS treatment after segmental pedicle screw instrumentation versus hybrid instrumentation. Materials and Methods. A total of 58 AIS patients that underwent posterior fusion with hybrid instrumentation (29) or pedicle screw (29) instrumentation at a single institution were sorted and matched according to four criteria: similar patient age, fusion levels, identical Lenke curve type, and identical operative methods. Patients were compared at 2-year follow-up according to radiographic changes, operative time, intraoperative blood loss, pulmonary function tests, and SRS-24 outcome scores. Results. The two cohorts were well matched. The pre-operative major Cobb angle averaged 62 degrees in the screw group and 60 degrees in the hybrid group. Average major curve correction was 70% in the screw group and 56% in the hybrid group (P = 0.001). At 2-year follow-up, major curve correction was 65% and 46%, respectively (P < 0.001). At 2-year follow-up, thoracic sagittal Cobb angle changes between T5 and T12 were 9.0 degrees decrease in the screw group and 2.4 degrees decrease in the hybrid group compared with preoperative (P = 0.024). There were no differences in the lowest instrumented vertebra below the lower end vertebra (P = 0.56), operative time (P = 0.14), and average estimated blood loss (P = 0.54). Two years following surgery, the screw group demonstrated improved percent predicted pulmonary function values compared with that of the hybrid group (FVC; 81% -> 81% in screw group vs. 85% -> 79% in hybrid group P = 0.08, FEV1; 73% -> 79% in screw group vs. 79% -> 75% in hybrid group, P = 0.006). Postoperative total SRS-24 scores were similar in both groups (hybrid group: 99 vs. screw group: 95) (P = 0.19). There were no neurologic complications related to hybrid or pedicle screw instrumentation. Conclusion. Pedicle screw instrumentation offers a significantly better major curve correction and postoperative pulmonary function values without neurologic problems compared with hybrid constructs. Both instrumentation methods offer similar junctional change, lowest instrumented vertebra, operative time, and postoperative SRS-24 outcome scores in the operative treatment of AIS.

Locking plate versus nonsurgical treatment for proximal humeral fractures: better midterm outcome with nonsurgical treatment	JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY			English	Article						Proximal humeral fracture; locking-plate; nonsurgical treatment; active range of motion; EQ-5D score; ASES score; complication rate	NONOPERATIVE TREATMENT; INTERNAL-FIXATION; EARLY COMPLICATIONS; OPEN REDUCTION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; CLASSIFICATION; MULTICENTER; ARTHROSIS	Background: Since its introduction, there has been controversy about the use of locking plates in the treatment of proximal humeral fractures. Have they really improved the functional outcome after a proximal humeral fracture or should nonsurgical treatment have a more prominent role? In order to evaluate our hypothesis that nonsurgical treatment for proximal humerus fractures should be the first choice of treatment, a matched controlled cohort study was conducted to compare the midterm (>1 year) functional and radiologic outcome of a group of patients treated with a locking plate and a matched group of patients treated nonsurgically. Complications in each group of patients were evaluated. Materials and methods: Through direct matching, 17 patients (1 bilateral fracture) treated with a locking plate were matched to 18 patients treated nonsurgically. Medical records and radiographs were reviewed retrospectively to obtain relevant patient related data and fracture type according to Neer classification (i.e. 2-, 3-and 4-part fractures). At the time of clinical follow-up, EQ-5D, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, visual analog pain (VAS) pain and VAS satisfaction scores were completed. Active range of motion was tested. New radiographs were made to evaluate fracture healing, complications and, in the locking plate group, the position of the plate and screws. Results: No significant differences were found in the characteristics of the patient groups. A significant difference in range of motion was found in favor of the nonsurgically treated patients. Results of ASES and patient satisfaction scores were also tending toward nonsurgical treatment. Furthermore, the complication rate was higher with locking plate treatment. Patients treated with a locking plate needed significantly more additional treatment on their injured shoulder (P = 0.005). Discussion: This study's main limitation was the fact that the choice of initial fracture management was based on clinical judgement, as well as patient's fitness for surgery and therefore not randomized. By matching for fracture type this bias was largely overcome. Surgical treatment had a higher complication rate, requiring more additional treatment, which was often related to the initial surgery. Improving surgical technique could possibly lead to better outcomes for the surgically treated patients. In addition to the more favorable outcomes, nonsurgical treatment is also a more cost effective treatment. Conclusion: Nonsurgical treatment should have a more prominent role in the treatment of proximal humeral fractures. Level of evidence: Level III, Retrospective Case Control Study, Treatment Study.

Results in 401 peripheral and spinal locations	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Bone metastasis; Pathological fracture; Survival; Surgery; Osteophilic cancer	SKELETAL METASTASES; PATIENT SURVIVAL; SURGERY; COMPLICATIONS; FRACTURE	Introduction: Peripheral and spinal bone metastases arise mainly from 5 osteophilic cancers: lung, prostate, kidney, breast and thyroid. Few studies combined results for the two types metastatic location (peripheral and spinal). Therefore we performed a multicenter retrospective study of surgically managed peripheral and spinal bone metastases to assess: (1) global function at a minimum 1 year's follow-up and; (2) factors affecting survival. Hypothesis: Global function is improved by surgery, with acceptable survival.Material and method: Between 2015 and 2016, 386 patients were operated on in 11 centers for 401 metastases: 231 peripheral, and 170 spinal. Mean age was 62.6 +/- 12.5 years in the 212 female patients (54%) versus 66.4 +/- 11.5 years in the 174 males (46%) (p = 0.001). Pre-to postoperative comparison was made on pain on VAS (visual analog scale), WHO (World Health Organization) score, Karnofsky score, walking and global upper-limb function. Survival was estimated at 4 years' follow-up.Results: The most frequent locations were in the femur (n = 146, 36%) and thoracic spine (n = 107, 27%). The primary cancer was revealed by the metastasis in 82 patients (21%). There were 55 general complications (14%) and 48 local complications (12%). Twenty-one patients (5.4%) died during the first month. VAS and Karnofsky sores improved: respectively, 6.6 +/- 2.3 vs. 3.4 +/- 2.1 (p < 0.001) and 65 +/- 14 vs. 72 +/- 20 (p = 0.01). Walking, upper-limb function and Frankel grade improved in respectively 49/86 (57%), 19/29 (66%) and 31/84 (37%) patients. Median survival was 13.3 months (95% CI: 10.8-17.1), and was related to the primary (log-rank, p < 0.001): lung 6.5 months (95% CI: 5.2-8.9), prostate 11.1 months (95% CI: 5.3-43.6), kidney 12.9 months (95% CI: 8.4-22.6), breast 26.5 months (95% CI: 19.0-34.0), and thyroid 49.0 months (95% CI: 12.2-NA). On multivariate analysis, independent factors for death comprised internal fixation rather than prosthesis (OR = 2.20; 95% CI: 1.59-3.04 (p < 0.001)), high preoperative ASA score (OR = 1.78; 95% CI: 1.40-2.28 (p < 0.001)), preoperative chemotherapy (OR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.13-1.41 (p < 0.001)) and major visceral metastasis (lung, brain, liver) (OR = 11.80; 95% CI: 5.21-26.71 (p < 0.001)). Conclusion: Although function improved only slightly, pain relief and maintained autonomy suggest enhanced comfort in life, confirming the study hypothesis only partially. Factors affecting survival and clinical results argue for preventive surgery when possible, before general health status deteriorates. Level of evidence: IV; retrospective observational.

Patient Selection Criteria for Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty in Displaced Intracapsular Hip Fractures: Are They Appropriate?	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND EMERGENCY SURGERY			English	Article						Intracapsular; Subcapital; Hip fracture; Arthroplasty; Outcome	FEMORAL-NECK FRACTURES; INTERNAL-FIXATION; BIPOLAR HEMIARTHROPLASTY; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; REPLACEMENT; OLDER; REDUCTION; MORTALITY; PEOPLE	Introduction: This study aims to determine, by outcome analysis, the appropriateness of current criteria employed to select patients for total hip arthroplasty (THA) as the primary treatment for displaced intracapsular hip fracture (DICHF). This study is intended to inform prospective randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of THA as a primary treatment. Materials and Methods: Contemporary THA eligibility criteria were derived from recent publications relating to pre-fracture residence, mobility and independence. Outcome data were analysed for 96 patients (19% of 506 consecutive patients with DICHIF between March 2003 and February 2005) who fulfilled those criteria. The variables analysed included age, gender, co-existing injuries, co-morbidities, social circumstances, mobility, independence, delay to surgery, readmission and death. The 96 patients included in the study were followed for 3 years. The primary outcome was the combined achievement of home or warden-assisted accommodation at 3 months, no patient readmission within 6 weeks of discharge and survival to 1 year. Secondary outcome was survival to 3 years. Results: At 3 months, 86 patients (90%) had returned home, three (3.1%) required nursing or residential home placement, four (4.2%) were still resident in a community hospital and three (3.1%) had died. A total of ten patients failed to return to their own home. Eight patients (8.3%) were readmitted within 6 weeks. At 1 year, eight patients (8.3%) had died; by 3 years, the mortality rate was 25%. Patients not achieving return to home were older (84.8 years vs. 79.7 years, p = 0.19), prior to fracture were more likely to use a walking aid (odds ratio [OR] 2.35) or required home support (OR 1.74). The number of co-morbidities was not an association. Backward selection applied to the above data produced an OR Of 1.12 (confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.21) for age as a variable in patients successfully discharged home, so that for each increase in age by year, the odds of home not being the final destination increased by 12%. These factors were also reflected in the patients requiring readmission within 6 weeks from discharge. Conclusions: If maintaining a high level of activity and independence is the expectation in patients considered for THA for DICHFs, then current selection criteria appear to be appropriate in identifying those capable of returning home, remaining independent and surviving to 1 year compared to the whole DICHF population. With a 75% 3-year survival, the postulated benefit of THA will not be realised in many patients and this needs to be considered. Cost-effectiveness trials are required before broad practice change occurs.

MiR-1 40-3p overexpression activates the Wnt signaling pathway to promote fracture healing	EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						MiR-1 40-3p; Wnt signaling pathway; Fracture healing	BONE; HOMEOSTASIS	OBJECTIVE: To study the mechanism of micro ribonucleic acid (miR)-140-3p participating in the regulation of fracture healing in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into five groups, namely, group A [phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)] (n=10), group B (miR-140-3p mimics) (n=10), group C [mimics negative control (NC)] (n=10), group D [antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-miR-140-3p] (n=10), and group E (ASO NC) (n=10). A rat model of fracture was established on all the rats through the operation. From the successful establishment of the model, the rats in group A were intraperitoneally injected with 50 mu L PBS (2 nmol) once a week for 6 weeks, and those in group B, C, D, and E were injected with equivalent volume of miR-140-3p mimics, mimics NC, ASO-miR-140-3p, and ASO NC, respectively, once a week since the successful establishment of model for 6 weeks. The fracture healing in the rats was evaluated via imaging. Meanwhile, Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was applied to detect the expression of miR-140-3p in the five groups. Wnt and beta-catenin expressions in the five groups were detected by means of Western blotting (WB). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and its quantized statistical value in the five groups were detected through immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: The expression of miR-140-3p was stimulated in miR-140-3p mimics group and inhibited in ASO-miR-140-3p group. The detection of the miR-140-3p expression level in the five groups via RT-PCR showed that miR-140-3p mimics group had a remarkably higher miR-140-3p expression than the other four groups. The differences were statistically significant (p<0.05). The WB assay verified that the Wnt and beta-catenin expressions in miR-140-3p mimics group were notably higher than those in control groups, and there were statistically significant differences (p<0.05). Compared with those in the groups injected with PBS. ASO miR-140-3p, mimics NC, and ASO NC, there were evidently more callus tissues, better healed and more blurred fracture lines, as well as no translocation and looseness of internal fixation, in the group injected with miR-140-3p mimics, suggesting that the stimulation of the miR-140-3p expression promotes the fracture healing in the rats. The results of immunohistochemical staining indicated that the number of ALP-positive osteoblasts in the rats in miR-140-3p mimics group was increased markedly in comparison with that in the remaining groups (p<0.05), implying that the differentiation of osteoblasts in the rats was affected in miR-140-3p mimics group. CONCLUSIONS: The overexpressed miR-140-3p in the rats with fracture can promote fracture healing by activating the Wnt signaling pathway.

Methods: The plates and screws (made of titanium alloy and stainless steel materials, according to the latest standard brands) were assessed for displacement in degrees, MRI-related heating and artifacts at a 1.5-T MR system. The displacement in degrees of the plates and screws was evaluated on an angel-measurement instrument at the entrance of the MR scanner. The MRI-related heating was assessed on a swine leg fixed with a plate by using a "worst-case" pulse sequence. A rectangular water phantom was designed to evaluate metallic artifacts of a screw on different sequences (T1/T2-weighted FSE, STIR, T2-FSE fat saturation, GRE, DWI) and then artifacts were evaluated on T2-weighted FSE sequence by modifying the scanning parameters including field of view (FOV), echo train length (ETL) and bandwidth to identify the influence of parameters on metallic artifacts. 15 volunteers with internal vertebral fixation (titanium alloy materials) were scanned with MR using axial and sagittal T2-FSE, sagittal T2-FSE fat suppression and STIR with conventional and optimized parameters, respectively. Then all images were graded by two experienced radiologists having the experience of more than 7 years under double-blind studies that is neither of them knew which was conventional parameter group and optimized parameter group. Results: The average deflection angle of titanium alloy and stainless steel implants were 4.3 and 7.7, respectively, (less than 45) which indicated that the magnetically induced force was less than the weight of the object. The deflection angle of the titanium alloy implants was less than the stainless steel one (t = 9.69, P < 0.001). The average temperature changes of titanium alloy before and after the scan was 0.48 degrees C and stainless steel implants was 0.74 degrees C, respectively, with the background temperature changes of 0.24 degrees C. The water phantom test indicated that the DWI sequence produced largest artifacts, while FSE pulse sequence produced smallest artifacts. And T2-weighted FSE fat saturation sequence produced larger artifacts than STIR sequence. The influence of the scanning parameters on metallic artifacts was verified that metallic artifacts increased with longer echo train length and bigger FOV, while decreased with larger bandwidth. The interreader agreement was good or excellent for each set of images graded with Cohen's Kappa statistic. Image grading of axial and sagittal T2-FSE with optimized parameters were significantly superior to that with conventional parameters (grade, 3.3 +/- 0.5 vs 2.7 +/- 0.6, P = 0.003; 3.2 +/- 0.4 vs 1.9 +/- 0.7, P = 0.001) and image of STIR sequence received a better grade than T2-FSE FS sequence (grade, 3.4 +/- 0.5 vs 1.7 +/- 0.6, < 0.001). Conclusions: The latest standard plates and screws used in orthopedic surgery do not pose an additional hazard or risk to patients undergoing MR imaging at 1.5-T or less. Though artifacts caused by them cannot be ignored because of their relatively large size, it is possible to be minimized by choosing appropriate pulse sequences and optimizing scanning parameters, such as FSE and STIR sequence with large bandwidth, small FOV and appropriate echo train length.

The advantage of using fasciae latae in the tissue reparation is the need of little blood supply, making it a viable option in the restoration of biological functions. The objective of this study was to describe the case of a female poodle, 12-year-old, and with subcutaneous emphysema due to fracture of the nasal bone, submitted to cranioplasty using fasciae latae. Case: It was attended a 12-year-old female poodle due to a traumatic brain injury. At physical examination, the animal had presented facial swelling and respiratory distress with inspiratory effort. Additionally, were verified subcutaneous emphysema and a depression in the nasal plane region with crepitus on palpation. Radiographic examinations revealed nasal bone and maxilla fractures. The animal was submitted to cranioplasty for nasal bone fracture repair. To access the nasal bone and frontal sinus was performed an incision in the dorsal midline from the level of medial orbital rim to the nasal plane. The subcutaneous tissue was divulsioned to allow the exposure of the nasal bone fracture, whose small fragments prevented the internal fixation. The bone defect was then repaired using free autologous fasciae latae of 2 cm wide x 3 cm long, sutured to the periosteum. Subcutaneous emphysema gradually decreased until its resolution at three days postoperatively. The surgical wound had complete healing at 10 days after surgery without concomitant complications. Discussion: The choice of the reconstructive technique is based on the operative planning and the surgeon's experience. In the present case we opted for the autologous fasciae latae graft since its ready availability and lesser predisposition to immunogenic sensibilization and rejection. In addition, we opted for the autologous fasciae latae graft because it is an occlusive material that would prevent the air flow through it during the inspiration and expiration, and consequently the aggravation of the subcutaneous emphysema. In fact, the resolution of the subcutaneous emphysema occurred three days after grafting. Furthermore, the resolution of the subcutaneous emphysema was determined by the lower retraction of the autologous fasciae latae graft due to the scar fibrous tissue deposition. The choice of the reconstructive technique is also based on the viability of the recipient bed, which should provide adequate blood supply for the reception of the free graft. In the present case, however, the bone defect did not provide adequate blood supply and structural support. Due to this, the autologous fasciae latae graft was crucial to the verified results, since it requires less blood supply and structural support to remain the graft viable. We concluded that the autologous fasciae latae graft may be a viable option for the anatomical and functional reconstruction of traumatic lesions localized in the skull, particularly the nasal bone, due to the satisfactory follow-up in the present case without the occurrence of complications. A larger sample size, however, it is necessary to evaluate the real effectiveness of the autologous fasciae latae graft in reconstructive skull surgery on small animals.

Long bones giant cells tumors: Treatment by curretage and cavity filling cementation	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Giant cell tumor; Cement; Curettage; PMMA	CRYOSURGERY; CURETTAGE	Objective: Giant cell tumors (GCT) of bone are benign tumors with local aggressiveness that most of the time occur around the metaphyseal area of long bones, often in contact with the articular cartilage. Their treatment remains controversial because of their high recurrence rate. The authors report a retrospective series of 30 cases treated using curettage followed by cementation. They suggest demonstrating the mechanical and functional benefit of this technique, its benefit controlling the risk of recurrence, and of osteoarthritis potential. Material and Methods: Between 1992 and 2005, 30 patients with GCT were treated using curettage and cementation. Twenty-six of these tumors were present around the knee: 14 at the distal femur and 12 at the proximal tibia. Preoperative radiological evaluation with standard X-rays showed that the tumor measured a mean 71 x 45 mm, for a mean volume of 78 cm(3). Seventy-three percent of these GCT were in direct contact with the articular cartilage and 40% extended to the soft tissues as seen on the CAT scan and/or MRI. All patients were treated with curettage and cementation, 16 additional internal fixation procedures were performed. The mean follow-up of this series was 6 years and 4 months. All patients continue to be monitored, with none lost to follow-up. Results: In all our cases, nine recurrences (30%) were observed during the first 2 years. Six patients were treated with a new curettage and cementation procedure and three underwent a total knee arthroplasty. None of these lesions had recurred at the last follow-up. The MSTS score, reflecting the function of the operated limb was a mean 93.33% (28 +/- 2/30). Standard radiological assessment showed a thin scalable border on four patients and was normal for the all-total arthroplasty cases. Two cases of minor osteoarthritis progression were noted ( one less than 50% and a simple densification of subchondral bone), requiring no specific treatment. Three complications were noted: one leg deep venous thrombosis, one hematoma, and one deep infection without impacting the initial treatment outcome over the long term. Discussion: The curettage and cementation technique is usual practice in GCT treatment. Simple and reproducible, this technique has a lower rate of complication than other treatment options such as cryotherapy. It produces a lower rate of recurrence with the dual benefit of excellent mechanical and functional qualities. Diagnosis of recurrence can be made earlier because of the thin scalable border at the bone-cement interface. This technique does not generally cause osteoarthritis, which was found in only two cases with no evidence of the cement having a direct effect. The 30% recurrence rate observed in this series shows that the benefit provided by the cement as an adjuvant preservative remains modest. Conclusion: The cement mechanical and cytotoxic properties as well as its innocuity and its ease of handling make curettage and cementation one of the top-ranking GCT treatment options. An even lower rate of recurrence may be obtained through development of additional adjuvant treatments such as calcitonin and bisphosphonates. Level of evidence: Level IV; Therapeutic study.

Texture-specific isotopic compositions in 3.4 Gyr old organic matter support selective preservation in cell-like structures	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article							STRELLEY POOL FORMATION; MICROBIAL SULFATE REDUCTION; BARBERTON GREENSTONE-BELT; ION MASS-SPECTROMETRY; PILBARA CRATON; CARBONACEOUS-MATERIAL; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; APEX CHERT; HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION; RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY	Abundant cell-like organic structures have been proposed as microfossils in Paleoarchean (3.2-3.5 Ga) cherts. The wide range of delta C-13(org) values recorded in Paleoarchean organic matter (OM), including some of these possible microfossils, is difficult to reconcile with the smaller range observed in living cells and younger microfossils. Metamorphic and metasomatic effects on delta C-13(org) have been recognized in Paleoarchean rocks, but have never been assessed for cell-like structures. Migrations of OM, of which the textures can mimic microfossils, are also difficult to constrain in Paleoarchean cherts that are often cut by submillimeter-to meter-scale OM-bearing veins. Here, we present the results of petrography, Raman microspectroscopy, and in situ analyses of delta C-13(org) and H/C using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) of diverse organic microstructures, including possible microfossils, from two localities of the 3.4-billion-year-old Strelley Pool Formation (Western Australia, SPF). For the first time, we show that the wide range of delta C-13(org) values recorded at the micrometer scale correlates with specific OM-texture types in the SPF. The cross-cutting texture and lower structural order show that the OM in micro-veins of one sample from the Goldsworthy greenstone belt (WF4) post-dates all other OM-texture types. Possible microfossils (spheres, lenses), clots and micrometer-scale globules all show a higher structural order reached during peak metamorphism. Other than late micro-veins, textures indicative of OM migration beyond the millimeter-scale are absent; hence the source of clots, lenses, spheres and globules is indigenous to the cherts. A weak positive relation between delta C-13(org) and H/C demonstrates that the 10 parts per thousand range in delta C-13(org) recorded in indigenous OM is not metamorphic or metasomatic in origin. Texture-specific isotopic compositions strongly argue against fully abiotic OM synthesis. Spherical cell-like structures have distinct delta C-13(org) values compared to all other organic textures: their distribution peaks between -35 parts per thousand and -36 parts per thousand in WF4 and averages -35.7 parts per thousand in sample PAN1-1A from the Panorama greenstone belt. Lenses are composed of a network of nanoscale OM with a relatively high H/C and delta C-13(org) (average -32 parts per thousand in WF4), and include globules with lower H/C and delta C-13(org) down to -40 parts per thousand. Similar globules also appear as isolated clusters. In both WF4 and PAN1-1A, delta C-13(org) of OM clots shows a bimodal distribution, the lower values overlapping with those of lenses. These heterogeneities can be explained by different carbon-fixation metabolisms, e.g. photosynthetic high delta C-13(org) lenses versus methanogenic low delta C-13(org) spheres. Alternatively, heterogeneities can be explained by selective diagenetic preservation of the distinct isotopic fractionations inherited from different precursor biomolecules. Selective preservation is supported by (i) coupled delta C-13(org)-H/C heterogeneities, (ii) the delta C-13(org) differences between cell-like structures and recondensed clots, (iii) internal isotopic heterogeneities in SPF lenses similar to heterogeneities in modern and fossil cells. These results support the interpretation of biogenicity of morphologically cellular structures in the SPF. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We have created a new perforated I-beam implant for FNF osteosynthesis and developed a new osteosynthesis philosophy based not only on the mechanical and biomechanical interaction of the bone-implant system, but also on the interaction of the biological properties of the bone and the implant. The purpose of the work is to study the interaction of the biological process of the bone -its regen-eration (germination) of bone tissue into the holes of the implant. Materials and methods: The experiment was carried out on fourteen Chinchilla rabbits in accordance with all international standards. A perforated implant specially made of titanium (ChM, Poland) was surgically implanted into the proximal femur. The implant measurements were as follows: length - 6 mm, width - 3 mm, thickness - 2 mm, 2 holes with a diameter of 2 mm. The 14 rabbits were divided into 7 groups. After 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 and 12 weeks the animals were withdrawn from the experiment according to the standard rules in sequential order. The preparations were placed in a formalin solution and sent to the pathomorphology laboratory (CITO, Russia) for histological studies. Results: Weekly histopathological studies revealed a gradual transition from the organization of a hematoma to the formation of mature bone tissue in the holes of the implants. The titanium implant is bioinert and did not cause any visible reactions from the bone tissue. Simultaneous integration of vas-cular proliferation and newly formed bone tissue into the implant holes were revealed. On 10-12-week preparations, the formation of trabecular structures of mature bone tissue was revealed in the holes of the implants and elements of adipose and bone marrow tissue were observed. Macroscopic examination of 4-5-week preparations showed almost complete filling of the holes with bone tissue. On 10-12-week preparations, the bone tissue in the holes of the implants did not differ from the bone tissue surrounding the implant. The processes of formation of mature bone tissue in the holes of the implants were similar to the processes of physiological bone healing (regeneration) at the fracture site. Conclusions: The obtained results show the following: 1.The titanium implant is bioinert and does not cause any visible reactions from the bone tissue; 2. There is a gradual process of formation of new vessels, and then the formation of new bone tissue in the holes of the implant instead of the one damaged during implantation. Thus, the results of this experiment indirectly confirm our assumption that a perforated implant for FNF osteosynthesis will participate not only in the mechanical and biomechanical interaction of the bone -implant system, but will also include the 3rd element in this system -the biological properties of the bone itself. We assume that these properties of the new implant will increase blood flow in the femoral neck and partially replenish the volume of bone tissue destroyed during osteosynthesis which does not occur with FNF osteosynthesis by any of the known implants.

J	Li, A; Li, KC; Hsieh, CH				Li, Allen; Li, Kung-Chia; Hsieh, Ching-Hsiang			Transpedicle body augmenter for vertebral augmentation in symptomatic multiple osteoporotic compression fractures	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						Vertebral compression fracture; osteoporosis; transpedicle body augmenter	PERCUTANEOUS POLYMETHYLMETHACRYLATE VERTEBROPLASTY; BALLOON KYPHOPLASTY; PULMONARY-EMBOLISM; CEMENT LEAKAGE; PAIN RELIEF; COMPLICATIONS; METHACRYLATE; METASTASES; REDUCTION; WOMEN	Background: Multiple osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) have been treated with polymethylmethacrylate augmentation; however, there are cement complications and long-term fracture healing that are unknown. Transpedicle body augmenter (a porous titanium spacer) has been reported as an internal support to reconstruct the vertebral body combining short-segment fixation in burst fracture and Kummells disease with cord compression. Transpedicle body augmenter for vertebral augmentation (TpBA) also has been reported successfully in treating single painful VCF and vertebral metastasis lesions including pending fractures and pathologic compression fractures. To test the hypothesis that TpBA can effectively and safely treat the symptomatic multiple VCFs, this retrospective study was done by analyzing the radiographic and clinical results. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed clinical and radiographic results of TpBA for symptomatic multiple (more than two levels) VCFs in 62 patients with a total of 236 levels, i.e. 3.8 VCFs per patient. Manual reduction and TpBA via paramedian incisions with blunt dissection were done. One incision was made for two continuous levels and alternative side was selected for next incision. Mean age was 74.3 years (range, 62-87 years), and female-male ratio was 5.2:1. Anterior vertebral height and wedge angle by radiographic findings were measured at preoperative, initial follow-up and final follow-up. Clinical results were assessed by questionnaires and clinical observations. By July 2008, 58 patients returned to answer the questionnaire including quantification of pain on the visual analog scale, the response to operations (better, same, or worse after operation), returned to their pre-fracture function (yes/no) and satisfaction (a scale of 0 = completely dissatisfied to 10 = completely satisfied). Results: The mean symptom duration was 7 months, and follow-up, 48 months. The average operation time was 21 min per level, blood loss was 74 cc per level and hospitalization was 4.4 days. No patient had neurological deterioration. There was no dislodgement of implant in the final visit. Forty-eight patients (77.4) could walk within 6-8 h after operation and the others, within 24 h. The anterior vertebral restoration was 7.3 mm initially and 6.2 mm at final follow-up. Wedge angle correction was 10.4 degrees initially and was 9.3 degrees at final follow-up. Pain, by the visual analog scale, was 8.5 preoperatively, 2.7 at day 7 follow-up and 2.9 at final follow-up. By the questionnaire, 52 of 58 respondents reported a decrease in discomfort after TpBA and 48 of 58 patients reported a return to normal activity after operation. The final satisfaction rate was 89.7. Discussion: The symptoms of multiple osteoporotic compression fracture may be due to unstable fracture, radiculopathy, and global traumatic kyphosis with posture changes, which can be corrected by multiple TpBA. The transpedicle body augmenter was initially stabilized by the sinking and locking mechanism and finally by bone ingrowth. Conclusions: TpBA via a minimally invasive method led to early and medium-term clinical improvements and anatomic restoration of multiple symptomatic VCFs.

Matched case-control study (16 cases vs. 48 controls)	ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH			English	Article						Revision total hip arthroplasty; Dislocation; Dual-mobility cup	ACETABULAR COMPONENT; INSTABILITY; SOCKET; THA; SURVIVORSHIP; PROSTHESIS	Background: Reports of high dislocation rates after revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) have encouraged the widespread use of dual-mobility cups. Dislocation has been less common but not fully abolished with dual-mobility cups, and its causes have remained unidentified. The objectives of this retrospective matched case-control study were: 1) to identify risk factors for dislocation, 2) and to assess dislocation outcomes. Hypothesis: The causes of dislocation after revision THA with a dual -mobility cup can be identified. Material and method: Among 653 consecutive patients identified retrospectively as having undergone revision THA with a dual-mobility cup (Medial Cup, Aston, Saint-Etienne, France) between January 2007 and December 2017,16 (2.45%) subsequently experienced dislocation, after a mean of 3.6 months (range, 0.9-19 months). For each of these 16 patients, we collected the main patient characteristics (age, sex, body mass index [BMI], ASA score, and reason for the initial arthroplasty procedure), local history (number of previous surgical procedures, reason for revision, femoral and acetabular bony defects classified according to Paprosky, and status of the abductor apparatus), and characteristics of the revision (approach, diameters of the cup and femoral head, cup inclination, femoral offset, lower limb length, and implant anteversion). Controls were patients without dislocation after revision dual-mobility THA. Each of the 16 patients was matched to 3 controls on age (f 10 years), sex, year of revision, and whether revision was only acetabular or bipolar. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done to compare the cases and controls, and dislocation outcomes in the cases were evaluated. Results: By univariate analyses, factors associated with dislocation were BMI > 30 (cases, 37.5%; controls, 10.4%; p= 0.02), larger number of previous surgical procedures on the same hip (cases, 2.8; controls, 1.8; p= 0.004), larger number of arthroplasties (cases, 2.3; controls, 1.5; p= 0.004), history of instability (cases, 31% with chronic dislocation and 13% with recurrent dislocation; controls, 6.25% and 2.1%, respectively; p= 0.004), and compromised abductor apparatus (cases, 56.25%; controls, 14.6%; p= 0.002). Independent risk factors for dislocation identified by multivariate analysis were instability (odds ratio [ OR], 14.5; 95% confidence interval [95%CI],1.5-149.9) and, most importantly, abductor apparatus compromise ( OR, 43.1; 95%CI, 3.18-586.3). Of the 16 cases, 1 was lost to follow-up, 1 had contra -indications to anaesthesia, 1 died after several dislocation episodes, and 1 died 3 months after surgical reduction. In 5 cases, there was a single dislocation episode. Further surgery was performed in 8 cases ( surgical reduction, n=1; constrained cup, n=3; trochanteric internal fixation, n=1; exchange of the dual -mobility cup, n= 2, including 1 with subsequent dislocation episodes; and femoral component exchange followed by a retentive cup due to further dislocation episodes, n=1). Conclusion: Risk factors for dislocation consisted of a history of instability and, most importantly, abductor apparatus compromise. A constrained cup should be considererd in patients with impaired abductor apparatus. No further dislocations occurred after reduction of the first episode in 31.25% of cases.

Overall, orthopaedic conditions vary widely in France regarding the patients involved and treatments applied. For PFFs specifically, data are limited. Moreover, the ongoing expansion of geriatric orthopaedics holds promise for improving overall postoperative survival. The objectives of this retrospective study of a nationwide French database were: 1) to describe the pathway of patients with PFFs regarding access to care, healthcare institutions involved, and times to management; 2) to look for associations linking these parameters to post-operative mortality.Hypothesis: Across France, variations exist in healthcare service availability and time to management for patients with PFFs.Material and methods: A retrospective analysis of data in a de-identified representative sample of statutory-health-insurance beneficiaries in France (& Eacute;chantillon g & eacute;n & eacute;raliste des b & eacute;n & eacute;ficiaires, EGB, containing data for 1/97 beneficiaries) was conducted. All patients older than 60 years of age who were managed for PFFs between 2005 and 2017 were included. The following data were collected for each patient: age, management method, Charlson's Comorbidity Index (CCI), home-to-hospital distance by road, and type of hospital (public, non-profit private, or for-profit private), and time to surgery were collected. The study outcomes were the incidence of PFF, mortality during the first postoperative year, changes in mortality between 2005 and 2017, and prognostic factors.Results: In total 8026 fractures were included. The 7561 patients had a median age of 83.8 years and a mean CCI of 4.6; both parameters increased steadily over time, by 0.18 years and 0.06 points per year, respectively (p<10(-4) for both comparisons). Management was by total hip replacement in 3299 cases and internal fixation in 4262 cases; this information was not available for 465 fractures. The overall incidence increased from 90/100,000 in 2008 to 116/100,000 in 2017 (p=0.03). Of the 8026 fractures, 5865 (73.1%) were managed in public hospitals (and this proportion increased significantly over time), 1629 (20.3%) in non-profit private hospitals (decrease over time), and 264 (3.3%) in for-profit private hospitals. The home-to-hospital distance ranged from 7.5 to 38.5km and increased over time by 0.26km/year (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 0.15-0.38) (p<10(-4)). Median time to surgery was 1 day [1-3 days], with no significant difference across hospital types. Mortality rates at 90 days and 1 year were 10.5% (843/8026) and 20.8% (1673/8026), respectively. Two factors were significantly associated with day-90 mortality: the CCI (hazard ratio [HR], 1.087 [95%CI: 1.07-1.10] [p<10(-4)]) and time to surgery>1 day (HR 1.35 [95%CI: 1.15-1.50] [p<0.0001]). Day-90 mortality decreased significantly from 2005 to 2017 (HR 0.95 [95%CI: 0.92-0.97] [p<10(-4)]), with no centre effect.Conclusion: The management of PFF in patients older than 60 varied widely across France. Time to surgery longer than 1 day was a major adverse prognostic factor whose effects persisted throughout the first year. This factor was present in over half the patients. Day-90 mortality decreased significantly from 2005 to 2017 despite increases in age and comorbidities.

The palmar angulation from the fracture displacement is critical for determining treatment, yet there is no consensus regarding the angulation measurement method or the surgical cut-off value. This study aimed to identify a reliable measurement method for assessing palmar angulation. We evaluated inter-observer and intra-observer validation of measuring palmar angulation in oblique plain X-ray and computed tomography (CT) sagittal cuts. Materials and methods We identified surgically treated patients for acute isolated fifth metacarpal neck fracture between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2020, and obtained preoperative, opposite hand, and final follow-up oblique X-rays and sagittal computed tomography (CT) radiograms. The oblique radiograph was taken with a 45 degrees posteroanterior pronation. The metacarpal neck palmar angulation was measured in the radiograms using the metacarpal neck-shaft center (MNSC) angle and the shaft articular surface (SAS) angle methods by three orthopedic surgeons in two sessions. For the CT radiograms, each measurer selected the sagittal slot at their discretion to measure the angle. The final palmar angulation was the average of six measurements (two sessions, three measurers per session). Results The study included 51 patients; the average age was 32.5 (range 18-73) years, with 46 men and 5 women. The MNSC angle inter-observer reliability was better than the SAS angle. The MNSC angle inter-observer reliability was better than that of SAS angle. Intraclass coefficients (ICCs) for the MNSC angle demonstrated an excellent inter-observer agreement among the three measurers in the first (0.93) and second (0.88) session compared to ICCs for the SAS angle in the first (0.81) and second (0.87) session. The MNSC angle intra-observer reliability was also better than the SAS angle, with higher ICCs. Preoperative CT radiograms were available for 42 patients. Using CT scans for measurements, in the two sessions, the MNSC angle inter-observer reliability was higher than that of the SAS angle [MNSC: 0.83; SAS: 0.35], second [MSNC: 0.85; SAS: 0.81]. The intra-observer reliability was also better in the MNSC angle. When comparing average value among obtained radiograms, the physiologic angulation of the opposite hand oblique X-ray had the smallest average value, followed by preoperative CT and preoperative oblique radiography. Overall, the SAS angle measurement had a slightly larger angle than the MNSC method in the fractured and non-fractured hand measurements. Finally, a serial comparison of the oblique X-rays (pre-and postoperative, final follow-up, and the opposite hand with closed reduction and internal fixation) indicated that the angulation significantly decreased, and the post-operative values did not differ from the final follow-up X-ray for either method. Conclusions The palmar angulation measurement in 45 degrees pronated oblique X-ray using the MNSC angle method had good-to-excellent reliability, with superior results to sagittal CT radiograms. Although the angle is likely overestimated, the MNSC method is reliable for judging the fracture degree and reduction adequacy after surgery compared to the non-fractured hand physiologic angulation.

Currently, based on the internal fixation of fractures, the available drug treatments mainly focus on either inhibiting osteoclast function, such as bisphosphonate, calcitonin, oestrogen or promoting osteogenesis, such as parathyroid hormones. However, the availability of current antiosteoporotic drugs in promoting osteoporotic fracture healing is limited. The objective of the present study was to investigate the ability of the MiR-21/nanocapsule to enhance the early bone repair of osteoporotic fractures. Methods: Based on the presence of matrix metalloproteinases that are overexpressed at the fracture site, we designed the matrix metalloproteinase-sensitive nanocapsules which were formed by in situ free radical polymerisation on the surface of MiR-21 with 2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl phosphorylcholine and the bisacryloylated VPLGVRTK peptide. The MiR-21/nanocapsule [n (miR-21)] and 0-carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) were mixed until they formed a gel-like material [CMCS/n (miR-21)] with good fluidity and injectability. Thirty elderly Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (female, 14-month-old, 380 +/- 10 g) were subjected to bilateral removal of the ovaries (ovariectomised). All rats were subjected to bilateral bone defects (2 mm diameter) of the proximal tibia and randomly divided into three groups (groups A, B, and C): separately injected with CMCS/n (miR-21), CMCS/n (NC-miR), and saline. Micro-computed tomography (CT) imaging was performed to evaluate newly formed bone volume and connectivity. Nondecalcified histology and toluidine blue staining were performed to measure the effects of CMCS/n (miR-21) on bone repair. In vitro, the effect of n (miR-21) on osteogenic differentiation to bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) which derived from the ovariectomised rat model was observed. Results: The morphology of n (miR-21) was a regular spherical nanocapsule with a uniform small size (25-35 nm). The results confirmed that n (miR-21) could be efficiently phagocytosed by BMSCs and released in the cytoplasm to promote osteogenesis. The expression level of alkaline phosphatase and Runt-related transcription factor 2 mRNA in the n (miR-21) group was higher than that in the n (NC-miR) group. Animal experiments proved that CMCS/n (miR-21) produced better bone repair compared with the CMCS/n (NC-miR) group in the early stages of fracture healing at 4 weeks. In the late stage of fracture healing (8 weeks), micro-CT quantitative analysis showed that the new bone trabeculae in the CMCS/n (miR-21) group has decreased compared with the CMCS/n (NC-miR) group. In the CMCS/n (miR-21) group, the new cancellous bone had been absorbed, and the process of bone healing was almost completed. In contrast, the new bone in the CMCS/n (NC-miR) and the control groups was still in the healing process. Conclusion The cytological tests confirmed that n (miR-21) can promote osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs derived from the osteoporosis rat model. Furthermore, the results of animal tests demonstrated that local injection of CMCS/n (miR-21) promoted the early healing of osteoporotic bone defects. Consequently CMCS/n (miR-21) promoted the bone repair process to enter the moulding phase earlier. The translational potential of this article: CMCS/n (miR-21) can be widely applied to elderly patients with osteoporotic fractures. This method can help patients with osteoporotic fractures recover earlier and avoid serious complications. It provides a potential approach for the clinical treatment of osteoporotic fractures in the elderly.

Patient Characteristics, Treatment, and Presenting PROMIS Scores Associated with Number of Office Visits for Traumatic Hand and Wrist Conditions	CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH			English	Article							FOLLOW-UP; INTERNAL-FIXATION; DEPRESSION; FRACTURES; PAIN; VALIDITY	Background Overuse of healthcare resources is burdensome on society. Prior research has demonstrated that many patients with traumatic musculoskeletal injuries continue to seek care long after appropriate healing is well established, suggesting an overuse of services. However, few studies have examined the factors-including patient-reported outcomes-associated with an increased number of clinic visits for traumatic hand and wrist conditions. Questions/purposes (1) After accounting for surgical treatment, surgeon, and demographic factors, is a patient's PROMIS Pain Interference score associated with the total number of office visits? (2) Is PROMIS Depression, combination of PROMIS Depression and Pain Interference, or Physical Function scores associated with the number of office visits? Methods Between June 2015 and May 2018, 1098 patients presenting for a new patient visit at a single, urban academic medical center for distal radius fracture, wrist or hand sprain, tendon rupture, traumatic finger amputation, or scaphoid fracture were identified. Of those, 823 (75%) patients completed all PROMIS domains and presented before the trailing period and thus were included in this retrospective study. We recorded a number of variables including: Total number of office visits, age, sex, race, marital status, diagnosis, provider, and operative or nonoperative treatment. Multivariable Poisson regression analysis was conducted to determine whether Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Pain Interference (PROMIS PI), Physical Function (PROMIS PF), and Depression scores measured at the first visit were associated with the total number of office visits, after accounting for the other factors we measured. Results Higher PROMIS PI scores were associated with greater number of clinic visits (0.0077; 95% CI, 0.0018-0.014; p = 0.010). Although PROMIS Depression scores were not associated with the number of office visits (0.0042; 95% CI, -0.0099 to 0.0094; p = 0.112), higher PROMIS PF scores were associated with fewer office visits when accounting for confounding variables (-0.0077; 95% CI, -0.0012 to -0.0029; p = 0.001). Additionally, across all individual PROMIS models, there was an association between the variables "operative treatment" (PI: 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72-0.98; p < 0.001; Depression: 0.87; 95% CI, 0.74-1.0; p < 0.001; PF: 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72-0.99; p < 0.001) and "traumatic finger amputation" (PI: 0.22; 95% CI, 0.016-0.42; p = 0.034; Depression: 0.2; 95% CI, 0.086-0.47; p = 0.005; PF: 0.21; 95% CI, 0.014-0.41; p = 0.036) with an increased total number of office visits. Provider team 5 (PI: -0.62; 95% CI, -0.98 to -0.27; p = 0.001; Depression: -0.61; 95% CI, -0.96 to -0.26; p = 0.001; PF: -0.60; 95% CI, -0.96 to -0.25; p = 0.001) was associated with fewer office visits. In both the PROMIS Depression and PROMIS PF regression models, increasing age (Depression: -0.0048; 95% CI, -0.0088 to -0.00081; p = 0.018; PF: -0.0045; 95% CI, -0.0085 to -0.0006; p = 0.024) was also associated with fewer total number of office visits. Conclusions This study helps surgeons understand that patients who present at their initial office visit for traumatic hand and wrist conditions displaying worse pain coping strategies and decreased physical function will have more office visits. We recommend that surgeons engage in a comprehensive care approach that is empathetic, fosters effective pain coping strategies (and so might decrease PROMIS PI scores), and educates patients about expectations by providing educational materials and/or including other health professionals (such as, social work, physical therapy, mental health professional) as needed. This may decrease healthcare use in patients with traumatic hand and wrist conditions.
